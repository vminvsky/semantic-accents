such information [38] (the authors find a similar reference in the work of Buniyatov [39]) The authors also give an example where Mamedova, referring to Stephen of Syuni, distorts his message about the presence of several dialects, directly called by Stephen of Syuni Armenian dialects, presenting it as a message about the existence of various languages [40] The authors note that Mamedova criticizes the Armenian author of the late fifth century Pavstos Buzand for his tendentious attempt to prepare the population for the anti-Persian uprising that took place before Pavstos Buzand wrote the work [41] A A Akopyan, P M Muradyan, and K N Yuzbashyan summarize Mamedova's work as follows: \n\n\nState support for history falsification\nV A Schnirelmann notes that there is a direct state order for publications with distortions of the source texts in Azerbaijan, designed to \"clear\" the history of Armenians:\n\n\nFormation of the image of the \"enemy\" in Azerbaijan and Armenia\nSergei Rumyantsev, candidate of sociological sciences, director of the Novator Center for Social Research, notes that the Karabakh war caused a complete break between Armenians and Azerbaijanis In Azerbaijan, this led to the formation of an image of a victim, combined with revanchist aspirations On the other hand, in Armenia, where genocide has become the main factor shaping identity, Azerbaijanis are promoted as de facto Turks [60] As an example, the researcher cites the construction of the image of a \"historical enemy\" on the basis of a literary work of the Turkic world of the 11th–12th centuries \"Kitabi Dede Gorgud\", which is not only presented as a \"historical chronicle of our fatherland\", that is, Azerbaijan, aged thirteen centuries, but also the replacement of the Kipchak tribes (which served in the Turkic epic as an authentic image of the \"infidels\" with whom the Oguzes fought) by the Armenians and Georgians As the author notes, \"basically all the appeals to the text of the epic in the textbooks were intended to serve as the basis for the constructed image of the\" historical enemy \" The events of recent years .. have led to the fact that this \"honorable\" place was taken first of all by the Armenians\" Sergei Rumyantsev illustrates this with the example of a school textbook on Azerbaijani history (Ya Mahmudlu, R Khalilov, S Agayev Fatherland Textbook for grade V Third edition Baku, 2003) [61] Since the publication of textbooks is controlled by the state, we are talking, according to Rumyantsev, about the state political order, carried out by historians According to independent experts in Armenia and Azerbaijan, this policy makes the differences more and more insurmountable every year A generation of young people has grown up, for whom \"Armenian\" and \"Azeri\" have become an ideological cliché, an image of an \"enemy\" [60]\n\n\nSee also\nХасан-Джалалян происходил из знатной армянской фамилии

and Historical Geography of Caucasian Albania\" [36] in confirmation of his the concept of the Armenian-Albanian border distorts the quotation of S.V Yushkov, [37] refers to books that do not contain such information [38] (the authors find a similar reference in the work of Buniyatov [39]) The authors also give an example where Mamedova, referring to Stephen of Syuni, distorts his message about the presence of several dialects, directly called by Stephen of Syuni Armenian dialects, presenting it as a message about the existence of various languages [40] The authors note that Mamedova criticizes the Armenian author of the late fifth century Pavstos Buzand for his tendentious attempt to prepare the population for the anti-Persian uprising that took place before Pavstos Buzand wrote the work [41] A A Akopyan, P M Muradyan, and K N Yuzbashyan summarize Mamedova's work as follows: \n\n\nState support for history falsification\nV A Schnirelmann notes that there is a direct state order for publications with distortions of the source texts in Azerbaijan, designed to \"clear\" the history of Armenians:\n\n\nFormation of the image of the \"enemy\" in Azerbaijan and Armenia\nSergei Rumyantsev, candidate of sociological sciences, director of the Novator Center for Social Research, notes that the Karabakh war caused a complete break between Armenians and Azerbaijanis In Azerbaijan, this led to the formation of an image of a victim, combined with revanchist aspirations On the other hand, in Armenia, where genocide has become the main factor shaping identity, Azerbaijanis are promoted as de facto Turks [60] As an example, the researcher cites the construction of the image of a \"historical enemy\" on the basis of a literary work of the Turkic world of the 11th–12th centuries \"Kitabi Dede Gorgud\", which is not only presented as a \"historical chronicle of our fatherland\", that is, Azerbaijan, aged thirteen centuries, but also the replacement of the Kipchak tribes (which served in the Turkic epic as an authentic image of the \"infidels\" with whom the Oguzes fought) by the Armenians and Georgians As the author notes, \"basically all the appeals to the text of the epic in the textbooks were intended to serve as the basis for the constructed image of the\" historical enemy \" The events of recent years .. have led to the fact that this \"honorable\" place was taken first of all by the Armenians\" Sergei Rumyantsev illustrates this with the example of a school textbook on Azerbaijani history (Ya Mahmudlu, R Khalilov, S Agayev Fatherland Textbook for grade V Third edition Baku, 2003) [61] Since the publication of textbooks is controlled by the state, we are talking, according to Rumyantsev, about the state political order, carried out by historians According to independent experts in Armenia and Azerbaijan, this policy makes the differences more and more insurmountable every year A generation of young people has grown up, for whom \"Armenian\" and \"Azeri\" have become an ideological cliché, an image of an \"enemy\" [60]\n\n\nSee also\nХасан-Джалалян происходил из знатной армянской фамилии

The Navajo people have a deep respect for the land, animals, and the spirits that inhabit it. This respect is reflected in their folklore, where skin-walkers are often depicted as beings that have transcended the natural world and have acquired supernatural powers.\n\n**Legend**\n\nAnimals associated with witchcraft usually include tricksters such as the coyote; however, it may include other creatures, usually those associated with death or bad omens. They might also possess living animals or people and walk around in their bodies. Skin-walkers may be male or female.\n\nAccording to Navajo legend, skin-walkers are individuals who have gained the power to transform into various animals or humans through their practice of witchcraft. This power is often acquired through the use of magical rituals and the consumption of certain plants or substances.\n\nSkin-walkers are said to possess supernatural abilities, such as the ability to shape-shift, move undetected, and communicate with other supernatural beings. They are also believed to be able to curse or harm individuals who have wronged them or their kin.\n\nIn Navajo culture, skin-walkers are often depicted as being associated with death, disease, and misfortune. They are said to roam the land, seeking out individuals who are vulnerable or have committed wrongdoings. Skin-walkers are also believed to be able to possess the bodies of others, causing them to act strangely or commit acts of violence.\n\n**Types of Skin-walkers**\n\nThere are several types of skin-walkers in Navajo culture, each with its own unique characteristics and abilities. Some of the most common types of skin-walkers include:\n\n* **Yee naaldlooshii**: A type of skin-walker that can transform into various animals or humans, often associated with witchcraft and the supernatural.\n* **'ánti'įhnii**: A type of skin-walker that can transform into a wolf or other animals, often associated with death and misfortune.\n* **Tł'įį'**: A type of skin-walker that can transform into a coyote or other animals, often associated with trickery and cunning.\n* **Dine'é**: A type of skin-walker that can transform into a human or animal, often associated with spiritual and mystical practices.\n\n**Prevention and Protection**\n\nAccording to Navajo tradition, individuals can protect themselves from skin-walkers by performing certain rituals and practices. Some of these practices include:\n\n* **Purification ceremonies**: Rituals that are performed to cleanse an individual of evil spirits or negative energies.\n* **Protection charms**: Talismans or amulets that are believed to ward off evil spirits or skin-walkers.\n* **Respect for the land**: Showing respect for the natural world and the spirits that inhabit it.\n* **Avoiding witchcraft**: Avoiding the practice of witchcraft and the consumption of certain plants or substances that are associated with skin-walkers.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe concept of skin-walkers is a complex and multifaceted aspect of Navajo culture, reflecting their deep respect for the natural world and their place within it.

He is best known for his work on a wide range of films, including comedies, dramas, and horror movies. Reitman's career spans over four decades, and he has established himself as one of the most successful and respected filmmakers in the industry.\n\n# Early Life\n\nIvan Reitman was born in the town of Komárno, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), on October 27, 1946. His parents, Klara (Raab) and Ladislav \"Leslie\" Reitman, were Jewish-Hungarians. Reitman's mother survived the Auschwitz concentration camp, and his father was an underground resistance fighter. Reitman's family arrived in Canada as refugees when he was four years old. He grew up in Toronto, Ontario, and developed an interest in music and filmmaking from an early age.\n\n## Education\n\nReitman attended Oakwood Collegiate in Toronto, where he was a member of the school's choir and developed his singing skills. He later attended McMaster University, where he received a Bachelor of Music in 1969. During his time at McMaster, Reitman produced and directed many short films, which helped him develop his skills as a filmmaker.\n\n# Career\n\nReitman's first producing job was with the then-new station CITY-TV in Toronto. CITY-TV was also the home of the first announcing job of his later friend and collaborator, Dan Aykroyd. However, Reitman's tenure at CITY-TV was short-lived, as he was fired during his first year by station owner Moses Znaimer. Despite this setback, Reitman continued to work in the film industry, eventually landing a job as a producer for a film production company.\n\n## Film Work\n\nReitman's first film as a director was the 1977 comedy film \"For Your Consideration,\" which starred Geneviève Robert, his future wife. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it helped establish Reitman as a rising talent in the film industry. Over the next several years, Reitman directed a number of films, including the 1980 comedy \"Meatballs,\" which starred Bill Murray, and the 1982 horror film \"Poltergeist,\" which was produced by Steven Spielberg.\n\n## Television Work\n\nIn addition to his film work, Reitman also worked in television, producing and directing a number of TV shows and specials. One of his most notable TV projects was the 1980s sitcom \"Big Shrimpin',\" which starred John Candy and Eugene Levy.\n\n## Music Video Work\n\nReitman also worked on a number of music videos, including videos for the bands The Police and The Rolling Stones.\n\n# Unmade Projects\n\nOver the course of his career, Reitman has been involved in a number of unmade projects. One of the most notable of these was a film version of the Batman franchise, which was to be directed by Reitman and produced by Steven Spielberg. The film was to star Bill Murray as Batman, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, William Holden as Commissioner James Gordon, and singer David Bowie as the Joker. However, the project was eventually abandoned due to the deaths of Holden and Niven, as well as rewrites of the script. Reitman left the project, and it was eventually replaced by Gremlins director Joe Dante.\n\n# Personal Life and Death\n\nReitman married Geneviève Robert in 1976. The couple had two daughters and a son, Jason, who is a film director. Reitman's daughter Catherine is the creator, executive producer, writer, and star of the CBC comedy series Workin' Moms. His other daughter, Caroline, is a nurse in San Diego, California. Reitman and his French-Canadian wife, who converted to Judaism, raised their children in the same tradition.\n\nReitman passed away on February 12, 2022, at the age of 75.\n\n# Filmography\n\n## Short Film\n\n* \"For Your Consideration\" (1977)\n* \"Meatballs\" (1980)\n* \"Poltergeist\" (1982)\n\n## Film\n\n* \"For Your Consideration\" (1977)\n* \"Meatballs\" (1980)\n* \"Poltergeist\" (1982)\n* \"Stripes\" (1981)\n* \"Ghostbusters\" (1984)\n* \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990)\n* \"Twins\" (1988)\n* \"Junior\" (1994)\n* \"Multiplicity\" (1996)\n* \"Evolution\" (2001)\n* \"My Super Ex-Girlfriend\" (2006)\n\n## Television\n\n* \"Big Shrimpin'\" (1984)\n* \"Ghostbusters: The Animated Series\" (1997-1998)\n\n## Music Video\n\n* \"The Police - Every Breath You Take\" (1983)\n* \"The Rolling Stones - Harlem Shuffle\" (1986)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ivan_Reitman\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nIvan Reitman was born in the town of Komárno, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), on October 27, 1946, the son of Klara (Raab) and Ladislav \"Leslie\" Reitman [1] Both of Reitman's parents were Jewish-Hungarians; his mother survived the Auschwitz concentration camp, and his father was an underground resistance fighter [2] [3] [4] His family arrived in Canada as refugees when Reitman was four years old Reitman attended Oakwood Collegiate in Toronto and was a member of the Twintone Four singing group [citation needed] He attended McMaster University, [5] receiving a Bachelor of Music in 1969 At McMaster he produced and directed many short films [6]\n\n\nCareer\nReitman's first producing job was with the then-new station CITY-TV in Toronto CITY was also the home of the first announcing job of his later friend and collaborator Dan Aykroyd However, Reitman's tenure at CITY was short and he was fired during his first year by station owner Moses Znaimer [citation needed]\n\n\nUnmade projects\nIn the early 1980s, Tom Mankiewicz wrote a script for a film titled The Batman, with Reitman attached to direct He planned to cast Meatballs star Bill Murray as Batman, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, William Holden as Commissioner James Gordon, and singer David Bowie as Joker [18] Following the deaths of Holden and Niven and rewrites of the script, Reitman left the project and was replaced by Gremlins director Joe Dante, but the film was never made.\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nReitman married Geneviève Robert in 1976 He had two daughters and a son, Jason, who is a film director best known for his films Juno, Thank You for Smoking, Up in the Air and Ghostbusters: Afterlife His daughter Catherine is the creator, executive producer, writer and star of the CBC comedy series Workin' Moms His other daughter, Caroline, is a nurse in San Diego, California He and his French-Canadian wife, who converted to Judaism, brought up their children in the same tradition [35]\n\n\nFilmography\nShort film\n\n\nFilm\nShort film\n\n\nTelevision\nExecutive producer only\n\n\nMusic video\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the second installment in the Fear Street trilogy, which is based on the young adult horror novel series by R.L. Stine. The movie follows a group of teenagers as they try to uncover the dark secrets behind a series of mysterious events that took place at Camp Nightwing in 1978.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1994, where Deena and Josh Johnson, the main characters from the first film, are dealing with the aftermath of the events that occurred in the previous movie. They are trying to move on with their lives, but they are haunted by the memories of what happened at Camp Nightwing. Deena's girlfriend, Sam, is possessed by the spirit of the main antagonist from the first film, and she is causing chaos in the town.\n\nDeena and Josh decide to go to C. Berman's house, a local historian who has been researching the history of Camp Nightwing, to seek his help. Initially, Berman is reluctant to let them in, but he eventually allows them to enter his house and begins to recount the events of the Camp Nightwing massacre that took place in 1978.\n\nAs Berman tells his story, Deena and Josh are transported back in time to 1978, where they witness the events that led to the massacre. They see a group of teenagers, including a character named Kate, who is the main protagonist of the story, and her friends, who are trying to survive in the woods.\n\nThe movie follows a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards, as Deena and Josh try to piece together the events of 1978 and understand what happened to Kate and her friends. Along the way, they encounter a series of supernatural creatures, including a ghostly figure who is haunting the woods.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Deena and Josh realize that the events of 1978 are connected to the present, and that Sam's possession is the key to unlocking the secrets of the past. They must work together to uncover the truth and put an end to the curse that has been haunting the town for decades.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented young cast, including Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, and Ryan Simpkins, who all deliver standout performances. The movie also features a supporting cast of experienced actors, including Olivia Scriven, Fred Hechinger, and Kiana Madeira.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Fear Street Part Two: 1978 began in 2015, when 20th Century Studios and Chernin Entertainment announced that they were developing a film based on the Fear Street series. The project was initially assigned to screenwriter Zak Olkewicz, who wrote the script for the second film while Kyle Killen and Silka Lusia were assigned to write the first and third films, respectively.\n\nIn 2017, Leigh Janiak was hired to direct and rewrite the films, and she oversaw a writers room with her writing partner, Phil Graziadei. The film was shot back-to-back with the first and third installments, with the intention of releasing the films one month apart.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Fear Street Part Two: 1978 was composed by Marco Beltrami, who is known for his work on a number of horror films. The score is a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, and it perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released theatrically in June 2020, but it was pulled from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, Chernin Entertainment ended their distribution deal with 20th Century Studios and made a multi-year first-look deal with Netflix.\n\nBy August 2020, Netflix had acquired the distribution rights to the Fear Street trilogy, and the film was released on the platform on July 9, 2021. The film premiered at the Los Angeles State Historic Park on July 8, 2021, and it received a positive reaction from critics and audiences alike.\n\n**Reception**\n\nFear Street Part Two: 1978 received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the film's clever subversion of the slasher genre and its well-developed characters. The film holds an approval rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9/10.\n\nThe website's critics consensus states, \"A smart and subversive twist on slasher horror, Fear Street Part II: 1978 shows that summer camp has never been scarier thanks to stellar performances from Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, and Ryan Simpkins.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n**Sequel**\n\nThe Fear Street trilogy continues with Part Three: 1666, which was released on July 16, 2021. The movie takes place in the 17th century and follows a group of teenagers as they try to uncover the secrets behind a series of mysterious events that took place in the town.\n\nThe film features a talented young cast, including Kiana Madeira, Emily Rudd, and Sadie Sink, who all deliver standout performances.

{"title": "Dune_(novel)", "content": "\nOrigins\nAfter his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could \"swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways.\" [4] Herbert's article on the dunes, \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\", was never completed (and only published decades later in The Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts [5]\n\n\nPlot\nDuke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean world Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of melange, or the \"spice\", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan It is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel The Emperor is jealous of the Duke's rising popularity in the Landsraad, the council of Great Houses, and sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat He conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.\n\n\nCharacters\nThe Dune series is a landmark of science fiction Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity [14] Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time [1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n\n\nThemes and influences\nThe Dune series is a landmark of science fiction Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity [14] Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time [1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n\n\nMiddle-Eastern and Islamic references\nDue to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the series' \"Islamic undertones\" and themes, a Middle-Eastern influence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly [29] [30] In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words [31] [32] For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from Arabic: شيء خلود, romanized: šayʾ ḫulūd, lit. 'immortal thing' or Arabic: شيخ خلود, romanized: šayḫ ḫulūd, lit. 'old man of eternity' [33] [32] The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the Arabic: شادوف, romanized: šādūf, the Egyptian term for a device used to raise water [32] In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from Arabic: مؤدب, romanized: muʾaddib, lit. 'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (from Arabic: لسان الغيب, romanized: lisān al-ġayb, lit. 'voice of the unseen') Usul (from Arabic: أصول, romanized: ʾuṣūl, lit. 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (from Arabic: شريعة, romanized: šarīʿa, lit. 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from Arabic: شيطان, romanized: šayṭān, lit. 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (from Arabic: جن, romanized: ǧinn, lit. 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being') [29] It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen [32] They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic [32]\n\n\nAdditional language and historic influences\nIn addition to Arabic, Dune derives words and names from a variety of other languages, including Navajo, Latin, Dutch (\"Landsraad\"), Romani, Hebrew (\"Kefitzat haderech\", in Hebrew \"קפיצת הדרך\", meaning contracting of the path), Serbo-Croatian, Nahuatl, Greek, Persian, Sanskrit (\"prana bindu\", \"prajna\"), Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Old English [40] [41] Bene Gesserit is part of the Latin legal phrase quamdiu se bene gesserit \"as long as he shall behave himself well\" seen in grants of certain offices (such as judgeships) meaning that the appointee shall remain in office so long as he shall not be guilty of abusing it Some critics miss the connotation of the phrase, misled by the Latin future perfect gesserit, taking it over-literally (and adding an unwarranted passive) to mean \"it will have been well borne\", an interpretation which is not well supported by the Bene Gesserit doctrine in the story [42] [original research?]\n\n\nEnvironmentalism and ecology\nDune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\" [46] Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\" [47] It was reviewed in the best selling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community\" [48]\n\n\nDeclining empires\nThe Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and the Near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and Ottoman Empire [52] [33] [53] Lorenzo DiTommaso compared Dune's portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome In \"The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction\" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\" The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent Gibbon's Decline and Fall partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others [54]\n\n\nGender dynamics\nGender dynamics are complex in Dune Herbert offers a multi-layered portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical society, particularly through the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood Although the Bene Gesserit tend to hold roles that are traditionally associated with women, such as wives, concubines, and mothers, their characters transcend stereotypes as they play politics and pursue long-term strategic goals Full gender equality is not depicted in Dune, but the Bene Gesserit use specialized training and access to high-ranking men to gain agency and power within the constraints of their environment Their training in prana-bindu allows them to exert control over their minds and bodies, including over pregnancy, and they are skilled in hand-to-hand combat and use of the Voice to command others Jessica's disobedience in bearing a son instead of daughter and training him in the Bene Gesserit Way is a major plot point that sets in motion the events of the novel [57] [58] By setting up certain women with leaders of certain Houses in the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit can control bloodlines across generations through their secret breeding program [59] Even within the male-dominated Imperium, then, the Bene Gesserit wield reproductive power and choose which genetic markers to continue into the future [60]\n\n\nHeroism\nI am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.\n\nZen and religion\nEarly in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to Zen by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\" [74] Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on  [Herbert's] work\" [74] Throughout the Dune series and particularly in Dune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism [74] [75] The Fremen are referred to as Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited [76] In \"Dune Genesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:\n\n\nAsimov's Foundation\nTim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series In his monograph on Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that \"Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation trilogy Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions The twist he has introduced into Dune is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.\" [79] According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science [79] In contrast to the Foundation series and its praise of science and rationality, Dune proposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity [79]\n\n\nCritical reception\nDune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 [82] and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel [83] Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written [84] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies [85] Dune has been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels [86] [3]\n\n\nFirst edition prints and manuscripts\nThe first edition of Dune is one of the most valuable in science fiction book collecting Copies have been sold for more than $20,000 at auction [94]\n\n\nSequels and prequels\nAfter Dune proved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writing Dune [14] The series included Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative from Dune Herbert died on February 11, 1986 [96]\n\n\nAdaptations\nDune has been considered an \"unfilmable\" and \"uncontainable\" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium [98] Described by Wired, \"It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.\" [99] There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success [100]\n\n\nEarly stalled attempts\nIn 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by Arthur P Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was delayed for another year Jacobs' first choice for director was David Lean, but he turned down the offer Charles Jarrott was also considered to direct Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued Initially, the first treatment had been handled by Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974 However, Jacobs died in 1973 [101]\n\n\n1984 film by David Lynch\nIn 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels (written and unwritten) After seeing The Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughter Raffaella decided that David Lynch should direct the movie Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, including Return of the Jedi He agreed to direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction [108] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline [109] Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage [110]\n\n\n2000 miniseries by John Harrison\nIn 2000, John Harrison adapted the novel into Frank Herbert's Dune, a miniseries that premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel [17] As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel [116]\n\n\nFurther film attempts\nIn 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct [117] Producer Kevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci-Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina [117] The producers stated that

a science fiction novel written by American author Frank Herbert, published in 1965. The novel is set in a distant future where humans have colonized other planets across the galaxy. The story takes place on the desert planet Arrakis, where a rare and valuable resource called melange, also known as \"the spice,\" is found. The spice extends human life, expands consciousness, and allows for interstellar travel.\n\n**Origins**\n\nFrank Herbert's inspiration for Dune came from his visit to the Oregon Dunes in 1957. He was struck by the vast expanse of sand dunes and the potential for ecological disaster if the dunes were not stabilized. This experience sparked his interest in ecology and deserts, which would later become central themes in Dune.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe novel follows the story of Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides, who is appointed by the Emperor to rule over the planet Arrakis. However, the Emperor's intentions are far from benevolent, and he conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis, to destroy the Atreides family. Paul, aware of the danger, must navigate the complexities of politics and ecology to ensure the survival of his family and the future of humanity.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe Dune series is a landmark of science fiction, and its characters are complex and multi-dimensional. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, a powerful organization of women, play a crucial role in the story, using their advanced training and abilities to manipulate events from behind the scenes. The Fremen, a native population of Arrakis, are also central to the story, using their knowledge of the planet and its ecology to resist the Emperor's rule.\n\n**Themes and Influences**\n\nDune explores various themes, including ecology, politics, and the dangers of unchecked power. The novel draws inspiration from real-world events, such as the rise of the Roman Empire and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Dune universe is also heavily influenced by Middle Eastern and Islamic cultures, with many Arabic and Persian words and concepts incorporated into the narrative.\n\n**Environmentalism and Ecology**\n\nDune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale.\" Herbert's novel explores the delicate balance between human society and the natural environment, highlighting the importance of conservation and sustainability. The novel's themes of ecological disaster and the consequences of human actions are eerily relevant to contemporary issues, such as climate change and environmental degradation.\n\n**Declining Empires**\n\nThe Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and the Near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and Ottoman Empire. The novel's portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire is reminiscent of Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome.\n\n**Gender Dynamics**\n\nDune offers a complex and nuanced portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical society. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood plays a significant role in the story, using their advanced training and abilities to manipulate events from behind the scenes. The novel also explores the themes of reproductive power and the control of genetic markers.\n\n**Heroism**\n\nThe novel critiques the concept of heroism, suggesting that it is often based on flawed assumptions and a simplistic view of the world. The protagonist, Paul Atreides, is a complex and multi-dimensional character who is driven by a desire for power and control. The novel challenges the reader to question their assumptions about heroism and the nature of leadership.\n\n**Zen and Religion**\n\nFrank Herbert's work is heavily influenced by Zen Buddhism, and the novel incorporates many Zen concepts and ideas. The Fremen are referred to as Zensunni adherents, and many of the novel's epigraphs are Zen-spirited. The novel explores the themes of spiritual awakening and the search for meaning in a complex and often chaotic world.\n\n**Asimov's Foundation**\n\nDune has been seen as a counterpoint to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. While Asimov's novel explores the theme of a scientific utopia, Dune critiques the idea of a rational and predictable universe. The novel suggests that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity to survive and thrive.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nDune has been widely praised for its complex and nuanced portrayal of science fiction themes. The novel has won numerous awards, including the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Hugo Award for Best Novel. It has also been translated into dozens of languages and has sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nThe novel has been adapted into various forms, including film, television, and video games. The 1984 film directed by David Lynch was a critical and commercial failure, but it has since become a cult classic. The 2000 miniseries directed by John Harrison was more successful, but it was also criticized for its changes to the original story.\n\n**Cultural Influence**\n\nDune has had a significant impact on popular culture, influencing various forms of media, including science fiction, fantasy, and horror. The novel's themes of ecology, politics, and spirituality have resonated with audiences around the world, making it a classic of science fiction literature.\n\n**Games**\n\nThere have been numerous video games based on the novel, starting with the 1992 game Dune. The most influential game adaptation is Dune II, which established the conventions of modern real-time strategy games. The game has been praised for its complex gameplay and its faithfulness to the original novel.\n\n**Space Exploration**\n\nThe Apollo 15 astronauts named a small crater on the Moon after the novel during the 1971 mission. The name was formally adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1973. Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Frank Herbert\n* Dune

in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could \"swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways.\" [4] Herbert's article on the dunes, \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\", was never completed (and only published decades later in The Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts [5]\n\n\nPlot\nDuke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean world Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of melange, or the \"spice\", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan It is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel The Emperor is jealous of the Duke's rising popularity in the Landsraad, the council of Great Houses, and sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat He conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.\n\n\nCharacters\nThe Dune series is a landmark of science fiction Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity [14] Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time [1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n\n\nThemes and influences\nThe Dune series is a landmark of science fiction Herbert deliberately suppressed

\"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity [14] Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time [1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n\n\nMiddle-Eastern and Islamic references\nDue to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the series' \"Islamic undertones\" and themes, a Middle-Eastern influence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly [29] [30] In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words [31] [32] For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from Arabic: شيء خلود, romanized: šayʾ ḫulūd, lit. 'immortal thing' or Arabic: شيخ خلود, romanized: šayḫ ḫulūd, lit. 'old man of eternity' [33] [32] The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the Arabic: شادوف, romanized: šādūf, the Egyptian term for a device used to raise water [32] In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from Arabic: مؤدب, romanized: muʾaddib, lit. 'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (from Arabic: لسان الغيب, romanized: lisān al-ġayb, lit. 'voice of the unseen') Usul (from Arabic: أصول, romanized: ʾuṣūl, lit. 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (from Arabic: شريعة, romanized: šarīʿa, lit. 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from Arabic: شيطان, romanized: šayṭān, lit. 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (from Arabic: جن, romanized: ǧinn, lit. 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being') [29] It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen [32] They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic [32]\n\n\nAdditional language and historic influences\nIn addition to Arabic, Dune derives words and names from a variety of other languages, including Navajo, Latin, Dutch (\"Landsraad\"), Romani, Hebrew (\"Kefitzat haderech\", in Hebrew \"קפיצת הדרך\", meaning contracting of the path), Serbo-Croatian, Nahuatl, Greek, Persian, Sanskrit (\"prana bindu\", \"prajna\"), Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Old English [40] [41] Bene Gesserit is part of the Latin legal phrase quamdiu se bene gesserit \"as long as he shall behave himself well\" seen in grants of certain offices (such as judgeships) meaning that the appointee shall remain in office so long as he shall not be guilty of abusing it Some critics miss the connotation of the phrase, misled by the Latin future perfect gesserit, taking it over-literally (and adding an unwarranted passive) to mean \"it will have been well borne\", an interpretation which is not well supported by the Bene Gesserit doctrine in the story [42] [original research?]\n\n\nEnvironmentalism and ecology\nDune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\" [46] Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\" [47] It was reviewed in the best selling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community\" [48]\n\n\nDeclining empires\nThe Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and the Near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and Ottoman Empire [52] [33] [53] Lorenzo DiTommaso compared Dune's portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome In \"The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction\" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\" The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent Gibbon's Decline and Fall partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others [54]\n\n\nGender dynamics\nGender dynamics are complex in Dune Herbert offers a multi-layered portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical society, particularly through the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood Although the Bene Gesserit tend to hold roles that are traditionally associated with women, such as wives, concubines, and mothers, their characters transcend stereotypes as they play politics and pursue long-term strategic goals Full gender equality is not depicted in Dune, but the Bene Gesserit use specialized training and access to high-ranking men to gain agency and power within the constraints of their environment Their training in prana-bindu allows them to exert control over their minds and bodies, including over pregnancy, and they are skilled in hand-to-hand combat and use of the Voice to command others Jessica's disobedience in bearing a son instead of daughter and training him in the Bene Gesserit Way is a major plot point that sets in motion the events of the novel [57] [58] By setting up certain women with leaders of certain Houses in the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit can control bloodlines across generations through their secret breeding program [59] Even within the male-dominated Imperium, then, the Bene Gesserit wield reproductive power and choose which genetic markers to continue into the future [60]\n\n\nHeroism\nI am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.\n\nZen and religion\nEarly in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to Zen by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\" [74] Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on  [Herbert's] work\" [74] Throughout the Dune series and particularly in Dune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism [74] [75] The Fremen are referred to as Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited [76] In \"Dune Genesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:\n\n\nAsimov's Foundation\nTim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series In his monograph on Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that \"Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation trilogy Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions The twist he has introduced into Dune is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.\" [79] According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science [79] In contrast to the Foundation series and its praise of science and rationality, Dune proposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity [79]\n\n\nCritical reception\nDune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 [82] and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel [83] Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written [84] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies [85] Dune has been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels [86] [3]\n\n\nFirst edition prints and manuscripts\nThe first edition of Dune is one of the most valuable in science fiction book collecting Copies have been sold for more than $20,000 at auction [94]\n\n\nSequels and prequels\nAfter Dune proved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writing Dune [14] The series included Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative from Dune Herbert died on February 11, 1986 [96]\n\n\nAdaptations\nDune has been considered an \"unfilmable\" and \"uncontainable\" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium [98] Described by Wired, \"It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.\" [99] There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success [100]\n\n\nEarly stalled attempts\nIn 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by Arthur P Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was delayed for another year Jacobs' first choice for director was David Lean, but he turned down the offer Charles Jarrott was also considered to direct Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued Initially, the first treatment had been handled by Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974 However, Jacobs died in 1973 [101]\n\n\n1984 film by David Lynch\nIn 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels (written and unwritten) After seeing The Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughter Raffaella decided that David Lynch should direct the movie Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, including Return of the Jedi He agreed to direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction [108] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline [109] Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage [110]\n\n\n2000 miniseries by John Harrison\nIn 2000, John Harrison adapted the novel into Frank Herbert's Dune, a miniseries that premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel [17] As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel [116]\n\n\nFurther film attempts\nIn 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct [117] Producer Kevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci-Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina [117] The producers stated that they were going for a \"faithful adaptation\" of the novel and considered \"its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely\" [117] Science fiction author Kevin J Anderson and Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert, who had together written multiple Dune sequels and prequels since 1999, were attached to the project as technical advisors [118] In October 2009, Berg dropped out of the project, later saying that it \"for a variety of reasons wasn't the right thing\" for him [119] Subsequently, with a script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new director who could do the film for under $175 million [120] In 2010, Pierre Morel was signed on to direct, with screenwriter Chase Palmer incorporating Morel's vision of the project into Zetumer's original draft [121] [122] By November 2010, Morel left the project [123] Paramount finally dropped plans for a remake in March 2011 [124]\n\n\nFilms by Denis Villeneuve\nIn

{"title": "Amr_ibn_Ma'adi_Yakrib", "content": "\nBiography\nAt the time of Muhammad, the Zubaidi clan of the Qahtanite tribal confederation had split into two groups, which were called Zubaid al-Kabir (Zubaid the greater) and Zubaid al-Asgar (Zubaid the lesser) The Zubaid al-Asgar traced their progeny from a sub branch of the Banu Asam clan [1] [2] Amr hailed from the Zubaid al-Asgar subdivision, [3]  and his father, Maʻadī Yakrib ibn Abd Allah, was the clan chieftain [4] Amr is considered by modern historians to be born 75 years before the Hijri year [5] Amr had a sister named Rayhanah, [6] and a brother named Abd, who was killed by a Yemenite Madhhij tribe which came from a different branch of the Zubaidi clan [7]\n\n\nPre-Islamic battles\nAs Amr lived to a great age spanning from before the advent of Islam, he participated in many battles [11] His career of raids and battles that filled most of his pre-Islamic lifetime were recorded with varying levels of accountability [12] Yemeni Mu'tazilite scholar Nashwan ibn Sa'id Al-Hamiri has said that Amr ibn Ma'adi Yakrib reached mythical reputation in pre-Islamic or Jahiliyyah chronicles As indicated from ancient poems, it was recorded that Amr had defeated and captured many pre-Islamic Arabian legendary warriors such as Amir ibn al-Tufail, the chieftain of the Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah tribe, Harith ibn Zalim al-Mari'i  [ar], Abbas ibn Mirdas  [ar], Antarah ibn Shaddad and Durayd ibn Summah al-Jashimi [13] [14] Some legendary traditional stories also depicted Amr's extraordinary feat of encountering two lionesses and killing both in the same fight [15]\n\n\nList of Amr's other battles\nThere is mention of Amr's involvement in long dramatical events of the Aksumite–Persian wars These occurred as the Yemeni Arab tribes coalitions resented the Axumite rule, which prompted the Yemeni to form a coalition through their leader, Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan, with the Sasanian Empire [46] According to Tabari, the undermanned Yemeni-Sasanian alliance won a \"miraculous\" victory, [48] and expelled the Aksumites from the Arabian peninsula [49] [50] [51] After the death of Sayf during the second invasion of Aksumite, Amr was mentioned as one of the tribal chiefs who agreed to support the resistance against the Aksumite, and later agreed to fight under command of Badhan against the Aksumites, which successfully repulsed the Aksumites permanently Yemen then Sasanian Yemen, a Sasanian protectorate region [46]\n\n\nSassanid Yemen\nThere is mention of Amr's involvement in long dramatical events of the Aksumite–Persian wars These occurred as the Yemeni Arab tribes coalitions resented the Axumite rule, which prompted the Yemeni to form a coalition through their leader, Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan, with the Sasanian Empire [46] According to Tabari, the undermanned Yemeni-Sasanian alliance won a \"miraculous\" victory, [48] and expelled the Aksumites from the Arabian peninsula [49] [50] [51] After the death of Sayf during the second invasion of Aksumite, Amr was mentioned as one of the tribal chiefs who agreed to support the resistance against the Aksumite, and later agreed to fight under command of Badhan against the Aksumites, which successfully repulsed the Aksumites permanently Yemen then Sasanian Yemen, a Sasanian protectorate region [46]\n\n\nConversion to Islam & rebellion\nThe Quraysh tribe, from which Muhammad hailed, and the Meccan Qurayshite, hired Amr and Tulayha, another famed pre-Islamic knight hailed from Asad tribe, in some of their battles against opposing tribes, [53] During Muhammad's life, Amr was said to be entangled in an affair which involved his long time rival Amir ibn Tufail, who had once captured Amr and married Amr's sister Raihanah [23] Amir ibn Tufail was captured by Untairah, a female warrior sister of prominent figure named Dhu al-Kalab [23] However, due to intercession from Amr, Untairah agreed to release Amir, who decided then to attack Muhammad, a Meccan Qurayshite who was preaching Islam [23] It is said before he began his attack, Amir ibn Tufail died from a neck tumour, placed there due to the prayers of Muhammad against him [23]\n\n\nMuslim conquest of Levant\nAccording to Yemeni historian professor Sulaiman Issa, Amr brought along Zubaidi tribesmen from Tihamah to participate in the Muslim conquest of the Levant [65] In 634 CE, According to Hisham ibn al-Kalbi, after Khalid ibn Sa'id fell in the battle of Marj al-Saffar, the sword of al-Samsara previously belonging to Amr was found next to his body [56] Mu'awiyah therefore took the sword [56]\n\n\nSiege of Damascus\nLater, Amr participated in the Siege of Damascus, where his arrival alongside Abu Sufyan ibn Harb caused rejoicing amongst the Rashidun soldiers [66] [67] At one point, Thomas, the garrison commander of Damascus, decided to lead the breakthrough against the siege by assembling forces in the eastern gate more numerous than the other gates, so that Khalid would be unable to move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector [68] Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success was achieved in any sector other than the gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough [68] As the East Gate, the situation also became serious, for a larger Byzantine force had been assigned to this sector, and Rafay ibn Umayr was unable to withstand their attacks [69] Only the timely arrival of Khalid with his 400 veteran cavalry and his subsequent attack on the Roman flank, marked the turning point in the sally at the Eastern Gate [69] Amr and Khalid then positioned themselves on the front of the eastern gate of Damascus [70]\n\n\nCampaign in Emesa province\nLater, Amr was involved in the Siege of Emesa in 636 CE along with Kindite tribe soldiers, where he marched to rendezvous with Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, who had recently pacified Jerusalem [70] At first, a Byzantine commander from Baalbek named Harbees was sent to Homs in response to the Muslims' siege of the city [71] Then, as Harbees led a sally in an attempt to break the encirclement, they immediately collided with patrolling troops of Rashidun led by Amr, Dhiraar ibn al-Azwar, Abdul Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, Rabia ibn Amr, and Malik Al-Ashtar [72] [71] The forces of Harbees were swiftly demolished by the Rashidun troops of Amr, which caused the city of Emesa to be captured quickly as there were no more adequate defenders left [71] Amr and Dhiraar then continued by leading more than 5,000 cavalry troops joining Maysarah ibn Masruq to besiege Homs [73]\n\n\nBattle of Yarmuk\nLater, Amr ibn Ma'adi-Yakrib was recorded as participating in the Battle of the Yarmuk, where Amr led soldiers from the Zubaid clan on the right flank of the Rashidun army [5] Amr fought bravely in Yarmuk as he once fought a groups of enemy soldiers whom he slayed one by one, causing the remaining soldiers to retreat until they stopped in one of the Byzantine encampments in the rear of the battle [Notes 3] However, Amr lost one of his eyes during this battle [5] [Notes 4] It is said that he lost one of his eyes due to smallpox [79]\n\n\nMuslim conquest of Persia\nKhuzestan\n\n\nBattle of al-Qadisiyah\nAfter arriving in Qadisiyyah, Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas, the supreme commander of Rashidun army in Iraq, and the Rashidun army in Iraq were rejoiced with the arrival of both Amr and Tulayha, as they were acknowledged by the Qurayshite as heroes who were often hired by the Quraysh tribe to fight their wars in the past, during the era of Pre-Islamic Arabia [citation needed] Amr was then sent by Sa'ad as an envoy to Rostam to give the Sassanids a message, offering Rostam a choice between converting to Islam, surrender and paying Jizya tribute, or war [84] Abu Ubaidah testified in one narration that Amr had reached the age of one hundred and six years old while he attended al-Qadisiyah [35]\n\n\nPre-battle scouting\nLater Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas sent Amr, Tulayha, and group of Rashidun scouts through the enemy territory to gather information [53] After two days of journeying, the scouts spotted the vanguard of Rostam's army which they estimated to be numbered around 70,000 Tulayha and Ibn Ma'adi then sent the scouts to report their findings to Sa'ad, while Tulayha and Ibn Ma'adi continued to gather intel by themselves [53] Then, Tulayha and Ibn Ma'adi managed to trace the second and the third wave which they believed to be the centre and rear of the army, numbered 100,000 and 70,000 respectively [53] Amr urged to Tulayha to return as they had achieved their mission to spot the enemy army, but Tulayha said to wait for one more day, as Tulayha carried out a one-man raid during the night Tulayha infiltrated inside the rear encampment where Rostam's tent was located [53] [85] Tabari particularly detailed in one chain of narrations the circumstances in which Tulayha infiltrated the Sassanid camps under the cover of darkness, and cut the ropes of the Sassanid rear army tents while bringing torches to ignite the fires within the camp [53] Tulayha singlehandedly wrought havoc in their camps, killing two Sassanid soldiers, As the confused Sassanid army plunged into chaos, Tulayha stole two horses and then brought back one captive to Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas [86] [Notes 5] [89]\n\n\nFour days of battles\nLater, as the battle of Qadisiyyah started, the Rashidun cavalry collided with the Sassanid cavalry [84] Then, as the intense battles were ongoing between Rashidun horsemen and Sassanid horsemen, suddenly one of the Sassanid champions challenging Amr to a duel or Mard o mard [84] Amr agreed and fought the Sassanid, only for Amr to seize his neck, slamming him to the ground and killing him Amr remarked an insult that \"the Persians were  [stupid, like a] goat, once they drop their bows\" [84] On another occasion, as Amr roamed between the Rashidun and Sassanid lines on his horse, a Sassanid archer took position in the frontline and shot at Amr, which barely missed, hitting the edge of a bow slung on Amr's shoulder [84] Amr responded by rushing towards the Sassanid archer, dragging him down from his horse, seizing and breaking his neck, then slit his throat with his sword, and dragging the lifeless body of the Sassanid archer to the Muslim ranks and throwing it in front of them, as a gesture to encourage the Muslims to fight harder like he did [84] [90]\n\n\nBattle of Jalula\nLater, Amr participated in the battle of Jalula, where he was reported to have played an important role during this battle along with al-Qa'qa, Tulayha, Hijr ibn 'Adi, and Qays ibn Maksuh [101] According to Baladhuri, Amr was appointed as commander of Rashidun cavalry during this battle [102] At night, Al-Qa'qa brought a number of elite cavalry to reach the door of the ditch [53] Among these horsemen were veterans such as Amr, Tulayha, Qays ibn Maksuh and Hijr ibn Adi, along with several horsemen from the Zubaydi clan [53]\n\n\nFurther conquest of Persia & upper Mesopotamia\nLater, after the establishment of Kufa garrison city, Amr was among notable members of the Madhhij clan who settled in Kufa [104] During the tenure of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas as governor in Kufa, there were scandalous accusations regarding Sa'd's unjust rule in Iraq, to which Umar responded by sending his agents to check and interview the populace in Kufa Sa'd himself was called to Medina for interrogation [105] When Amr was interviewed, Amr testified in defence of Sa'd against the complaints and accusation of the Sa'd duty in Kufa, as according to Amr, the rule of Sa'd was \"...just in law, caring the poors, humble in nature, and fair when giving rewards...\" [105] During Mujashi ibn Mas'ud al-Sulami governance of Basra, Mujashi bestowed upon Amr an Asian sword of al-Qala'i, a slave who could cook bread, ten thousand Dirham, and a foal mare with preserved pedigree from an al-Ghabra horse (dust colored type of Arabian horse) [57] It is noted by Cordoban writer Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih in his anthology, the Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd, that Mujashi belonged to Banu Sulaym, a tribe which was a mortal enemy of the Zubadi The Sulaim had also engaged in many battles against Amr in the past [106] However, Mujashi did not bear ill will towards Amr, and instead recognized his bravery [106] Mujashi also provided Amr with shields, swords, and another warfare equipment [106]\n\n\nBattle of Nahavand & Death\nOn the eve of the battle of Nahāvand, the caliphate heard that the Sassanid armed forces from Mah, Qom, Hamadan, Ray, Isfahan, Azerbaijan, and Nahavand had gathered in the area of Nahavand to counter the caliphate's invasion [110] Caliph Umar responded by assembling war councils to discuss the strategy to face the Sassanids in Nahavand [111] As the battle plans has been set, at first the caliph wanted to lead the army himself, however, Ali urged the caliph to instead delegate the battlefield commands to the field commanders Umar agreed, and decided to send Amr, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Tulayha, Abdullah ibn Amr, Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays and others under the command of Al-Nu'man ibn Muqrin as reinforcements to Nahavand [112] As they arrived in Nahavand, Amr was sent as a scout to gather information about the enemy forces before the battle [113] Amr travelled for three days, exploring the fields around the area in Nahavand, to gather information regarding the enemy strength [114]\n\n\nPersonal characteristic\nAmr was known for his impressive physical build It was said that Amr was so tall and huge in stature, that his feet touched the ground when he rode a horse, [5] Caliph Umar also praised Amr's impressive physical build, declaring that Amr was \"one of God's finest creation\" for the perfection of his musculature and posture [122] As a huge person, Amr also reportedly possessed a huge appetite, as he admitted that when eating a full dish of camel meat, he would consume the camel's meat up to its bones, and he also drank huge amounts of milk [123] The size of his appetite was once recorded during a visit to caliph Umar's residence, where he was treated with large amounts of dishes such as breads and raisins, which still did not appease him until there was no more to give, prompting the caliph to say that he has no more food in the house [44]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmr was a powerful warrior, proficient in swords, armor, shield, bows and arrows [128] [129] While discussing the martial art of weapon usage with Caliph Umar, it is implied that Amr utilised the Tahtib martial art which involved the mastery use of sticks or spear [130] The swords belonging to Amr became a source of various legends and myths in later eras, as Abbasid caliphs were known to possess a famous sword of Amr's, after it has been purchased by the first Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah [131] These fuelled the martial legends surrounding Amr, and were represented by heroic literature and poetry about Amr [132] However, some of the epic deeds of Amr were sometimes incorrectly attributed to another figure named Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan [132]\n\n\nIslam\nIn Islamic belief, Amr is remembered and included as one of the Companions of the Prophet His status as a companion was attested by the record of Ibn Hajar [140] As a companion of Muhammad who served with distinction during the Early Muslim conquests, Muslim scholars of later generations have worked on the memorials and biographical record about Amr ibn Ma'dikarib service during his later half of his life, and his martyrdom during the battle for Islam conquest [141]\n\n\nInterpretations & jurisprudences\nAside from his military service to Islam, Amr also passed down a Hadith, which reported that he heard the recitation of Talbiyah during hajj pilgrimage ritual, taught to him by Muhammad [63] The text reads: \n\n\nPoetries\nWerner Daum noted that Amr was probably the most famous and legendary of the ancient Arab heroes, who roamed the land seeking honour in glorious battles and through poetry [151]\n\n\nDescendants\nMany Arab tribes descend from Amr, including Al-Obaid and Al-Dulaim Most of Amr's descendants are found residing in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria Their numbers have been estimated to exceed 20 million [160]\n\n\nReferences\nZubaidi clan genealogy\n\n\nNotes\nZubaidi clan genealogy\n\n\nInline citations\nZubaidi clan

Yakrib was a renowned Arab warrior, companion of the Prophet Muhammad, and a key figure in the early Muslim conquests. Born in the pre-Islamic era, Amr lived a long and eventful life, participating in numerous battles and campaigns that shaped the course of history. This article will delve into the life and legacy of Amr ibn Ma'adi Yakrib, exploring his early life, military career, and contributions to the spread of Islam.\n\n**Biography**\n\nAmr hailed from the Zubaidi clan of the Qahtanite tribal confederation, which had split into two groups: Zubaid al-Kabir (Zubaid the greater) and Zubaid al-Asgar (Zubaid the lesser).

Yemeni historian professor Sulaiman Issa, Amr brought along Zubaidi tribesmen from Tihamah to participate in the Muslim conquest of the Levant [65] In 634 CE, According to Hisham ibn al-Kalbi, after Khalid ibn Sa'id fell in the battle of Marj al-Saffar, the sword of al-Samsara previously belonging to Amr was found next to his body [56] Mu'awiyah therefore took the sword [56]\n\n\nSiege of Damascus\nLater, Amr participated in the Siege of Damascus, where his arrival alongside Abu Sufyan ibn Harb caused rejoicing amongst the Rashidun soldiers [66] [67] At one point, Thomas, the garrison commander of Damascus, decided to lead the breakthrough against the siege by assembling forces in the eastern gate more numerous than the other gates, so that Khalid would be unable to move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector [68] Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success was achieved in any sector other than the gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough [68] As the East Gate, the situation also became serious, for a larger Byzantine force had been assigned to this sector, and Rafay ibn Umayr was unable to withstand their attacks [69] Only the timely arrival of Khalid with his 400 veteran cavalry and his subsequent attack on the Roman flank, marked the turning point in the sally at the Eastern Gate [69] Amr and Khalid then positioned themselves on the front of the eastern gate of Damascus [70]\n\n\nCampaign in Emesa province\nLater, Amr was involved in the Siege of Emesa in 636 CE along with Kindite tribe soldiers, where he marched to rendezvous with Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, who had recently pacified Jerusalem [70] At first, a Byzantine commander from Baalbek named Harbees was sent to Homs in response to the Muslims' siege of the city [71] Then, as Harbees led a sally in an attempt to break the encirclement, they immediately collided with patrolling troops of Rashidun led by Amr, Dhiraar ibn al-Azwar, Abdul Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, Rabia ibn Amr, and Malik Al-Ashtar [72] [71] The forces of Harbees were swiftly demolished by the Rashidun troops of Amr, which caused the city of Emesa to be captured quickly as there were no more adequate defenders left [71] Amr and Dhiraar then continued by leading more than 5,000 cavalry troops joining Maysarah ibn Masruq to besiege Homs [73]\n\n\nBattle of Yarmuk\nLater, Amr ibn Ma'adi-Yakrib was recorded as participating in the Battle of the Yarmuk, where Amr led soldiers from the Zubaid clan on the right flank of the Rashidun army [5] Amr fought bravely in Yarmuk as he once fought a groups of enemy soldiers whom he slayed one by one, causing the remaining soldiers to retreat until they stopped in one of the Byzantine encampments in the rear of the battle [Notes 3] However, Amr lost one of his eyes during this battle [5] [Notes 4] It is said that he lost one of his eyes due to smallpox [79]\n\n\nMuslim conquest of Persia\nKhuzestan\n\n\nBattle of al-Qadisiyah\nAfter arriving in Qadisiyyah, Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas, the supreme commander of Rashidun army in Iraq, and the Rashidun army in Iraq were rejoiced with the arrival of both Amr and Tulayha, as they were acknowledged by the Qurayshite as heroes who were often hired by the Quraysh tribe to fight their wars in the past, during the era of Pre-Islamic Arabia [citation needed] Amr was then sent by Sa'ad as an envoy to Rostam to give the Sassanids a message, offering Rostam a choice between converting to Islam, surrender and paying Jizya tribute, or war [84] Abu Ubaidah testified in one narration that Amr had reached the age of one hundred and six years old while he attended al-Qadisiyah [35]\n\n\nPre-battle scouting\nLater Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas sent Amr, Tulayha, and group of Rashidun scouts through the enemy territory to gather information [53] After two days of journeying, the scouts spotted the vanguard of Rostam's army which they estimated to be numbered around 70,000 Tulayha and Ibn Ma'adi then sent the scouts to report their findings to Sa'ad, while Tulayha and Ibn Ma'adi continued to gather intel by themselves [53] Then, Tulayha and Ibn Ma'adi managed to trace the second and the third wave which they believed to be the centre and rear of the army, numbered 100,000 and 70,000 respectively [53] Amr urged to Tulayha to return as they had achieved their mission to spot the enemy army, but Tulayha said to wait for one more day, as Tulayha carried out a one-man raid during the night Tulayha infiltrated inside the rear encampment where Rostam's tent was located [53] [85] Tabari particularly detailed in one chain of narrations the circumstances in which Tulayha infiltrated the Sassanid camps under the cover of darkness, and cut the ropes of the Sassanid rear army tents while bringing torches to ignite the fires within the camp [53] Tulayha singlehandedly wrought havoc in their camps, killing two Sassanid soldiers, As the confused Sassanid army plunged into chaos, Tulayha stole two horses and then brought back one captive to Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas [86] [Notes 5] [89]\n\n\nFour days of battles\nLater, as the battle of Qadisiyyah started, the Rashidun cavalry collided with the Sassanid cavalry [84] Then, as the intense battles were ongoing between Rashidun horsemen and Sassanid horsemen, suddenly one of the Sassanid champions challenging Amr to a duel or Mard o mard [84] Amr agreed and fought the Sassanid, only for Amr to seize his neck, slamming him to the ground and killing him Amr remarked an insult that \"the Persians were  [stupid, like a] goat, once they drop their bows\" [84] On another occasion, as Amr roamed between the Rashidun and Sassanid lines on his horse, a Sassanid archer took position in the frontline and shot at Amr, which barely missed, hitting the edge of a bow slung on Amr's shoulder [84] Amr responded by rushing towards the Sassanid archer, dragging him down from his horse, seizing and breaking his neck, then slit his throat with his sword, and dragging the lifeless body of the Sassanid archer to the Muslim ranks and throwing it in front of them, as a gesture to encourage the Muslims to fight harder like he did [84] [90]\n\n\nBattle of Jalula\nLater, Amr participated in the battle of Jalula, where he was reported to have played an important role during this battle along with al-Qa'qa, Tulayha, Hijr ibn 'Adi, and Qays ibn Maksuh [101] According to Baladhuri, Amr was appointed as commander of Rashidun cavalry during this battle [102] At night, Al-Qa'qa brought a number of elite cavalry to reach the door of the ditch [53] Among these horsemen were veterans such as Amr, Tulayha, Qays ibn Maksuh and Hijr ibn Adi, along with several horsemen from the Zubaydi clan [53]\n\n\nFurther conquest of Persia & upper Mesopotamia\nLater, after the establishment of Kufa garrison city, Amr was among notable members of the Madhhij clan who settled in Kufa [104] During the tenure of Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas as governor in Kufa, there were scandalous accusations regarding Sa'd's unjust rule in Iraq, to which Umar responded by sending his agents to check and interview the populace in Kufa Sa'd himself was called to Medina for interrogation [105] When Amr was interviewed, Amr testified in defence of Sa'd against the complaints and accusation of the Sa'd duty in Kufa, as according to Amr, the rule of Sa'd was \"...just in law, caring the poors, humble in nature, and fair when giving rewards...\" [105] During Mujashi ibn Mas'ud al-Sulami governance of Basra, Mujashi bestowed upon Amr an Asian sword of al-Qala'i, a slave who could cook bread, ten thousand Dirham, and a foal mare with preserved pedigree from an al-Ghabra horse (dust colored type of Arabian horse) [57] It is noted by Cordoban writer Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih in his anthology, the Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd, that Mujashi belonged to Banu Sulaym, a tribe which was a mortal enemy of the Zubadi The Sulaim had also engaged in many battles against Amr in the past [106] However, Mujashi did not bear ill will towards Amr, and instead recognized his bravery [106] Mujashi also provided Amr with shields, swords, and another warfare equipment [106]\n\n\nBattle of Nahavand & Death\nOn the eve of the battle of Nahāvand, the caliphate heard that the Sassanid armed forces from Mah, Qom, Hamadan, Ray, Isfahan, Azerbaijan, and Nahavand had gathered in the area of Nahavand to counter the caliphate's invasion [110] Caliph Umar responded by assembling war councils to discuss the strategy to face the Sassanids in Nahavand [111] As the battle plans has been set, at first the caliph wanted to lead the army himself, however, Ali urged the caliph to instead delegate the battlefield commands to the field commanders Umar agreed, and decided to send Amr, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Tulayha, Abdullah ibn Amr, Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays and others under the command of Al-Nu'man ibn Muqrin as reinforcements to Nahavand [112] As they arrived in Nahavand, Amr was sent as a scout to gather information about the enemy forces before the battle [113] Amr travelled for three days, exploring the fields around the area in Nahavand, to gather information regarding the enemy strength [114]\n\n\nPersonal characteristic\nAmr was known for his impressive physical build It was said that Amr was so tall and huge in stature, that his feet touched the ground when he rode a horse, [5] Caliph Umar also praised Amr's impressive physical build, declaring that Amr was \"one of God's finest creation\" for the perfection of his musculature and posture [122] As a huge person, Amr also reportedly possessed a huge appetite, as he admitted that when eating a full dish of camel meat, he would consume the camel's meat up to its bones, and he also drank huge amounts of milk [123] The size of his appetite was once recorded during a visit to caliph Umar's residence, where he was treated with large amounts of dishes such as breads and raisins, which still did not appease him until there was no more to give, prompting the caliph to say that he has no more food in the house [44]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmr was a powerful warrior, proficient in swords, armor, shield, bows and arrows [128] [129] While discussing the martial art of weapon usage with Caliph Umar, it is implied that Amr utilised the Tahtib martial art which involved the mastery use of sticks or spear [130] The swords belonging to Amr became a source of various legends and myths in later eras, as Abbasid caliphs were known to possess a famous sword of Amr's, after it has been purchased by the first Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah [131] These fuelled the martial legends surrounding Amr, and were represented by heroic literature and poetry about Amr [132] However, some of the epic deeds of Amr were sometimes incorrectly attributed to another figure named Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan [132]\n\n\nIslam\nIn Islamic belief, Amr is remembered and included as one of the Companions of the Prophet His status as a companion was attested by the record of Ibn Hajar [140] As a companion of Muhammad who served with distinction during the Early Muslim conquests, Muslim scholars of later generations have worked on the memorials and biographical record about Amr ibn Ma'dikarib service during his later half of his life, and his martyrdom during the battle for Islam conquest [141]\n\n\nInterpretations & jurisprudences\nAside from his military service to Islam, Amr also passed down a Hadith, which reported that he heard the recitation of Talbiyah during hajj pilgrimage ritual, taught to him by Muhammad [63] The text reads: \n\n\nPoetries\nWerner Daum noted that Amr was probably the most famous and legendary of the ancient Arab heroes, who roamed the land seeking honour in glorious battles and through poetry [151]\n\n\nDescendants\nMany Arab tribes descend from Amr, including Al-Obaid and Al-Dulaim Most of Amr's descendants are found residing in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria Their numbers have been estimated to exceed 20 million

The idea is that these seven vices, when indulged in, can lead to spiritual and moral downfall, and are considered the fundamental opposites of the seven virtues. In this article, we will explore the history and development of the seven deadly sins, their definitions, associations, and historical context.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe concept of virtues and vices has been present in ancient cultures, with Roman writers such as Horace extolling virtues and warning against vices. In his first epistles, Horace writes that \"to flee vice is the beginning of virtue and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom.\" This idea of a clear distinction between good and evil, virtue and vice, has been a cornerstone of Western moral philosophy.\n\nGreco-Roman Antecedents\n-------------------------\n\nThe concept of the seven deadly sins has its roots in the Greco-Roman world, where philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato discussed the nature of vice and virtue. The Greek concept of the seven virtues, for example, included justice, temperance, prudence, courage, wisdom, and piety. These virtues were seen as necessary for living a good life and achieving happiness.\n\nOrigin of the Currently Recognized Seven Deadly Sins\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe modern concept of the seven deadly sins, however, is credited to the Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas, who listed the seven vices as follows:\n\n1. Pride (Latin: Superbia)\n2. Envy (Latin: Invidia)\n3. Wrath (Latin: Ira)\n4. Sloth (Latin: Acedia)\n5. Greed (Latin: Avaritia)\n6. Gluttony (Latin: Gula)\n7. Lust (Latin: Luxuria)\n\nHistorical and Modern Definitions, Views, and Associations\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe seven deadly sins have been interpreted and reinterpreted over the centuries, with varying degrees of emphasis on their meaning and significance. According to Catholic prelate Henry Edward Manning, the seven deadly sins are seven ways of eternal death. The Lutheran divine Martin Chemnitz, who contributed to the development of Lutheran systematic theology, implored clergy to remind the faithful of the seven deadly sins.\n\nLust\n----\n\nLust, or lechery, is intense longing, usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire. It may lead to fornication (including adultery), rape, bestiality, and other sinful and sexual acts. However, it can also mean other forms of unbridled desire, such as for money or power. Henry Edward Manning explains that the impurity of lust transforms one into \"a slave of the devil.\"\n\nGluttony\n--------\n\nGluttony is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste. The word derives from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow. One reason for its condemnation is that the gorging of the prosperous may leave the needy hungry.\n\nGreed\n-----\n\nIn the words of Henry Edward Manning, avarice \"plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god.\" Greed is characterized by an insatiable desire for wealth, material possessions, and power.\n\nSloth\n-----\n\nSloth refers to many related ideas, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states. It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion.\n\nWrath\n-----\n\nWrath can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance.\n\nEnvy\n----\n\nEnvy is characterized by an insatiable desire like greed and lust. It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else. It comes from vainglory and severs a man from his neighbor.\n\nPride\n-----\n\nPride, also known as hubris (from Ancient Greek ὕβρις) or futility, is considered the original and worst of the seven deadly sins on almost every list. It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins. Pride is the opposite of humility.\n\nHistorical Sins\n----------------\n\nAcedia\n-------\n\nAcedia is the neglect to take care of something that one should do. It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy. It is related to melancholy; acedia describes the behavior and melancholy suggests the emotion producing it. In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God. By contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in times of need.\n\nVainglory\n---------\n\nVainglory is unjustified boasting. Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded vainglory into pride for his listing of sins. According to Aquinas, it is the progenitor of envy.\n\nConfession Patterns\n-------------------\n\nAccording to a 2009 study, the most common deadly sin confessed by men is lust, and the most common deadly sin confessed by women is pride. It was unclear whether these differences were due to the actual number of transgressions committed by each sex or whether differing views on what \"counts\" or should be confessed caused the observed pattern.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* Capital vices\n* Christian ethics\n* Christian morality\n* Deadly sins in art and literature\n* Greco-Roman mythology\n* List of vices\n* Virtues in Western philosophy", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seven_deadly_sins\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nRoman writers such as Horace extolled virtues, and they listed and warned against vices His first epistles say that \"to flee vice is the beginning of virtue and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom.\" [3]\n\n\nGreco-Roman antecedents\nRoman writers such as Horace extolled virtues, and they listed and warned against vices His first epistles say that \"to flee vice is the beginning of virtue and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom.\" [3]\n\n\nOrigin of the currently recognized seven deadly sins\nThese \"evil thoughts\" can be categorized as follows: [4]\n\n\nHistorical and modern definitions, views, and associations\nAccording to Catholic prelate Henry Edward Manning, the seven deadly sins are seven ways of eternal death [19] The Lutheran divine Martin Chemnitz, who contributed to the development of Lutheran systematic theology, implored clergy to remind the faithful of the seven deadly sins [20]\n\n\nLust\nLust or lechery is intense longing It is usually thought of as intense or unbridled sexual desire, [21] which may lead to fornication (including adultery), rape, bestiality, and other sinful and sexual acts; oftentimes, however, it can also mean other forms of unbridled desire, such as for money, or power Henry Edward Manning explains that the impurity of lust transforms one into \"a slave of the devil\" [19]\n\n\nGluttony\nGluttony is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste The word derives from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow [25] One reason for its condemnation is that the gorging of the prosperous may leave the needy hungry [26]\n\n\nGreed\nIn the words of Henry Edward Manning, avarice \"plunges a man deep into the mire of this world, so that he makes it to be his god\" [19]\n\n\nSloth\nSloth refers to many related ideas, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states [30] It may be defined as absence of interest or habitual disinclination to exertion [31]\n\n\nWrath\nWrath can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance [33]\n\n\nEnvy\nEnvy is characterized by an insatiable desire like greed and lust It can be described as a sad or resentful covetousness towards the traits or possessions of someone else It comes from vainglory [36] and severs a man from his neighbor [19]\n\n\nPride\nPride, also known as hubris (from Ancient Greek ὕβρις) or futility, is considered the original and worst of the seven deadly sins on almost every list, the most demonic [39] It is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins Pride is the opposite of humility [40] [41]\n\n\nHistorical sins\nAcedia is the neglect to take care of something that one should do It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy It is related to melancholy; acedia describes the behaviour and melancholy suggests the emotion producing it In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God By contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in times of need.\n\n\nAcedia\nAcedia is the neglect to take care of something that one should do It is translated to apathetic listlessness; depression without joy It is related to melancholy; acedia describes the behaviour and melancholy suggests the emotion producing it In early Christian thought, the lack of joy was regarded as a willful refusal to enjoy the goodness of God By contrast, apathy was considered a refusal to help others in times of need.\n\n\nVainglory\nVainglory is unjustified boasting Pope Gregory viewed it as a form of pride, so he folded vainglory into pride for his listing of sins [11] According to Aquinas, it is the progenitor of envy [36]\n\n\nConfession patterns\nAccording to a 2009 study by the Jesuit scholar Fr Roberto Busa, the most common deadly sin confessed by men is lust and the most common deadly sin confessed by women is pride [51] It was unclear whether these differences were due to the actual number of transgressions committed by each sex or whether differing views on what \"counts\" or should be confessed caused the observed pattern [52]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Throughout her distinguished career, Didion has been celebrated for her unique writing style, which blends elements of journalism, fiction, and memoir to create a distinctive and captivating narrative voice.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJoan Didion was born on December 5, 1934, in Sacramento, California, to Eduene (née Jerrett) and Frank Reese Didion. She had one brother, five years her junior, James Jerrett Didion, who became a real estate executive. Didion recalled writing things down as early as age five, although she said she never saw herself as a writer until after her work had been published. As a shy and bookish child, Didion found solace in reading and writing, which helped her overcome social anxiety. During her adolescence, she would type out Ernest Hemingway's works to learn how his sentence structures worked.\n\n**Career**\n\nDidion's writing career began in the 1950s, when she worked as a promotional copywriter at Vogue magazine. Over the course of seven years, she worked her way up to associate feature editor, during which time she wrote numerous articles and features for the magazine. In 1960, Mademoiselle published Didion's article \"Berkeley's Giant: The University of California,\" which showcased her talent for capturing the essence of the American experience.\n\nWhile at Vogue, Didion began working on her first novel, Run, River (1963), which tells the story of a Sacramento family as it comes apart. The novel was a critical success, and it marked the beginning of Didion's exploration of the American condition. Writer and friend John Gregory Dunne helped her edit the book, and the two would eventually marry in 1964.\n\n**Slouching Towards Bethlehem**\n\nIn 1968, Didion published her first nonfiction book, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, a collection of magazine pieces about her experiences in California. The book is considered a landmark of New Journalism, a genre that blends elements of journalism and fiction to create a unique narrative voice. Didion's writing in Slouching Towards Bethlehem is characterized by its lyricism, nuance, and irony, which capture the complexities of the American experience.\n\n**1970s**\n\nDidion's novel Play It as It Lays, set in Hollywood, was published in 1970, and A Book of Common Prayer appeared in 1977. In 1979, she published The White Album, another collection of her magazine pieces from Life, Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Times, and The New York Review of Books. The book's title essay documents an episode Didion experienced in the summer of 1968, which she describes as an attack of vertigo and nausea.\n\n**1980s and 1990s**\n\nDidion's book-length essay Salvador (1983) was written after a two-week trip to El Salvador with her husband.

The family journeyed to London by coach, accompanied by eleven other Powhatans including a holy man named Tomocomo.\n\n**Death**\n\nIn March 1617, Rolfe and Pocahontas boarded a ship to return to Virginia, but they had sailed only as far as Gravesend on the River Thames when Pocahontas became gravely ill. She was taken ashore, where she died from unknown causes, aged approximately 21 and \"much lamented.\" According to Rolfe, she declared that \"all must die\"; for her, it was enough that her child lived.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPocahontas and John Rolfe had a son, Thomas Rolfe, born in January 1615. Thomas and his wife, Jane Poythress, had a daughter, Jane Rolfe, who was born in Varina, in present-day Henrico County, Virginia, on October 10, 1650. Jane married Robert Bolling of present-day Prince George County, Virginia. Their son, John Bolling, was born in 1676. John Bolling married Mary Kennon and had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.\n\n**Image Gallery**\n\nAfter her death, increasingly fanciful and romanticized representations were produced about Pocahontas, in which she and Smith are frequently portrayed as romantically involved. Contemporaneous sources substantiate claims of their friendship but not romance. The first claim of their romantic involvement was in John Davis' Travels in the United States of America (1803).\n\n**Cultural Representations**\n\nAfter her death, increasingly fanciful and romanticized representations were produced about Pocahontas, in which she and Smith are frequently portrayed as romantically involved.

she would \"get the boys forth with her into the marketplace and make them wheel, falling on their hands, turning up their heels upwards, whom she would follow and wheel so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over\" [14]\n\n\nTitle and status\nPocahontas is frequently viewed as a princess in popular culture In 1841, William Watson Waldron of Trinity College, Dublin, published Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems, calling her \"the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king\" [17] She was her father's \"delight and darling\", according to colonist Captain Ralph Hamor, [18] but she was not in line to inherit a position as a weroance, sub-chief, or mamanatowick (paramount chief) Instead, Powhatan's brothers and sisters and his sisters' children all stood in line to succeed him [19] In his A Map of Virginia, John Smith explained how matrilineal inheritance worked among the Powhatans:\n\n\nInteractions with the colonists\nPocahontas is most famously linked to colonist John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with 100 other settlers in April 1607 The colonists built a fort on a marshy peninsula on the James River, and had numerous encounters over the next several months with the people of Tsenacommacah – some of them friendly, some hostile.\n\n\nJohn Smith\nPocahontas is most famously linked to colonist John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with 100 other settlers in April 1607 The colonists built a fort on a marshy peninsula on the James River, and had numerous encounters over the next several months with the people of Tsenacommacah – some of them friendly, some hostile.\n\n\nCapture\nPocahontas' capture occurred in the context of the First Anglo-Powhatan War, a conflict between the Jamestown settlers and the Natives which began late in the summer of 1609 [30] In the first years of war, the colonists took control of the James River, both at its mouth and at the falls In the meantime, Captain Samuel Argall pursued contacts with Native tribes in the northern portion of Powhatan's paramount chiefdom The Patawomecks lived on the Potomac River and were not always loyal to Powhatan, and living with them was Henry Spelman, a young English interpreter In March 1613, Argall learned that Pocahontas was visiting the Patawomeck village of Passapatanzy and living under the protection of the weroance Iopassus (also known as Japazaws) [31]\n\n\nPossible first marriage\nMattaponi tradition holds that Pocahontas' first husband was Kocoum, brother of the Patawomeck weroance Japazaws, and that Kocoum was killed by the colonists after his wife's capture in 1613 [37] Today's Patawomecks believe that Pocahontas and Kocoum had a daughter named Ka-Okee who was raised by the Patawomecks after her father's death and her mother's abduction [38]\n\n\nMarriage to John Rolfe\nDuring her stay at Henricus, Pocahontas met John Rolfe Rolfe's English-born wife Sarah Hacker and child Bermuda had died on the way to Virginia after the wreck of the ship Sea Venture on the Summer Isles, now known as Bermuda He established the Virginia plantation Varina Farms, where he cultivated a new strain of tobacco Rolfe was a pious man and agonized over the potential moral repercussions of marrying a heathen, though in fact Pocahontas had accepted the Christian faith and taken the baptismal name Rebecca In a long letter to the governor requesting permission to wed her, he expressed his love for Pocahontas and his belief that he would be saving her soul He wrote that he was:\n\n\nEngland\nOne goal of the London Company was to convert Native Americans to Christianity, and they saw an opportunity to promote further investment with the conversion of Pocahontas and her marriage to Rolfe, all of which also helped end the First Anglo-Powhatan War The company decided to bring Pocahontas to England as a symbol of the tamed New World \"savage\" and the success of the Virginia colony, [47] and the Rolfes arrived at the port of Plymouth on June 12, 1616 [48] The family journeyed to London by coach, accompanied by eleven other Powhatans including a holy man named Tomocomo [49] John Smith was living in London at the time while Pocahontas was in Plymouth, and she learned that he was still alive [50] Smith did not meet Pocahontas, but he wrote to Queen Anne urging that Pocahontas be treated with respect as a royal visitor He suggested that, if she were treated badly, her \"present love to us and Christianity might turn to.. scorn and fury\", and England might lose the chance to \"rightly have a Kingdom by her means\" [7]\n\n\nDeath\nIn March 1617, Rolfe and Pocahontas boarded a ship to return to Virginia, but they had sailed only as far as Gravesend on the River Thames when Pocahontas became gravely ill [55] She was taken ashore, where she died from unknown causes, aged approximately 21 and \"much lamented\" According to Rolfe, she declared that \"all must die\";

{"title": "La_Palma", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe full name of the island is \"San Miguel de La Palma\" (\"Saint Michael of La Palma\"), usually abbreviated simply to \"La Palma\" La Palma is nicknamed \"La Isla Bonita\" (\"beautiful island\") [5]\n\n\nOrigins and geology\nLa Palma, like the other islands of the Canary Islands archipelago, is a volcanic ocean island The volcano rises almost 7 km (4 mi) above the floor of the Atlantic Ocean [6] There is road access from sea level to the summit at 2,426 m (7,959 ft), [7] which is marked by an outcrop of rocks called Roque de Los Muchachos (\"Rock of the Young Men\") This is the site of the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, one of the world's premier astronomical observatories [8]\n\n\nVolcanism and eruptions\nLike all of the Canary Islands, La Palma originally formed as a seamount through submarine volcanic activity Along with Tenerife, La Palma is the most volcanically active of the Canary Islands Its base lies almost 4,000 m (13,123 ft) below sea level and reaches a height of 2,426 m (7,959 ft) above sea level [9] About a half a million years ago, the Taburiente volcano collapsed with a giant landslide, forming the Caldera de Taburiente Erosion has since exposed part of the old seamount in the northern part of the caldera Since the Spanish have kept records, there have been eight eruptions – all of which have occurred on the Cumbre Vieja volcanic ridge: [10]\n\n\nTsunami scenarios\nIn an episode of the BBC Horizon series broadcast on 12 October 2000, two geologists hypothesised that during a future eruption, the western flank of Cumbre Vieja, with a mass of approximately 1.5 x1015 kg, could slide into the ocean This could then generate a giant wave, known as a \"megatsunami\" around 650–900 m (2,130–2,950 ft) high The wave could radiate out across the Atlantic and inundate much of the eastern seaboard of North America, and many of the islands in the Caribbean and northern coasts of South America between six and eight hours later They estimate that such a tsunami could have waves possibly 50 m (164 ft) or higher causing massive devastation along the coastlines Modelling suggests that the tsunami could inundate up to 25 km (16 mi) inland [19] [20] The claim was also explored in a BBC docu-drama called End Day which went through several hypothetical scenarios of disastrous proportions However, nowhere in their papers do the authors make any claim about the imminent collapse of the flank Rather, they state that they have modelled the worst-case scenario.\n\n\nClimate\nLa Palma can be characterized by two main climate types: The Mediterranean climate (Köppen : Csb/Csa), characterized by dry summers and humid winters, is prevalent in the northern coast and in the mid to high altitudes of the island At lower altitudes, particularly at the south and southwest coasts, the climate becomes semi-arid (Köppen : BSh) [27] Average temperatures at the coast vary from 18 °C (64 °F) in January and February to 24 °C (75 °F) in August and September  For a Canary island, the weather is quite cloudy, as La Palma is far more exposed to marine air systems than easterly islands, caused by the Canary Current As altitude increases moving inland, the climate becomes cooler and more humid, which provides conditions for laurisilva cloud forests to occur, such as the one in the Natural Park of Bosque de los Tiles [28]\n\n\nGovernment\nThe island is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe local economy is primarily based on agriculture and tourism Bananas are grown throughout the island with many banana farms on the western side of the island in Los Llanos de Aridane Other crops include bird of paradise flowers, oranges, avocados and grapes Local ranchers raise cattle, sheep and goats Fishermen operating from Santa Cruz de La Palma, Tazacorte, and Puerto Naos catch fish for the local markets.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nLa Palma has abundant plant life, including several endemic species.\n\n\nNatural symbols\nThe official natural symbols associated with La Palma are the red-billed chough (graja) and Pinus canariensis (Canary Island pine) [36]\n\n\nHistory\nAt the time of European colonization, the Canary Islands were inhabited by native Canarians, referred to collectively as Guanches, although the natives of La Palma are more correctly known as Auaritas (See Canary Islands in pre-colonial times) The origin of these natives is unclear but they are believed to share common ancestry with the Berbers of North Africa The Guanches had a Neolithic culture divided into several clans led by chiefs Their name for La Palma was Benahoare The main remnants of this culture are their cave dwellings, enigmatic petroglyphs and paved stone paths through the mountains After the Spanish occupation of La Palma, the native Canarians vanished by either being killed, sold into slavery or by assimilating into the Spanish population.\n\n\nReligion\nThe island is predominately Roman Catholic and since 1676, has been known for the festival of Fiestas Lustrales de la Bajada de la Virgen de las Nieves (the bringing down of the Virgin of the Snow, Virgen de las Nieves), which has a rich history, from the time of the Bishop of the Canaries, Bartolomé García Ximénez The festival features the dancing of \"enanos\" or midgets The costumes that people wear have a hole at the top of the hat to allow them to see out, while giving the appearance of dancing midgets People come from all over the world for the celebration which happens every five years The image of the Virgin is taken down from her sanctuary (located in a hilly area on the outskirts of Santa Cruz de La Palma) and paraded around the city of Santa Cruz with the festival lasting nearly two weeks before she is returned The last time this event was performed in 2015 and the next will be in 2025, as in 2020 had to be cancelled due to the global pandemic of COVID-19.\n\n\nTransport\nLa Palma has a road network of some 1,200 km (746 mi) All the main roads are asphalted and in a good state, although there are many sharp bends, some very narrow In order to reach some small hamlets in the north of the island it is necessary to travel on unpaved roads A good paved road approximately  180 km (112 mi), circumscribes the island Several bus routes exist that unite the main settlements on the island.\n\n\nWater tunnels\nThe minas galerias (water tunnels) carry water from sources in the highlands to towns, villages and farms La Palma receives almost all of its water from the mar de nubes (sea of clouds) of the northeast trade winds The water condenses on the vegetation, from where it runs into the ground Eventually it collects inside the rock strata, and is then drained via the galerias into aqueducts and pipes for distribution The galerias have been cut into the rocks over centuries It is possible to walk alongside many of the aqueducts, a popular activity for tourists (similar to the levadas of Madeira) The tour to the Marcos y Corderos waterfall and springs is also popular.\n\n\nObservatories\nDue to the location of the island and the height of its mountains, some 2,400 m (7,874 ft) above sea level, a number of international astronomical observatories have been built on the Roque de los Muchachos The particular geographical position and climate cause clouds to form between 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and 2,000 m (6,562 ft), usually leaving the observatories with a clear sky Often, the view from the top of the volcano is a sea of clouds covering the eastern part of the island [8] Telescopes at the observatory include:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**La

occupation, and was reaffirmed by the 1993 independence referendum and 1997 constitution [35]\n\n\nHistory\nMadam Buya is the name of a fossil found at an archaeological site in Eritrea by Italian anthropologists She has been identified as among the oldest hominid fossils found to date that reveal significant stages in the evolution of humans and to represent a possible link between the earlier Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens Her remains have been dated to 1 million years old She is the oldest skeletal find of her kind and provides a link between earlier hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans [36] It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was a major site in terms of human evolution and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans [37]\n\n\nPrehistory\nMadam Buya is the name of a fossil found at an archaeological site in Eritrea by Italian anthropologists She has been identified as among the oldest hominid fossils found to date that reveal significant stages in the evolution of humans and to represent a possible link between the earlier Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens Her remains have been dated to 1 million years old She is the oldest skeletal find of her kind and provides a link between earlier hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans [36] It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was a major site in terms of human evolution and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans [37]\n\n\nAntiquity\nResearch shows tools found in the Barka Valley dating from 8,000 BC appear to offer the first concrete evidence of human settlement in the area [43] Research also shows that many of the ethnic groups of Eritrea were the first to inhabit these areas [44]\n\n\nD'mt\nDʿmt was a kingdom that existed from the tenth to fifth centuries BC in what is now Eritrea and northern Ethiopia Given the presence of a massive temple complex at Yeha, this area was most likely the kingdom's capital Qohaito, often identified as the town of Koloe in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, [57] as well as Matara were important ancient Dʿmt kingdom cities in southern Eritrea.\n\n\nKingdom of Aksum\nThe Kingdom of Aksum (or Axum) was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia [59] It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the fourth century BC to achieve prominence by the first century AD.\n\n\nMedri Bahri\nAfter the decline of Aksum, the Eritrean highlands fell under the domain of the Christian Zagwe dynasty, and later, fell under the sphere of influence of the Ethiopian Empire [68] The area was at first known as Ma'ikele Bahri (\"between the seas/rivers\", i.e the land between the Red Sea and the Mereb river) [69] The entire coastal domain of Ma'ikele Bahri was under the Adal Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Badlay ibn Sa'ad ad-Din [70] [71] The state was later reconquered by the Ethiopian Emperor Zara Yaqob who reorganized the administration of the coastal highlands into the Christian province of Midri-Bahri (\"Sea land\" in Tigrinya, although it included some areas such as Shire in Ethiopia on the other side of the Mereb, today in Ethiopia) ruled by a Bahri Negus (or Bahri Negash, meaning \"sea king\") [72] With its capital at Debarwa, [73] the state's main provinces were Hamasien, Serae, and Akele Guzai.\n\n\nItalian Eritrea\nThe boundaries of present-day Eritrea were established during the Scramble for Africa On 15 November 1869, the ruling local chief sold lands surrounding the Bay of Assab to the Italian missionary Giuseppe Sapeto on behalf of the Rubattino Shipping Company [86] The area served as a coaling station along the shipping lanes introduced by the recently completed Suez Canal In 1882, the Italian government formally took possession of the Assab colony from its commercial owners and expanded their control to include Massawa and most of the Eritrean coastal lowlands after the Egyptians withdrew from Eritrea in February 1885 [87]\n\n\nBritish administration\nThrough the 1941 Battle of Keren, the British expelled the Italians and took over the administration of the country [95] Economically, the decade of British administration saw a significant restructuring of the Eritrean economy Until 1945, the British and Americans relied on Italian equipment and skilled labor for wartime needs and to support the Allies in the Middle East This economic boom, fueled by substantial Italian involvement, lasted until the end of the war However, shortly after the conflict concluded, the Eritrean economy faced a combination of recession and depression that severely impacted the local urban population War factories that had employed thousands were shut down, and Italians began to be repatriated Additionally, many small manufacturing plants established between 1936 and 1945 were forced to close due to intense competition from factories in Europe and the Middle East [96]\n\n\nAnnexation by Ethiopia\nIn the 1950s, the Ethiopian feudal administration under Emperor Haile Selassie sought to annex Eritrea and Italian Somaliland He laid claim to both territories in a letter to Franklin D Roosevelt at the Paris Peace Conference and the First Session of the United Nations [98] In the United Nations, the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued The British and Americans preferred to cede all of Eritrea except the Western province to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during World War II [99] The Independence Bloc of Eritrean parties consistently requested from the United Nations General Assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the Eritrean question of sovereignty.\n\n\nIndependence\nIn 1958, a group of Eritreans founded the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM) The organization mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals, and intellectuals It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state [101] On 1 September 1961, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), under the leadership of Hamid Idris Awate, waged an armed struggle for independence In 1962, Emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and annexed the territory The ensuing Eritrean War of Independence went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), a successor of the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of Ethiopian rebel forces take control of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.\n\n\nGeography\nEritrea is located in East Africa It is bordered to the northeast and east by the Red Sea, Sudan to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Djibouti to the southeast Eritrea lies between latitudes 12° and 18°N, and longitudes 36° and 44°E.\n\n\nClimate\nBased on temperature variations, Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: the temperate zone, subtropical climate zone, and tropical climate zone [116]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nEritrea has several species of mammals and a rich avifauna of 560 species of birds [120]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) is the only legal party in Eritrea [133] Other political groups are not allowed to organize, although the unimplemented Constitution of 1997 provides for the existence of multi-party politics The National Assembly has 150 seats National elections have been periodically scheduled and cancelled; as of 2022, none have ever been held in the country [28] President Isaias Afwerki has been in office since independence in 1993.\n\n\nNational, regional, and local elections\nGiven that the full implementation of the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Eritrea and Ethiopia is still incomplete, the Eritrean authorities still do not consider that the peace agreement is formally implemented However, local elections were held for a time in Eritrea The most recent round of local government elections were in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEritrea is divided into six administrative regions These areas are further divided into 58 districts.\n\n\nForeign relations\nEritrea is a member of the United Nations and the African Union It is an observing member of the Arab League, alongside Brazil and Venezuela [33] The nation holds a seat on the United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) Eritrea also holds memberships in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation, International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Permanent Court of Arbitration, Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the World Customs Organization.\n\n\nRelations with Ethiopia\nThe undemarcated border with Ethiopia is the primary external issue currently facing Eritrea Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia turned from that of cautious mutual tolerance, following the 30-year war for Eritrean independence, to a deadly rivalry that led to the outbreak of hostilities from May 1998 to June 2000 that claimed approximately 70,000 lives from both sides [140] The border conflict cost hundreds of millions of dollars [141] The Eritrean–Ethiopian War from 1998 to 2000 involved a major border conflict, notably around Badme and Zalambessa, eventually resolved in 2018 [citation needed]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Eritrean Defence Forces are the official armed forces of the State of Eritrea Eritrea's military is one of the largest in Africa [153]\n\n\nLegal profession\nAccording to the NYU School of Law, the Legal Committee of the Ministry of Justice oversees the admission and requirements to practice law in Eritrea Although the establishment of an independent bar association is not proscribed under Proclamation 88/96, among other domestic laws, there is no bar association The community electorate in the local jurisdiction of the Community Court chooses the court judges The Community Court's standing on women in the legal profession is unclear but elected women judges have reserved seats [156]\n\n\nHuman rights\nEritrea is a one-party state in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed [29] According to Human Rights Watch, the government's human rights record is considered among the worst in the world [30] Most countries have accused the Eritrean authorities of arbitrary arrest and detentions, and of detaining an unknown number of people without charge for their political activism Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are illegal in Eritrea [157]\n\n\nMedia freedom\nIn its 2023 Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked the media environment in Eritrea at 174 [184] [185] According to the BBC, \"Eritrea is the only African country to have no privately owned news media\", [186] and Reporters Without Borders said of the public media, \" [They] do nothing but relay the regime's belligerent and ultra-nationalist discourse.. Not a single  [foreign correspondent] now lives in Asmara.\" [187] The state-owned news agency censors news about external events [188] Independent media have been banned since 2001 [188] The Eritrean authorities had reportedly imprisoned the fourth highest number of journalists after Turkey, China, and Egypt [189]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2020, the IMF estimated Eritrea's GDP at $2.1 billion, or $6.4 billion on a PPP basis [191] \nBetween 2016 and 2019 Eritrea had a GDP growth between 7,6 %-10,2 %, down from the peak at 30,9% in 2014 In 2023 the GDP growth is expected to be 2,8%, a decrease due to factors such as the Ukraine and Russia war impacting the global economy and the effects of COVID-19 on value chains However, the country's economy is expecting a steady growth in coming years [192] [193] [194]\n\n\nMining\nMining accounts for about 20% of GDP in 2021 [196] In 2013, the pickup in growth had been attributed to the commencement of full operations in the gold and silver Bisha Mine by Canadian Nevsun Resources (now Chinese Zijin Mining [197]), the production of cement from the cement factory in Massawa, [198] and investment in Eritrea's copper, zinc, and Colluli potash mining operations by Australian [199] and Chinese [200] mining companies.\n\n\nAgriculture\nSince independence, Eritrea has constructed 187 dams, each with a capacity of over 50,000 m3 and the biggest ones with a capacity of 350 million m3 in size These have been built to combat drought, for agriculture, fishing, and energy purposes In addition, 600 micro-dams have been built [201]\n [207]\n\n\nEnergy\nAnnual consumption of petroleum in 2001 was estimated at 370,000 tons Eritrea has no domestic petroleum production; the Eritrean Petroleum Corporation conducts purchases through international competitive tender According to the U.S Department of Commerce, opportunities exist for both on- and offshore oil and natural gas exploration; however, these prospects have yet to come to fruition The use of wind energy, solar power, hydropower has slightly increased, due to the growth of solar power manufacturing companies in the country The Eritrean government has expressed interest in developing alternative energy sources, including geothermal, solar, and wind power [208]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism made up 2% of Eritrea's economy up to 1997 After 1998, revenue from the industry fell to one-quarter of 1997 levels In 2006, it made up less than 1% of the country's GDP [209]\n\n\nTransportation\nTransport in Eritrea includes highways, airports, railways, and seaports, in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime, and aerial transportation.\n\n\nDemographics\nSources disagree as to the current population of Eritrea, with some proposing numbers as low as 3.6 million [12] and others as high as 6.7 million [13] Eritrea has never conducted an official government census [14]  The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2020 was 41.1%, 54.3% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4.5% were 65 or older [218]\n\n\nUrbanization\nThere are nine recognized ethnic groups according to the government of Eritrea [28] [221] An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the Tigrinya people make up approximately 55% and Tigre people make up approximately 30% of the population A majority of the remaining ethnic groups belong to Afroasiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch, such as the Saho, Hedareb, Afar, and Bilen There are also several Nilotic ethnic groups, who are represented in Eritrea by the Kunama and Nara Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language.\n\n\nEthnic composition\nThere are nine recognized ethnic groups according to the government of Eritrea [28] [221] An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the Tigrinya people make up approximately 55% and Tigre people make up approximately 30% of the population A majority of the remaining ethnic groups belong to Afroasiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch, such as the Saho, Hedareb, Afar, and Bilen There are also several Nilotic ethnic groups, who are represented in Eritrea by the Kunama and Nara Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language.\n\n\nLanguages\nEritrea is a multilingual country The nation has no official language, as the Constitution establishes the \"equality of all Eritrean languages\" [1] Eritrea has nine national languages which are Tigrinya, Tigre, Afar, Beja, Bilen, Kunama, Nara, and Saho Tigrinya, Arabic, and English serve as de facto working languages, with English used in university education and many technical fields While Italian, the former colonial language, holds no government-recognised status in Eritrea, it is spoken by a few monolinguals and Asmara had the Scuola Italiana di Asmara, an Italian government-operated school that was shut down in 2020 [227] Also, native Eritreans assimilated the language of the Italian Eritreans and spoke a version of Italian mixed with many Tigrinya words: Eritrean Italian [228]\n\n\nReligion\nThe two main religions followed in Eritrea are Christianity and Islam However, the number of adherents of each faith is subject to debate According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020 [update], 62.9% of the population of Eritrea adhered to Christianity, 36.6% followed Islam, and 0.4% practiced traditional African religions The remainder observed Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, other faiths (<0.1% each), or were religiously unaffiliated (0.1%) [230] The U.S Department of State estimated that as of 2019 [update], 49% of the population of Eritrea adhered to Christianity, 49% followed Islam, and 2% observed other religions, including traditional faiths and animism [231] The World Religion Database reports that in 2020, 47% of the population were Christian and 51% were Muslim [232] Christianity is the oldest world religion practiced in the country, and the first Christian monastery Debre Sina was built during the fourth century.\n [233]\n\n\nHealth\nEritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for health, in particular child health [241] Life expectancy at birth increased from 39.1 years in 1960 to 66.44 years in 2020; [242] maternal and child mortality rates dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure expanded [241]\n\n\nEducation\nThere are five levels of education in Eritrea: pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary, and post-secondary There are nearly 1,270,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education [245] There are approximately 824 schools, [246] two universities, (the University of Asmara and the Eritrea Institute of Technology), and several smaller colleges and technical schools.\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Eritrea is the collective cultural heritage of the various populations native to Eritrea and its rich cultural heritage inherited through its long history Modern-day Eritrea is also defined by the struggle for independence [250] [251] The nation has a rich oral and literary tradition which ranges across all nine ethnic groups, it includes a wealth of poetry and proverbs, songs and chants, folk tales, histories and legends It also has a rich history in theatre and painting, often colourful and depicting a reflection of the Eritrean people's history [252]\n\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nOn 8 July 2017, the entire capital city of Asmara was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with the inscription taking place during the 41st World Heritage Committee Session.\n\n\nMusic\nEritrea's ethnic groups each have their distinct styles of music and accompanying dances Amongst the Tigrinya, the best-known traditional musical genre is the guaila Traditional instruments of Eritrean folk music include the strung krar, kebero, begena, masenqo, and the wata (a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin) A popular Eritrean artist is the Tigrinya singer Helen Meles, who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range [265] Other prominent local musicians include the Kunama singer Dehab Faytinga, Ruth Abraha, Bereket Mengisteab, the late Yemane Ghebremichael and the late Abraham Afewerki.\n\n\nMedia\nThere are no current independent mass media in Eritrea All media outlets in Eritrea are from the Ministry of Information, a government source.\n\n\nCuisine\nA typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of injera accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, chicken, lamb, or fish [267] Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles that of neighboring Ethiopia, [267] [268] though Eritrean cooking tends to feature more seafood than Ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location [267] Eritrean dishes are also frequently \"lighter\" in texture than Ethiopian meals They likewise tend to employ less seasoned butter and spices and more tomatoes, as in the tsebhi dorho delicacy.\n\n\nSport\nFootball and cycling are the most popular sports in Eritrea [271] [272]\n\n\nSee also\nHailemariam, Chefena;

The country has a long and complex history, with various empires and dynasties rising and falling over the centuries. Today, Eritrea is a sovereign state with a population of approximately 3.6 million people, according to the latest estimates.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Eritrea is derived from the ancient Greek name for the Red Sea, the Erythraean Sea (Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα Erythra Thalassa, based on the adjective ἐρυθρός erythros \"red\"). It was first formally adopted in 1890, with the formation of Italian Eritrea (Colonia Eritrea). The name persisted throughout subsequent British and Ethiopian occupation, and was reaffirmed by the 1993 independence referendum and 1997 constitution.\n\n**History**\n\nArchaeological findings suggest that the area now known as Eritrea has been inhabited for thousands of years. The earliest human fossils found in Eritrea date back to 1 million years ago, during the Pleistocene era. These fossils, known as Madam Buya, are considered to be among the oldest hominid fossils found to date and provide a link between earlier hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans.\n\nThe area was inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the Tigrinya, Tigre, and Saho. In the 10th century BC, the Kingdom of D'mt emerged in the region, which was later conquered by the Kingdom of Aksum in the 4th century AD. The Kingdom of Aksum was a major trading empire that stretched from present-day Eritrea to Ethiopia and Egypt.\n\nAfter the decline of the Kingdom of Aksum, the Eritrean highlands fell under the domain of the Christian Zagwe dynasty, and later, fell under the sphere of influence of the Ethiopian Empire. The area was known as Ma'ikele Bahri, which means \"between the seas/rivers\" in Tigrinya.\n\n**Italian Eritrea**\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Italian government established a presence in Eritrea, and in 1882, the Italian government formally took possession of the Assab colony from its commercial owners. The Italians expanded their control to include Massawa and most of the Eritrean coastal lowlands after the Egyptians withdrew from Eritrea in February 1885.\n\nThe Italian government established a colonial administration in Eritrea, which was known as Colonia Eritrea. The colony was subject to Italian rule until the end of World War II, when the British took control of the region.\n\n**British administration**\n\nThrough the 1941 Battle of Keren, the British expelled the Italians and took over the administration of the country. Economically, the decade of British administration saw a significant restructuring of the Eritrean economy. Until 1945, the British and Americans relied on Italian equipment and skilled labor for wartime needs and to support the Allies in the Middle East. This economic boom lasted until the end of the war, but shortly after the conflict concluded, the Eritrean economy faced a combination of recession and depression that severely impacted the local urban population.\n\n**Annexation by Ethiopia**\n\nIn the 1950s, the Ethiopian feudal administration under Emperor Haile Selassie sought to annex Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. He laid claim to both territories in a letter to Franklin D Roosevelt at the Paris Peace Conference and the First Session of the United Nations. In the United Nations, the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued. The British and Americans preferred to cede all of Eritrea except the Western province to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during World War II. The Independence Bloc of Eritrean parties consistently requested from the United Nations General Assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the Eritrean question of sovereignty.\n\n**Independence**\n\nIn 1958, a group of Eritreans founded the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM).

Other political groups are not allowed to organize, although the unimplemented Constitution of 1997 provides for the existence of multi-party politics. The National Assembly has 150 seats, and national elections have been repeatedly postponed. As of 2022, none have ever been held in the country. President Isaias Afwerki has been in office since independence in 1993.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nEritrea is a member of the United Nations and the African Union. It is an observing member of the Arab League, alongside Brazil and Venezuela. The nation holds a seat on the United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ). Eritrea also holds memberships in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation, International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Permanent Court of Arbitration, Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the World Customs Organization.\n\n**Economy**\n\nIn 2020, the IMF estimated Eritrea's GDP at $2.1 billion, or $6.4 billion on a PPP basis. Between 2016 and 2019, Eritrea had a GDP growth between 7.6% and 10.2%, down from the peak at 30.9% in 2014. In 2023, the GDP growth is expected to be 2.8%, a decrease due to factors such as the Ukraine and Russia war impacting the global economy and the effects of COVID-19 on value chains. However, the country's economy is expecting a steady growth in coming years.\n\n**Mining**\n\nMining accounts for about 20% of GDP in 2021. In 2013, the pickup in growth had been attributed to the commencement of full operations in the gold and silver Bisha Mine by Canadian Nevsun Resources (now Chinese Zijin Mining), the production of cement from the cement factory in Massawa, and investment in Eritrea's copper, zinc, and Colluli potash mining operations by Australian and Chinese mining companies.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nSince independence, Eritrea has constructed 187 dams, each with a capacity of over 50,000 m3, and the biggest ones with a capacity of 350 million m3 in size.

According to the U.S Department of Commerce, opportunities exist for both on- and offshore oil and natural gas exploration; however, these prospects have yet to come to fruition. The use of wind energy, solar power, hydropower has slightly increased, due to the growth of solar power manufacturing companies in the country. The Eritrean government has expressed interest in developing alternative energy sources, including geothermal, solar, and wind power.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nTransport in Eritrea includes highways, airports, railways, and seaports, in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime, and aerial transportation.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nSources disagree as to the current population of Eritrea, with some proposing numbers as low as 3.6 million and others as high as 6.7 million. Eritrea has never conducted an official government census. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2020 was 41.1%, 54.3% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4.5% were 65 or older.\n\n**Urbanization**\n\nThere are nine recognized ethnic groups according to the government of Eritrea. An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the Tigrinya people make up approximately 55% and Tigre people make up approximately 30% of the population. A majority of the remaining ethnic groups belong to Afroasiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch, such as the Saho, Hedareb, Afar, and Bilen. There are also several Nilotic ethnic groups, who are represented in Eritrea by the Kunama and Nara.\n\n**Languages**\n\nEritrea is a multilingual country. The nation has no official language, as the Constitution establishes the \"equality of all Eritrean languages\". Eritrea has nine national languages, which are Tigrinya, Tigre, Afar, Beja, Bilen, Kunama, Nara, and Saho. Tigrinya, Arabic, and English serve as de facto working languages, with English used in university education and many technical fields. While Italian, the former colonial language, holds no government-recognized status in Eritrea, it is spoken by a few monolinguals and Asmara had the Scuola Italiana di Asmara, an Italian government-operated school that was shut down in 2020. Also, native Eritreans assimilated the language of the Italian Eritreans and spoke a version of Italian mixed with many Tigrinya words: Eritrean Italian.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe two main religions followed in Eritrea are Christianity and Islam. However, the number of adherents of each faith is subject to debate. According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020, 62.9% of the population of Eritrea adhered to Christianity, 36.6% followed Islam, and 0.4% practiced traditional African religions. The remainder observed Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, other faiths (<0.1% each), or were religiously unaffiliated (0.1%). The U.S Department of State estimated that as of 2019, 49% of the population of Eritrea adhered to Christianity, 49% followed Islam, and 2% observed other religions, including traditional faiths and animism. The World Religion Database reports that in 2020, 47% of the population were Christian and 51% were Muslim. Christianity is the oldest world religion practiced in the country, and the first Christian monastery Debre Sina was built during the fourth century.\n\n**Health**\n\nEritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for health, in particular child health. Life expectancy at birth increased from 39.1 years in 1960 to 66.44 years in 2020; maternal and child mortality rates dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure expanded.\n\n**Education**\n\nThere are five levels of education in Eritrea: pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary, and post-secondary. There are nearly 1,270,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education. There are approximately 824 schools, two universities, (the University of Asmara and the Eritrea Institute of Technology), and several smaller colleges and technical schools.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe culture of Eritrea is the collective cultural heritage of the various populations native to Eritrea and its rich cultural heritage inherited through its long history. Modern-day Eritrea is also defined by the struggle for independence. The nation has a rich oral and literary tradition which ranges across all nine ethnic groups, it includes a wealth of poetry and proverbs, songs and chants, folk tales, histories and legends. It also has a rich history in theatre and painting, often colourful and depicting a reflection of the Eritrean people's history.\n\n**Music**\n\nEritrea's ethnic groups each have their distinct styles of music and accompanying dances. Amongst the Tigrinya, the best-known traditional musical genre is the guaila. Traditional instruments of Eritrean folk music include the strung krar, kebero, begena, masenqo, and the wata (a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin). A popular Eritrean artist is the Tigrinya singer Helen Meles, who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range. Other prominent local musicians include the Kunama singer Dehab Faytinga, Ruth Abraha, Bereket Mengisteab, the late Yemane Ghebremichael and the late Abraham Afewerki.\n\n**Media**\n\nThere are no current independent mass media in Eritrea. All media outlets in Eritrea are from the Ministry of Information, a government source.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nA typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of injera accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, chicken, lamb, or fish. Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles that of neighboring Ethiopia, though Eritrean cooking tends to feature more seafood than Ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location. Eritrean dishes are also frequently \"lighter\" in texture than Ethiopian meals. They likewise tend to employ less seasoned butter and spices and more tomatoes, as in the tsebhi dorho delicacy.\n\n**Sport**\n\nFootball and cycling are the most popular sports in Eritrea.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eritrea\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Eritrea is derived from the ancient (originally Greek) name for the Red Sea, the Erythraean Sea (Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα Erythra Thalassa, based on the adjective ἐρυθρός erythros \"red\") It was first formally adopted in 1890, with the formation of Italian Eritrea (Colonia Eritrea) [34] The name persisted throughout subsequent British and Ethiopian occupation, and was reaffirmed by the 1993 independence referendum and 1997 constitution [35]\n\n\nHistory\nMadam Buya is the name of a fossil found at an archaeological site in Eritrea by Italian anthropologists She has been identified as among the oldest hominid fossils found to date that reveal significant stages in the evolution of humans and to represent a possible link between the earlier Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens Her remains have been dated to 1 million years old She is the oldest skeletal find of her kind and provides a link between earlier hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans [36] It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was a major site in terms of human evolution and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans [37]\n\n\nPrehistory\nMadam Buya is the name of a fossil found at an archaeological site in Eritrea by Italian anthropologists She has been identified as among the oldest hominid fossils found to date that reveal significant stages in the evolution of humans and to represent a possible link between the earlier Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens Her remains have been dated to 1 million years old She is the oldest skeletal find of her kind and provides a link between earlier hominids and the earliest anatomically modern humans [36] It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was a major site in terms of human evolution and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus hominids to anatomically modern humans [37]\n\n\nAntiquity\nResearch shows tools found in the Barka Valley dating from 8,000 BC appear to offer the first concrete evidence of human settlement in the area [43] Research also shows that many of the ethnic groups of Eritrea were the first to inhabit these areas [44]\n\n\nD'mt\nDʿmt was a kingdom that existed from the tenth to fifth centuries BC in what is now Eritrea and northern Ethiopia Given the presence of a massive temple complex at Yeha, this area was most likely the kingdom's capital Qohaito, often identified as the town of Koloe in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, [57] as well as Matara were important ancient Dʿmt kingdom cities in southern Eritrea.\n\n\nKingdom of Aksum\nThe Kingdom of Aksum (or Axum) was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia [59] It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the fourth century BC to achieve prominence by the first century AD.\n\n\nMedri Bahri\nAfter the decline of Aksum, the Eritrean highlands fell under the domain of the Christian Zagwe dynasty, and later, fell under the sphere of influence of the Ethiopian Empire [68] The area was at first known as Ma'ikele Bahri (\"between the seas/rivers\", i.e the land between the Red Sea and the Mereb river) [69] The entire coastal domain of Ma'ikele Bahri was under the Adal Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Badlay ibn Sa'ad ad-Din [70] [71] The state was later reconquered by the Ethiopian Emperor Zara Yaqob who reorganized the administration of the coastal highlands into the Christian province of Midri-Bahri (\"Sea land\" in Tigrinya, although it included some areas such as Shire in Ethiopia on the other side of the Mereb, today in Ethiopia) ruled by a Bahri Negus (or Bahri Negash, meaning \"sea king\") [72] With its capital at Debarwa, [73] the state's main provinces were Hamasien, Serae, and Akele Guzai.\n\n\nItalian Eritrea\nThe boundaries of present-day Eritrea were established during the Scramble for Africa On 15 November 1869, the ruling local chief sold lands surrounding the Bay of Assab to the Italian missionary Giuseppe Sapeto on behalf of the Rubattino Shipping Company [86] The area served as a coaling station along the shipping lanes introduced by the recently completed Suez Canal In 1882, the Italian government formally took possession of the Assab colony from its commercial owners and expanded their control to include Massawa and most of the Eritrean coastal lowlands after the Egyptians withdrew from Eritrea in February 1885 [87]\n\n\nBritish administration\nThrough the 1941 Battle of Keren, the British expelled the Italians and took over the administration of the country [95] Economically, the decade of British administration saw a significant restructuring of the Eritrean economy Until 1945, the British and Americans relied on Italian equipment and skilled labor for wartime needs and to support the Allies in the Middle East This economic boom, fueled by substantial Italian involvement, lasted until the end of the war However, shortly after the conflict concluded, the Eritrean economy faced a combination of recession and depression that severely impacted the local urban population War factories that had employed thousands were shut down, and Italians began to be repatriated Additionally, many small manufacturing plants established between 1936 and 1945 were forced to close due to intense competition from factories in Europe and the Middle East [96]\n\n\nAnnexation by Ethiopia\nIn the 1950s, the Ethiopian feudal administration under Emperor Haile Selassie sought to annex Eritrea and Italian Somaliland He laid claim to both territories in a letter to Franklin D Roosevelt at the Paris Peace Conference and the First Session of the United Nations [98] In the United Nations, the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued The British and Americans preferred to cede all of Eritrea except the Western province to the Ethiopians as a reward for their support during World War II [99] The Independence Bloc of Eritrean parties consistently requested from the United Nations General Assembly that a referendum be held immediately to settle the Eritrean question of sovereignty.\n\n\nIndependence\nIn 1958, a group of Eritreans founded the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM) The organization mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals, and intellectuals It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state [101] On 1 September 1961, the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), under the leadership of Hamid Idris Awate, waged an armed struggle for independence In 1962, Emperor Haile Selassie unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and annexed the territory The ensuing Eritrean War of Independence went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), a successor of the ELF, defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of Ethiopian rebel forces take control of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.\n\n\nGeography\nEritrea is located in East Africa It is bordered to the northeast and east by the Red Sea, Sudan to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Djibouti to the southeast Eritrea lies between latitudes 12° and 18°N, and longitudes 36° and 44°E.\n\n\nClimate\nBased on temperature variations, Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: the temperate zone, subtropical climate zone, and tropical climate zone [116]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nEritrea has several species of mammals and a rich avifauna of 560 species of birds [120]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) is the only legal party in Eritrea [133] Other political groups are not allowed to organize, although the unimplemented Constitution of 1997 provides for the existence of multi-party politics The National Assembly has 150 seats National elections have been periodically scheduled and cancelled; as of 2022, none have ever been held in the country [28] President Isaias Afwerki has been in office since independence in 1993.\n\n\nNational, regional, and local elections\nGiven that the full implementation of the Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship between Eritrea and Ethiopia is still incomplete, the Eritrean authorities still do not consider that the peace agreement is formally implemented However, local elections were held for a time in Eritrea The most recent round of local government elections were in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEritrea is divided into six administrative regions These areas are further divided into 58 districts.\n\n\nForeign relations\nEritrea is a member of the United Nations and the African Union It is an observing member of the Arab League, alongside Brazil and Venezuela [33] The nation holds a seat on the United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) Eritrea also holds memberships in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation, International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Permanent Court of Arbitration, Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa, and the World Customs Organization.\n\n\nRelations with Ethiopia\nThe undemarcated border with Ethiopia is the primary external issue currently facing Eritrea Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia turned from that of cautious mutual tolerance, following the 30-year war for Eritrean independence, to a deadly rivalry that led to the outbreak of hostilities from May 1998 to June 2000 that claimed approximately 70,000 lives from both sides [140] The border conflict cost hundreds of millions of dollars [141] The Eritrean–Ethiopian War from 1998 to 2000 involved a major border conflict, notably around Badme and Zalambessa, eventually resolved in 2018 [citation needed]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Eritrean Defence Forces are the official armed forces of the State of Eritrea Eritrea's military is one of the largest in Africa [153]\n\n\nLegal profession\nAccording to the NYU School of Law, the Legal Committee of the Ministry of Justice oversees the admission and requirements to practice law in Eritrea Although the establishment of an independent bar association is not proscribed under Proclamation 88/96, among other domestic laws, there is no bar association The community electorate in the local jurisdiction of the Community Court chooses the court judges The Community Court's standing on women in the legal profession is unclear but elected women judges have reserved seats [156]\n\n\nHuman rights\nEritrea is a one-party state in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed [29] According to Human Rights Watch, the government's human rights record is considered among the worst in the world [30] Most countries have accused the Eritrean authorities of arbitrary arrest and detentions, and of detaining an unknown number of people without charge for their political activism Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are illegal in Eritrea [157]\n\n\nMedia freedom\nIn its 2023 Press Freedom Index, Reporters Without Borders ranked the media environment in Eritrea at 174 [184] [185] According to the BBC, \"Eritrea is the only African country to have no privately owned news media\", [186] and Reporters Without Borders said of the public media, \" [They] do nothing but relay the regime's belligerent and ultra-nationalist discourse.. Not a single  [foreign correspondent] now lives in Asmara.\" [187] The state-owned news agency censors news about external events [188] Independent media have been banned since 2001 [188] The Eritrean authorities had reportedly imprisoned the fourth highest number of journalists after Turkey, China, and Egypt [189]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2020, the IMF estimated Eritrea's GDP at $2.1 billion, or $6.4 billion on a PPP basis [191] \nBetween 2016 and 2019 Eritrea had a GDP growth between 7,6 %-10,2 %, down from the peak at 30,9% in 2014 In 2023 the GDP growth is expected to be 2,8%, a decrease due to factors such as the Ukraine and Russia war impacting the global economy and the effects of COVID-19 on value chains However, the country's economy is expecting a steady growth in coming years [192] [193] [194]\n\n\nMining\nMining accounts for about 20% of GDP in 2021 [196] In 2013, the pickup in growth had been attributed to the commencement of full operations in the gold and silver Bisha Mine by Canadian Nevsun Resources (now Chinese Zijin Mining [197]), the production of cement from the cement factory in Massawa, [198] and investment in Eritrea's copper, zinc, and Colluli potash mining operations by Australian [199] and Chinese [200] mining companies.\n\n\nAgriculture\nSince independence, Eritrea has constructed 187 dams, each with a capacity of over 50,000 m3 and the biggest ones with a capacity of 350 million m3 in size These have been built to combat drought, for agriculture, fishing, and energy purposes In addition, 600 micro-dams have been built [201]\n [207]\n\n\nEnergy\nAnnual consumption of petroleum in 2001 was estimated at 370,000 tons Eritrea has no domestic petroleum production; the Eritrean Petroleum Corporation conducts purchases through international competitive tender According to the U.S Department of Commerce, opportunities exist for both on- and offshore oil and natural gas exploration; however, these prospects have yet to come to fruition The use of wind energy, solar power, hydropower has slightly increased, due to the growth of solar power manufacturing companies in the country The Eritrean government has expressed interest in developing alternative energy sources, including geothermal, solar, and wind power [208]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism made up 2% of Eritrea's economy up to 1997 After 1998, revenue from the industry fell to one-quarter of 1997 levels In 2006, it made up less than 1% of the country's GDP [209]\n\n\nTransportation\nTransport in Eritrea includes highways, airports, railways, and seaports, in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime, and aerial transportation.\n\n\nDemographics\nSources disagree as to the current population of Eritrea, with some proposing numbers as low as 3.6 million [12] and others as high as 6.7 million [13] Eritrea has never conducted an official government census [14]  The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2020 was 41.1%, 54.3% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 4.5% were 65 or older [218]\n\n\nUrbanization\nThere are nine recognized ethnic groups according to the government of Eritrea [28] [221] An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the Tigrinya people make up approximately 55% and Tigre people make up approximately 30% of the population A majority of the remaining ethnic groups belong to Afroasiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch, such as the Saho, Hedareb, Afar, and Bilen There are also several Nilotic ethnic groups, who are represented in Eritrea by the Kunama and Nara Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language.\n\n\nEthnic composition\nThere are nine recognized ethnic groups according to the government of Eritrea [28] [221] An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the Tigrinya people make up approximately 55% and Tigre people make up approximately 30% of the population A majority of the remaining ethnic groups belong to Afroasiatic-speaking communities of the Cushitic branch, such as the Saho, Hedareb, Afar, and Bilen There are also several Nilotic ethnic groups, who are represented in Eritrea by the Kunama and Nara Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language.\n\n\nLanguages\nEritrea is a multilingual country The nation has no official language, as the Constitution establishes the \"equality of all Eritrean languages\" [1] Eritrea has nine national languages which are Tigrinya, Tigre, Afar, Beja, Bilen, Kunama, Nara, and Saho Tigrinya, Arabic, and English serve as de facto working languages, with English used in university education and many technical fields While Italian, the former colonial language, holds no government-recognised status in Eritrea, it is spoken by a few monolinguals and Asmara had the Scuola Italiana di Asmara, an Italian government-operated school that was shut down in 2020 [227] Also, native Eritreans assimilated the language of the Italian Eritreans and spoke a version of Italian mixed with many Tigrinya words: Eritrean Italian [228]\n\n\nReligion\nThe two main religions followed in Eritrea are Christianity and Islam However, the number of adherents of each faith is subject to debate According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2020 [update], 62.9% of the population of Eritrea adhered to Christianity, 36.6% followed Islam, and 0.4% practiced traditional African religions The remainder observed Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, other faiths (<0.1% each), or were religiously unaffiliated (0.1%) [230] The U.S Department of State estimated that as of 2019 [update], 49% of the population of Eritrea adhered to Christianity, 49% followed Islam, and 2% observed other religions, including traditional faiths and animism [231] The World Religion Database reports that in 2020, 47% of the population were Christian and 51% were Muslim [232] Christianity is the oldest world religion practiced in the country, and the first Christian monastery Debre Sina was built during the fourth century.\n [233]\n\n\nHealth\nEritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for health, in particular child health [241] Life expectancy at birth increased from 39.1 years in 1960 to 66.44 years in 2020; [242] maternal and child mortality rates dropped dramatically and the health infrastructure expanded [241]\n\n\nEducation\nThere are five levels of education in Eritrea: pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary, and post-secondary There are nearly 1,270,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education [245] There are approximately 824 schools, [246] two universities, (the University of Asmara and the Eritrea Institute of Technology), and several smaller colleges and technical schools.\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Eritrea is the collective cultural heritage of the various populations native to Eritrea and its rich cultural heritage inherited through its long history Modern-day Eritrea is also defined by the struggle for independence [250] [251] The nation has a rich oral and literary tradition which ranges across all nine ethnic groups, it includes a wealth of poetry and proverbs, songs and chants, folk tales, histories and legends It also has a rich history in theatre and painting, often colourful and depicting a reflection of the Eritrean people's history [252]\n\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\nOn 8 July 2017, the entire capital city of Asmara was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with the inscription taking place during the 41st World Heritage Committee Session.\n\n\nMusic\nEritrea's ethnic groups each have their distinct styles of music and accompanying dances Amongst the Tigrinya, the best-known traditional musical genre is the guaila Traditional instruments of Eritrean folk music include the strung krar, kebero, begena, masenqo, and the wata (a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin) A popular Eritrean artist is the Tigrinya singer Helen Meles, who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range [265] Other prominent local musicians include the Kunama singer Dehab Faytinga, Ruth Abraha, Bereket Mengisteab, the late Yemane Ghebremichael and the late Abraham Afewerki.\n\n\nMedia\nThere are no current independent mass media in Eritrea All media outlets in Eritrea are from the Ministry of Information, a government source.\n\n\nCuisine\nA typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of injera accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, chicken, lamb, or fish [267] Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles that of neighboring Ethiopia, [267] [268] though Eritrean cooking tends to feature more seafood than Ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location [267] Eritrean dishes are also frequently \"lighter\" in texture than Ethiopian meals They likewise tend to employ less seasoned butter and spices and more tomatoes, as in the tsebhi dorho delicacy.\n\n\nSport\nFootball and cycling are the most popular sports in Eritrea [271] [272]\n\n\nSee also\nHailemariam, Chefena;

third unidentified man snuck into the barn of the Southeast 444th Street farm that night Either Pinyan or the unidentified man recorded Tait being anally penetrated by a stallion the men had referred to as \"Big Dick\" After finishing, Tait then filmed Pinyan being anally penetrated by the same horse During this incident, Pinyan sustained internal injuries including a perforated colon [2]

zoophile chat rooms as a destination for people wanting to have sex with livestock, and seized 100 VHS tapes and DVDs amounting to hundreds of hours of video of men engaging in bestiality One of the videotapes featured Kenneth Pinyan shortly before he died on July 2 [15] [17]\n\n\nMedia reporting\nJennifer Sullivan, a Seattle Times staff reporter, said that originally the King County Sheriff's Department did not expect the local newspapers to report on the event because of its gruesome nature However, after an Associated Press report stated that the farm where the event occurred attracted a

that the men had entered the property to engage in bestiality The third man was not charged since he was not visible in the videos seized by investigators [2] On November 29, 2005, Tait entered an Alford plea, a form of guilty plea in which the accused maintains that they are factually innocent but acknowledges that the evidence would likely lead to conviction and thus accept being convicted

He was a versatile performer who appeared in a wide range of roles, often typecast in authority figures due to his height of 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m). Challis was born on 16 August 1942 in Bristol, England, and spent his early years in Surrey before pursuing a career in the arts.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJohn Challis was born on 16 August 1942 at St Andrews Nursing Home in Clifton, Bristol, England. His family moved to Southeast London when he was just one year old, and he grew up in Epsom, Surrey. Challis' father, Alec, was a civil servant at the Admiralty, while his mother, Joan (née Harden), was a drama teacher and a keen participant in amateur dramatics. Challis was an only child, and his parents' influence encouraged his early interest in the performing arts.\n\nChallis attended the state boarding Ottershaw School near Woking, Surrey, where he developed his acting skills. His parents' encouragement and the school's emphasis on drama helped shape his early ambitions. Challis' family moved to Surrey when he was a young boy, and he spent much of his childhood in the county.\n\n**Career**\n\nChallis began his television career in the late 1960s, with his first role appearing in the BBC soap opera \"The Newcomers\" in 1967.

He also appeared in the gangster drama \"Big Breadwinner Hog\" and made regular appearances in \"Z-Cars\" as Sergeant Culshaw. Challis' versatility and range made him a sought-after actor in television.\n\n**Television and Radio**\n\nChallis' television career spanned over four decades, with appearances in numerous shows and series. He was known for his authority figures, often playing roles as police officers, detectives, and other figures of power. Challis' height and presence often made him a natural fit for these roles.\n\nIn addition to his television work, Challis also appeared in radio dramas and plays. His voice and acting skills made him a popular choice for radio performances, and he appeared in a range of productions throughout his career.\n\n**Theatre**\n\nChallis performed in many stage productions, including with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1960s and the National Theatre. His first performance in London's West End was in \"Portrait of a Queen\" in 1965 at the Vaudeville Theatre. Challis' theatre career spanned many years, with appearances in a wide range of productions.\n\nIn 1977, Challis played a leading role at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond in Sam Walters' production of Václav Havel's play \"The Memorandum.\" He also toured the US with Tom Stoppard's play \"Cahoot's Macbeth\" in 1979. Challis' theatre work showcased his versatility and range as an actor.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nChallis was married four times, with his first wife being a stage manager, Jean Robertson. His second and third wives were actresses Debbie Arnold and Sabina Franklyn. Challis married his fourth wife, Carol Davies, in Brighton in 1995. In 1998, they bought the Abbot's Lodgings at Wigmore Abbey Grange, Adforton, Herefordshire, which they renovated.\n\nChallis had no children, and his personal life was marked by his love of the arts and his dedicated career as an actor. His marriage to Carol Davies was a long and happy one, and they spent many years together.\n\n**Death**\n\nChallis died of cancer in his sleep on 17 September 2021, aged 79. His death was reported two days later, and he was remembered by his friends and colleagues as a talented and dedicated actor.

{"title": "Canary_Islands", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Islas Canarias is likely derived from the Latin name Canariae Insulae, meaning \"Islands of the Dogs\", perhaps because monk seals or sea dogs were abundant, a name that was evidently generalized from the ancient name of one of these islands, Canaria – presumably Gran Canaria According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the island Canaria contained \"vast multitudes of dogs of very large size\" [25] The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms.\n\n\nIslands\nFrom west to east, the Canary Islands are El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and La Graciosa North of Lanzarote are the islets of Montaña Clara, Alegranza, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste, belonging to the Chinijo Archipelago Northeast of Fuerteventura is the islet of Lobos There are a series of small adjacent rocks in the Canary Islands: the Roques de Anaga, Garachico and Fasnia in Tenerife, and Salmor and Bonanza in El Hierro.\n\n\nEl Hierro\nEl Hierro, the westernmost island, covers 268.71 km2 (103.75 sq mi) It is the second smallest of the major islands, and the least populous with 10,798 inhabitants The whole island was declared a Reserve of the Biosphere in 2000 Its capital is Valverde Also known as Ferro, it was once the westernmost known land in the world Ancient European geographers such as Ptolemy recognised the island as the prime meridian of longitude That remained so until the 19th century, when it was displaced by the one passing through Greenwich [27] [28]\n\n\nFuerteventura\nFuerteventura, with a surface of 1,660 km2 (640 sq mi), is the second largest island of the archipelago It has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO It is the oldest of the islands being more eroded Its highest point is the Peak of the Bramble, at a height of 807 metres (2,648 feet) Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.\n\n\nGran Canaria\nGran Canaria has

National Park is located on the island.\n\n\nLanzarote\nLanzarote is the easternmost island and one of the oldest of the archipelago, and it has shown evidence of recent volcanic activity It has a surface of 845.94 km2 (326.62 sq mi), and a population of 149,183 inhabitants, including the adjacent islets of the Chinijo Archipelago The capital is Arrecife, with 56,834 inhabitants.\n\n\nChinijo Archipelago\nThe Chinijo Archipelago includes the islands La Graciosa, Alegranza, Montaña Clara, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste It has a surface of 40.8 km2 (15.8 sq mi), and only La Graciosa is populated, with 658 inhabitants With 29 km2 (11 sq mi), La Graciosa is the largest island of the Chinijo Archipelago and the smallest inhabited island of the Canaries.\n\n\nLa Palma\nLa Palma, with 81,863 inhabitants covering an area of 708.32 km2 (273.48 sq mi), is in its entirety a biosphere reserve For long it showed no signs of volcanic activity, even though the volcano Teneguía entered into eruption last in 1971 On 19 September 2021, the volcanic Cumbre Vieja on the island erupted [29] It is the second-highest island of the Canaries, with the Roque de los Muchachos at 2,423 metres (7,949 feet) as its highest point Santa Cruz de La Palma, known to those on the island as simply \"Santa Cruz\", is its capital.\n\n\nTenerife\nTenerife is, with its area of 2,034 km2 (785 sq mi), the most extensive island of the Canary Islands With 904,713 inhabitants, it is the most populated island of the archipelago and Spain Two of the islands' principal cities are located on it: the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Cristóbal de La Laguna, a World Heritage Site San Cristóbal de La Laguna, the second city of the island, is home to the oldest university in the Canary Islands, the University of La Laguna Teide, with its 3,715 metres (12,188 feet) is the highest peak of Spain and a World Heritage Site Tenerife is the site of the worst air disaster in the history of aviation, in which 583 people were killed in the collision of two Boeing 747s on 27 March 1977.\n\n\nLa Graciosa\nGraciosa Island or commonly La Graciosa is a volcanic island in the Canary Islands of Spain, located 2 km (1.2 mi) north of the island of Lanzarote across the Strait of El Río It was formed by the Canary hotspot The island is part of the Chinijo Archipelago and the Chinijo Archipelago Natural Park (Parque Natural del Archipiélago Chinijo) It is administered by the municipality of Teguise In 2018, La Graciosa was declared as the eighth Canary Island by the Spanish Senate, [30] [31] [32] though it is not recognized as such by the Canarian administration It is administratively dependent on the island of Lanzarote It is the smallest and least populated of the main islands, with about 700 people.\n\n\nData\nTenerife is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago Gran Canaria, with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after Tenerife (966,354 inhabitants) and Majorca (896,038 inhabitants) [citation needed] The island of Fuerteventura is the second largest in the archipelago and located 100 km (62 mi) from the African coast.\n\n\nPhysical geography\nTenerife is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago Gran Canaria, with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after Tenerife (966,354 inhabitants) and Majorca (896,038 inhabitants) [citation needed] The island of Fuerteventura is the second largest in the archipelago and located 100 km (62 mi) from the African coast.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is warm subtropical/tropical and generally arid, moderated by the sea and in summer by the trade winds [36] There are a number of microclimates and the classifications range mainly from semi-desert to desert The majority of the Canary Islands have a hot desert climate (BWh) and a hot semi-desert climate (BSh) within the Köppen system, caused partly due to the cool Canary Current [37] A subtropical humid climate, which is very influenced by the ocean, is in the middle of the islands of La Gomera, Tenerife and La Palma, where laurisilva cloud forests grow [38]\n\n\nGeology\nThe seven major islands, one minor island, and several small islets were originally volcanic islands, formed by the Canary hotspot [44] The Canary Islands is the only place in Spain where volcanic eruptions have been recorded during the Modern Era, with some volcanoes still active (El Hierro, 2011) [45]\nVolcanic islands such as those in the Canary chain often have steep ocean cliffs caused by catastrophic debris avalanches and landslides [46] The island chain's most recent eruption occurred at Cumbre Vieja, a volcanic ridge on La Palma, in 2021 [47]\n\n\nNatural symbols\nThe official natural symbols associated with Canary Islands are the bird Serinus canaria (canary) and the Phoenix canariensis palm [56]\n\n\nNational parks\nFour of Spain's thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community Two of these have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the other two are part of Biosphere Reserves The parks are: [57]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe regional executive body, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, is presided over by Fernando Clavijo Batlle (Canarian Coalition), the current President of the Canary Islands The members of the regional legislature, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, has 70 elected legislators The last regional election took place in May 2023.\n\n\nGovernance\nThe regional executive body, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, is presided over by Fernando Clavijo Batlle (Canarian Coalition), the current President of the Canary Islands The members of the regional legislature, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, has 70 elected legislators The last regional election took place in May 2023.\n\n\nPolitical geography\nThe Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands has two provinces (provincias), Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, whose capitals, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, are capitals of the autonomous community Each of the seven major islands are ruled by an island council named a Cabildo Insular Each island is subdivided into smaller municipalities (municipios) Las Palmas is divided into 34 municipalities, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is divided into 54 municipalities [60]\n\n\nCanarian nationalism\nThere are some pro-independence political parties, like the National Congress of the Canaries (CNC) and the Popular Front of the Canary Islands Their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the cabildos insulares [citation needed] In a 2012 study by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, when asked about national identity, the majority of respondents from the Canary Islands (53.8%) considered themselves Spanish and Canarian in equal measures, followed by 24% who consider themselves more Canarian than Spanish 6.1% of the respondents considered themselves only Canarian, and 7% considered themselves only Spanish [63]\n\n\nDefense\nThe defense of the territory is the responsibility of the Spanish Armed Forces Components of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Civil Guard are based in the territory.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nAncient and pre-Hispanic times\nBefore the arrival of humans, the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals including the giant lizard (Gallotia goliath), the Tenerife and Gran Canaria giant rats, [64] and giant tortoises, Geochelone burchardi and Geochelone vulcanica.\n\n\nExploration\nThe islands may have been visited by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Carthaginians King Juba II, Caesar Augustus's Numidian protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world According to Pliny the Elder, Juba found the islands uninhabited, but found \"a small temple of stone\" and \"some traces of buildings\" [75] Juba dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador in what is now western Morocco in the early first century AD [76] That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base [citation needed]\n\n\nCastilian conquest\nIn 1402, the Castilian colonisation of the islands began with the expedition of the French explorers Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle, nobles and vassals of Henry III of Castile, to Lanzarote From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro These invasions were \"brutal cultural and military clashes between the indigenous population and the Castilians\" lasting over a century due to formidable resistance by indigenous Canarians [66] Professor Mohamed Adhikari has defined the conquest of the islands as a genocide of the Guanches [78] [79]\n\n\nAfter the conquest and the introduction of slavery\nAfter the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first sugarcane; then wine, an important item of trade with England Gran Canaria was conquered by the Crown of Castile on 6 March 1480, and Tenerife was conquered in 1496, and each had its own governor There has been speculation that the abundance of Roccella tinctoria on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for Jean de Béthencourt during his conquest of the islands Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes This includes royal purple colors derived from R tinctoria, also known as orseille [82]\n\n\n18th to 19th century\nThe sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's Caribbean colonies Low sugar prices in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands A new cash crop, cochineal (cochinilla), came into cultivation during this time, reinvigorating the islands' economy During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum were sold in American ports such as Veracruz, Campeche, La Guaira and Havana, among others [89]\n\n\nRomantic period and scientific expeditions\nSirera and Renn (2004) [95] distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770–1830, which they term \"the Romantic period\":\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new cash-crop, the banana, the export of which was controlled by companies such as Fyffes.\n\n\nFranco regime\nIn 1936, Francisco Franco was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the Spanish Civil War Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of Vallehermoso, on La Gomera Though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the Canaries was most severe [98]\n\n\nSelf-governance\nAfter the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in Algeria, the Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago (MAIAC) In 1968, the Organisation of African Unity recognized the MAIAC as a legitimate African independence movement, and declared the Canary Islands as an African territory still under foreign rule [102]\n\n\nCapitals\nAt present, the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain that has two capitals: Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, since the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands  [es] was created in 1982 [16] [17]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Canary Islands have a population of 2,153,389 inhabitants (2019), making it the eighth most populous of Spain's autonomous communities [3] The total area of the archipelago is 7,493 km2 (2,893 sq mi), [113] resulting in a population density of 287.4 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n\n\nReligion\nThe Catholic Church has been the majority religion in the archipelago for more than five centuries, ever since the Conquest of the Canary Islands There are also several other religious communities.\n\n\nRoman Catholic Church\nThe overwhelming majority of native Canarians are Roman Catholic (76.7%) [118] with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as Protestants.\n\n\nOther religions\nSeparate from the overwhelming Catholic majority are a minority of Muslims [121] Among the followers of Islam, the Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands exists to represent the Islamic community in the Canary Islands as well as to provide practical support to members of the Islamic community [122] For its part, there is also the Evangelical Council of the Canary Islands in the archipelago.\n\n\nStatistics\nThe distribution of beliefs in 2012 according to the CIS Barometer Autonomy was as follows: [123]\n\n\nPopulation genetics\nThe economy is based primarily on tourism, which makes up 32% of the GDP The Canaries receive about 12 million tourists per year Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more arid islands, are being overexploited but there are still many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cochineal, sugarcane, grapes, vines, dates, oranges, lemons, figs, wheat, barley, maize, apricots, peaches and almonds.\n\n\nEconomy and environment\nThe economy is based primarily on tourism, which makes up 32% of the GDP The Canaries receive about 12 million tourists per year

Canary Islands, officially known as the Islas Canarias, are a Spanish archipelago located off the northwest coast of Africa. The islands are a popular tourist destination, known for their beautiful beaches, mild climate, and rich cultural heritage.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Islas Canarias is likely derived from the Latin name Canariae Insulae, meaning \"Islands of the Dogs\", perhaps because monk seals or sea dogs were abundant, a name that was evidently generalized from the ancient name of one of these islands, Canaria – presumably Gran Canaria. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the island Canaria contained \"vast multitudes of dogs of very large size\". The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms.\n\n**Islands**\n\nFrom west to east, the Canary Islands are El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and La Graciosa. North of Lanzarote are the islets of Montaña Clara, Alegranza, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste, belonging to the Chinijo Archipelago. Northeast of Fuerteventura is the islet of Lobos. There are a series of small adjacent rocks in the Canary Islands: the Roques de Anaga, Garachico and Fasnia in Tenerife, and Salmor and Bonanza in El Hierro.\n\n**El Hierro**\n\nEl Hierro, the westernmost island, covers 268.71 km2 (103.75 sq mi). It is the second smallest of the major islands, and the least populous with 10,798 inhabitants. The whole island was declared a Reserve of the Biosphere in 2000. Its capital is Valverde. Also known as Ferro, it was once the westernmost known land in the world. Ancient European geographers such as Ptolemy recognised the island as the prime meridian of longitude. That remained so until the 19th century, when it was displaced by the one passing through Greenwich.\n\n**Fuerteventura**\n\nFuerteventura, with a surface of 1,660 km2 (640 sq mi), is the second largest island of the archipelago. It has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. It is the oldest of the islands being more eroded. Its highest point is the Peak of the Bramble, at a height of 807 metres (2,648 feet). Its capital is Puerto del Rosario.\n\n**Gran Canaria**\n\nGran Canaria has 846,717 inhabitants. The capital, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, with 377,203 inhabitants, is the most populous city and shares the status of capital of the Canaries with Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Gran Canaria's surface area is 1,560 km2 (600 sq mi). Roque Nublo 1,813 metres (5,948 feet) and Pico de las Nieves (\"Peak of Snow\") 1,949 metres (6,394 feet) are located in the center of the island. On the south of the island are the Maspalomas Dunes (Gran Canaria).\n\n**La Gomera**\n\nLa Gomera (informally known as 'Isla Colombina') has an area of 369.76 km2 (142.77 sq mi) and is the second least populous island with 21,136 inhabitants. It has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. Geologically it is one of the oldest of the archipelago. The insular capital is San Sebastian de La Gomera. Garajonay National Park is located on the island.\n\n**Lanzarote**\n\nLanzarote is the easternmost island and one of the oldest of the archipelago, and it has shown evidence of recent volcanic activity. It has a surface of 845.94 km2 (326.62 sq mi), and a population of 149,183 inhabitants, including the adjacent islets of the Chinijo Archipelago. The capital is Arrecife, with 56,834 inhabitants.\n\n**Chinijo Archipelago**\n\nThe Chinijo Archipelago includes the islands La Graciosa, Alegranza, Montaña Clara, Roque del Este and Roque del Oeste. It has a surface of 40.8 km2 (15.8 sq mi), and only La Graciosa is populated, with 658 inhabitants. With 29 km2 (11 sq mi), La Graciosa is the largest island of the Chinijo Archipelago and the smallest inhabited island of the Canaries.\n\n**La Palma**\n\nLa Palma, with 81,863 inhabitants covering an area of 708.32 km2 (273.48 sq mi), is in its entirety a biosphere reserve. For long it showed no signs of volcanic activity, even though the volcano Teneguía entered into eruption last in 1971. On 19 September 2021, the volcanic Cumbre Vieja on the island erupted. It is the second-highest island of the Canaries, with the Roque de los Muchachos at 2,423 metres (7,949 feet) as its highest point. Santa Cruz de La Palma, known to those on the island as simply \"Santa Cruz\", is its capital.\n\n**Tenerife**\n\nTenerife is, with its area of 2,034 km2 (785 sq mi), the most extensive island of the Canary Islands. With 904,713 inhabitants, it is the most populated island of the archipelago and Spain. Two of the islands' principal cities are located on it: the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Cristóbal de La Laguna, a World Heritage Site. San Cristóbal de La Laguna, the second city of the island, is home to the oldest university in the Canary Islands, the University of La Laguna. Teide, with its 3,715 metres (12,188 feet) is the highest peak of Spain and a World Heritage Site. Tenerife is the site of the worst air disaster in the history of aviation, in which 583 people were killed in the collision of two Boeing 747s on 27 March 1977.\n\n**La Graciosa**\n\nLa Graciosa is a volcanic island in the Canary Islands of Spain, located 2 km (1.2 mi) north of the island of Lanzarote across the Strait of El Río. It was formed by the Canary hotspot. The island is part of the Chinijo Archipelago and the Chinijo Archipelago Natural Park (Parque Natural del Archipiélago Chinijo). It is administered by the municipality of Teguise. In 2018, La Graciosa was declared as the eighth Canary Island by the Spanish Senate, though it is not recognized as such by the Canarian administration. It is administratively dependent on the island of Lanzarote. It is the smallest and least populated of the main islands, with about 700 people.\n\n**Data**\n\nTenerife is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago. Gran Canaria, with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after Tenerife (966,354 inhabitants) and Majorca (896,038 inhabitants). The island of Fuerteventura is the second largest in the archipelago and located 100 km (62 mi) from the African coast.\n\n**Physical geography**\n\nThe Canary Islands have a diverse geography, with volcanic landscapes, beaches, and mountains. The islands are located off the northwest coast of Africa, and are part of the Macaronesian region. The archipelago is composed of seven major islands: El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, and Lanzarote. Each island has its own unique geography, with a range of landscapes and ecosystems.\n\n**Climate**\n\nThe climate in the Canary Islands is subtropical, with mild winters and warm summers. The islands are influenced by the trade winds, which bring warm air from the equator. The climate is generally dry, with low humidity and moderate temperatures. The islands have a range of microclimates, with varying conditions on each island.\n\n**Geology**\n\nThe Canary Islands are a volcanic archipelago, with a history of volcanic activity dating back millions of years. The islands are the result of volcanic eruptions, which have created a range of landscapes and geological features. The geology of the islands is diverse, with a range of rocks and minerals present.\n\n**Natural symbols**\n\nThe official natural symbols associated with the Canary Islands are the bird Serinus canaria (canary) and the Phoenix canariensis palm.\n\n**National parks**\n\nFour of Spain's thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community. Two of these have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the other two are part of Biosphere Reserves. The parks are:\n\n* Garajonay National Park\n* Caldera de Taburiente National Park\n* Timanfaya National Park\n* Teide National Park\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe regional executive body, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, is presided over by Fernando Clavijo Batlle (Canarian Coalition), the current President of the Canary Islands. The members of the regional legislature, the Parliament of the Canary Islands, has 70 elected legislators. The last regional election took place in May 2023.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands has two provinces (provincias), Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, whose capitals, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, are capitals of the autonomous community. Each of the seven major islands are ruled by an island council named a Cabildo Insular. Each island is subdivided into smaller municipalities (municipios). Las Palmas is divided into 34 municipalities, and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is divided into 54 municipalities.\n\n**Canarian nationalism**\n\nThere are some pro-independence political parties, like the National Congress of the Canaries (CNC) and the Popular Front of the Canary Islands. Their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the cabildos insulares. In a 2012 study by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, when asked about national identity, the majority of respondents from the Canary Islands (53.8%) considered themselves Spanish and Canarian in equal measures, followed by 24% who consider themselves more Canarian than Spanish 6.1% of the respondents considered themselves only Canarian, and 7% considered themselves only Spanish.\n\n**Defense**\n\nThe defense of the territory is the responsibility of the Spanish Armed Forces. Components of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Civil Guard are based in the territory.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of the Canary Islands begins with the arrival of humans, who settled on the islands around 2000 BC. The islands were later visited by the Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about the islands, describing them as being inhabited by a people called the Canarii.\n\n**Ancient and pre-Hispanic times**\n\nBefore the arrival of humans, the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals including the giant lizard (Gallotia goliath), the Tenerife and Gran Canaria giant rats, and giant tortoises, Geochelone burchardi and Geochelone vulcanica.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nThe islands may have been visited by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Carthaginians. King Juba II, Caesar Augustus's Numidian protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world. According to Pliny the Elder, Juba found the islands uninhabited, but found \"a small temple of stone\" and \"some traces of buildings\". Juba dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at Mogador in what is now western Morocco in the early first century AD. That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base.\n\n**Castilian conquest**\n\nIn 1402, the Castilian colonisation of the islands began with the expedition of the French explorers Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle, nobles and vassals of Henry III of Castile, to Lanzarote. From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. These invasions were \"brutal cultural and military clashes between the indigenous population and the Castilians\" lasting over a century due to formidable resistance by indigenous Canarians. Professor Mohamed Adhikari has defined the conquest of the islands as a genocide of the Guanches.\n\n**After the conquest and the introduction of slavery**\n\nAfter the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first sugarcane; then wine, an important item of trade with England. Gran Canaria was conquered by the Crown of Castile on 6 March 1480, and Tenerife was conquered in 1496, and each had its own governor. There has been speculation that the abundance of Roccella tinctoria on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for Jean de Béthencourt during his conquest of the islands. Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes, including royal purple colors derived from R tinctoria, also known as orseille.\n\n**18th to 19th century**\n\nThe sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's Caribbean colonies. Low sugar prices in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, cochineal (cochinilla), came into cultivation during this time, reinvigorating the islands' economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum were sold in American ports such as Veracruz, Campeche, La Guaira and Havana, among others.\n\n**Romantic period and scientific expeditions**\n\nSirera and Renn (2004) distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770–1830, which they term \"the Romantic period\".\n\n**Early 20th century**\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new cash-crop, the banana, the export of which was controlled by companies such as Fyffes.\n\n**Franco regime**\n\nIn 1936, Francisco Franco was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the Spanish Civil War. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of Vallehermoso, on La Gomera. Though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the Canaries was most severe.\n\n**Self-governance**\n\nAfter the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in Algeria, the Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago (MAIAC). In 1968, the Organisation of African Unity recognized the MAIAC as a legitimate African independence movement, and declared the Canary Islands as an African territory still under foreign rule.\n\n**Capitals**\n\nAt present, the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain that has two capitals: Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, since the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands was created in 1982.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe Canary Islands have a population of 2,153,389 inhabitants (2019), making it the eighth most populous of Spain's autonomous communities. The total area of the archipelago is 7,493 km2 (2,893 sq mi), resulting in a population density of 287.4 inhabitants per square kilometre.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe Catholic Church has been the majority religion in the archipelago for more than five centuries, ever since the Conquest of the Canary Islands. There are also several other religious communities.\n\n**Roman Catholic Church**\n\nThe overwhelming majority of native Canarians are Roman Catholic (76.7%) with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as Protestants.\n\n**Other religions**\n\nSeparate from the overwhelming Catholic majority are a minority of Muslims. Among the followers of Islam, the Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands exists to represent the Islamic community in the Canary Islands as well as to provide practical support to members of the Islamic community. For its part, there is also the Evangelical Council of the Canary Islands in the archipelago.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nThe distribution of beliefs in 2012 according to the CIS Barometer Autonomy was as follows:\n\n* Roman Catholic: 76.7%\n* Muslim: 1.3%\n* Protestant: 1.1%\n* Non-practicing Christian: 2.4%\n* Non-practicing Muslim: 0.3%\n* Other Christian denominations: 1.3%\n* Other religions: 0.2%\n* Atheist or non-religious: 16.3%\n\n**Population genetics**\n\nThe economy is based primarily on tourism, which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12 million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more arid islands, are being overexploited but there are still many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cochineal, sugarcane, grapes, vines, dates, oranges, lemons, figs, wheat, barley, maize, apricots, peaches and almonds.\n\n**Economy and environment**\n\nThe economy is based primarily on tourism, which makes up 32% of the GDP.

Neither was The Last Married Couple in America (1980) with Natalie Wood. Segal famously pulled out of the lead role in Blake Edwards' hit comedy 10 (1979), resulting in his being replaced by Dudley Moore and sued by Edwards.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nDespite this relatively dry period, Segal re-established himself as a successful character actor in the 1990s. He appeared in some less-acclaimed films, but he also worked with directors such as Mark Rydell, Gus Van Sant, Barbra Streisand, David O Russell, Randal Kleiser, and Ben Stiller, respectively, in well-received films such as For the Boys (1991), To Die For (1995), The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996), Flirting with Disaster (1996), It's My Party (1996), and The Cable Guy (1996). Segal also had guest appearances on various shows such as Murder She Wrote and The Larry Sanders Show and continued to appear in television films such as Seasons of the Heart (1994), Houdini (1998), and The Linda McCartney Story (2000). In 1999, he briefly performed in Yasmina Reza's Art on Broadway, and in 2001, he reprised his performance in the West End.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nSegal was married three times. He married film editor Marion Segal Freed in 1956, who would go on to work as an associate producer or editor on three of his films. They had two daughters and were together until their divorce in 1983. From 1983 until her death in 1996, he was married to Linda Rogoff, a one-time manager of The Pointer Sisters whom he met at Carnegie Hall when he played the banjo with his band. He married his former George School boarding school classmate Sonia Schultz Greenbaum in 1998.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Segal\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGeorge Segal Jr was born in New York City, [5] [6] [7] the youngest of four children, to Fannie Blanche Segal (née Bodkin) and George Segal Sr., a malt and hop agent He spent much of his childhood in Great Neck, New York [5] [8] [9] All four of Segal's grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants, [10] [11] and his maternal grandparents changed their surname from Slobodkin to Bodkin [10] A paternal great-grandfather ran for governor of Massachusetts as a socialist [12] His oldest brother, John, worked in the hops brokerage business and was an innovator in the cultivation of new hop varieties; he had a farm in Grandview, Washington where George often helped in the summers [13] The middle brother, Fred, was a screenwriter; [8] and his sister Greta died of pneumonia before Segal was born [10]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter college and the army, Segal eventually studied at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and at HB Studio with Uta Hagen [20] and got a job as an understudy in the 1956 off-Broadway production of The Iceman Cometh starring Jason Robards [21] He appeared in Antony and Cleopatra for Joseph Papp and joined an improvisational group called The Premise, which performed at a Bleecker Street coffeehouse [22] and whose ranks included Buck Henry and Theodore J Flicker [23] Segal continued to perform on Broadway with roles in Gideon (1961–62) by Paddy Chayefsky, which ran for 236 performances, [24] [25] as well as Rattle of a Simple Man (1963), an adaptation of a British hit, with Tammy Grimes and Edward Woodward.\n\n\nEarly roles and success\nAfter college and the army, Segal eventually studied at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and at HB Studio with Uta Hagen [20] and got a job as an understudy in the 1956 off-Broadway production of The Iceman Cometh starring Jason Robards [21] He appeared in Antony and Cleopatra for Joseph Papp and joined an improvisational group called The Premise, which performed at a Bleecker Street coffeehouse [22] and whose ranks included Buck Henry and Theodore J Flicker [23] Segal continued to perform on Broadway with roles in Gideon (1961–62) by Paddy Chayefsky, which ran for 236 performances, [24] [25] as well as Rattle of a Simple Man (1963), an adaptation of a British hit, with Tammy Grimes and Edward Woodward.\n\n\nCritical acclaim\nIn 1965, Segal played an egocentric painter in an ensemble cast led by Vivien Leigh and Lee Marvin in Stanley Kramer's acclaimed drama Ship of Fools, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture The same year, he also had the title role of a scheming POW in the well-regarded war drama King Rat (a role originally meant for Frank Sinatra) and received acclaim for both performances [32] [33] In other notable film appearances, he played a secret service agent on assignment in Berlin in The Quiller Memorandum (1966) (a role originally meant for Charlton Heston [34]), an Algerian paratrooper who becomes a leader of the FLN in Lost Command (1966), and a Cagney-esque gangster in Roger Corman's The St Valentine's Day Massacre (1967) [28]\n\n\nLeading man\nFor over ten years after his success with Woolf, Segal received many notable film roles, often working with major filmmakers and becoming a significant figure in the New Hollywood movement [43] He starred in Carl Reiner's celebrated [44] dark comedy [45] Where's Poppa?

M. Renfield. Renfield hopes to broker a land deal, and after proving to be a useful assistant, he ends up becoming Dracula's familiar. This grant of immortality and superhuman strength and speed comes with a condition: Renfield must consume bugs to sustain his powers. As Renfield becomes more and more entrenched in his new life, he begins to develop a strange and unsettling obsession with his master.\n\n**Cast**\n\nNicholas Hoult was cast as Renfield in August 2021. Nicolas Cage was cast to play Count Dracula in November, and Awkwafina and Ben Schwartz were added to the cast in December. Adrian Martinez, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Bess Rous, James Moses Black, Caroline Williams, and Brandon Scott Jones were confirmed to star in the film the following year.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn July 2014, Universal Pictures announced classic horror film properties, including the character of Count Dracula, as part of a unified shared universe with Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan attached to oversee its development. After the negative reception of Dracula Untold (2014), its connections to a unified series were downplayed, and The Mummy (2017) was re-positioned as the first film in the series. The Mummy, a critical and commercial failure, resulted in Universal's decision to shift its focus to individual storytelling and move away from the shared universe concept.\n\n**Casting**\n\nNicholas Hoult was cast as Renfield in August 2021. Nicolas Cage was cast to play Count Dracula in November, and Awkwafina and Ben Schwartz were added to the cast in December. Adrian Martinez, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Bess Rous, James Moses Black, Caroline Williams, and Brandon Scott Jones were confirmed to star in the film the following year.\n\n**Filming**\n\nFilming began in New Orleans on February 3, 2022, with Mitchell Amundsen serving as cinematographer. On February 8, more than twenty vehicles belonging to the production crew were burglarized. One security guard was present at the time of the incident, which occurred late at night in a secured parking lot. Crew member Elmo Peoples said the vandals had stolen his insurance papers, two bank cards, and a laptop. He added, \"I'm supposed to be here all week and I don't even want to come back because I feel like they don't really care about us as much as the main characters or actors.\" Love Bugs Film LLC reassured the production crew that they would hire additional security.\n\n**Release**\n\nRenfield had its world premiere at the Overlook Film Festival on March 30, 2023, and was released in US theaters on April 14, 2023, by Universal Pictures. The film was released on Blu-Ray and DVD in the US on June 6, 2023, and began streaming on Peacock June 9.\n\n**Video Game**\n\nRenfield: Bring Your Own Blood, a video game based on the film, was developed by Mega Cat Studios, published by Skybound Games and released on April 12, 2023, for Microsoft Windows. Renfield: Bring Your Own Blood is a bullet hell roguelike game.\n\n**Reception**\n\nRenfield grossed $17.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $9.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $26.9 million. It has been deemed a box office flop. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 58% of 301 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Although it fails to take full advantage of its committed stars and killer premise, Renfield's batty horror-comedy blend sinks in just enough to leave an impression.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it an 86% positive score.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nRenfield received a nomination for Best Comedy Poster at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. At the 51st Saturn Awards, it received 5 nominations, winning Best Supporting Actor for Nicolas Cage.\n\n**References**\n\nExternal links:", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Renfield_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn the early 20th century, Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula meets English lawyer R M Renfield Renfield hopes to broker a land deal, and after proving to be a useful assistant, he ends up becoming Dracula's familiar, which grants him immortality and super strength and speed when he consumes bugs.\n\n\nCast\nAdditionally, Helen Chandler and Edward Van Sloan respectively appear as Mina Seward and Van Helsing via archive footage from Dracula (1931) [7] [8] [9] [10]\n\n\nProduction\nIn July 2014, Universal Pictures announced classic horror film properties, including the character of Count Dracula, as part of a unified shared universe with Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan attached to oversee its development [11] After the negative reception of Dracula Untold (2014), its connections to a unified series were downplayed, and The Mummy (2017) was re-positioned as the first film in the series [12] [13] The Mummy, a critical and commercial failure, resulted in Universal's decision to shift its focus to individual storytelling and move away from the shared universe concept [14]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn July 2014, Universal Pictures announced classic horror film properties, including the character of Count Dracula, as part of a unified shared universe with Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan attached to oversee its development [11] After the negative reception of Dracula Untold (2014), its connections to a unified series were downplayed, and The Mummy (2017) was re-positioned as the first film in the series [12] [13] The Mummy, a critical and commercial failure, resulted in Universal's decision to shift its focus to individual storytelling and move away from the shared universe concept [14]\n\n\nCasting\nNicholas Hoult was cast as Renfield in August 2021 [21] Nicolas Cage was cast to play Count Dracula in November, [22] Awkwafina [23] and Ben Schwartz [24] were added to the cast in December, and Adrian Martinez, [25] Shohreh Aghdashloo, [26] Bess Rous, [27] James Moses Black, [28] Caroline Williams, [29] and Brandon Scott Jones were confirmed to star the following year [30] An \"enormous\" fan of Dracula and the source material, Cage prepared for his role by observing the distinctive ways Dracula was portrayed on screen by Bela Lugosi, Frank Langella, and Gary Oldman \"What can I bring that will be different?\", he said, \"I want it to pop in a unique way We've seen it played well, we've seen it play not so well, so what can we do?

B cells, also known as B lymphocytes, are responsible for producing antibodies that help to fight infections. However, when B cells become cancerous, they can cause a range of problems, from mild to severe.\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are numerous kinds of lymphomas involving B cells. The most commonly used classification system is the WHO classification, a convergence of more than one, older classification systems. This classification system helps to identify the specific type of B-cell lymphoma and its underlying causes.\n\n**Common B-cell Lymphomas**\n\nFive types of B-cell lymphomas account for nearly three out of four patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\n\n* **Follicular Lymphoma**: This is the most common type of B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 20-30% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Follicular lymphoma is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n* **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)**: This is the second most common type of B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30-40% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. DLBCL is a fast-growing type of lymphoma that can spread quickly to other parts of the body.\n* **Mantle Cell Lymphoma**: This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that accounts for approximately 5-10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Mantle cell lymphoma is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n* **Marginal Zone Lymphoma**: This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that accounts for approximately 5-10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Marginal zone lymphoma is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n* **Hairy Cell Leukemia**: This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that accounts for approximately 2-5% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the blood and bone marrow.\n\n**Rare B-cell Lymphomas**\n\nThe remaining forms of B-cell lymphoma are much less common and include:\n\n* **Burkitt's Lymphoma**: This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that accounts for approximately 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Burkitt's lymphoma is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n* **Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma**: This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that accounts for approximately 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n* **Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia**: This is a rare type of B-cell lymphoma that accounts for approximately 1-2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases. Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n\n**Other B-cell Lymphomas**\n\nAdditionally, some researchers separate out lymphomas that appear to result from other immune system disorders, such as AIDS-related lymphoma. AIDS-related lymphoma is a type of B-cell lymphoma that occurs in people with HIV/AIDS. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nWhen a person appears to have a B-cell lymphoma, the main components of a workup (for determining the appropriate therapy and the person's prognosis) are:\n\n* **Imaging studies**: These include CT scans, PET scans, and MRI scans to evaluate the extent of the disease.\n* **Biopsy**: A biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of tissue is removed from the affected area and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells.\n* **Blood tests**: Blood tests are used to evaluate the person's overall health and to monitor the disease.\n* **Bone marrow biopsy**: A bone marrow biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of bone marrow is removed from the affected area and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells.\n\n**Associated Chromosomal Translocations**\n\nChromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobulin heavy locus is a classic cytogenetic abnormality for many B-cell lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma. In these cases, the immunoglobulin heavy locus forms a fusion protein with another protein that has pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic abilities.

His life's work was marked by his unwavering dedication to helping others, despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLudwig Guttmann was born on 3 July 1899 to a German Jewish family in the town of Tost, Upper Silesia, in the former German Empire (now Toszek in southern Poland). His parents, Dorothy (née Weissenberg) and Bernard Guttmann, were a distiller and his wife, respectively. When Guttmann was three years old, the family moved to the Silesian city of Königshütte (today Chorzów, Poland), where he spent most of his childhood.\n\n**Escape to Britain**\n\nBy 1933, Guttmann was working as a neurosurgeon in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) and lecturing at the university. He was highly respected in his field, having learned from the pioneer of neurosurgery, Otfrid Foerster, at his research institute. Despite having worked successfully as first assistant to Foerster, Guttmann was expelled from his university appointment and his job in 1933 under the Nuremberg Laws. His title was changed to Krankenbehandler (one who treats the sick), and he was assigned to work at the Breslau Jewish Hospital.\n\nGuttmann's decision to stay in Germany, despite the increasingly hostile environment, was motivated by his commitment to his patients and his role as a medical director. Following the violent attacks on Jewish people and properties during Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938, Guttmann ordered his staff to admit any patients without question. The following day, he justified his decision on a case-by-case basis with the Gestapo. Out of 64 admissions, 60 patients were saved from arrest and deportation to concentration camps.\n\n**Stoke Mandeville and Paralympic Games**\n\nIn September 1943, the British government asked Guttmann to establish the National Spinal Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. The initiative came from the Royal Air Force to improve the treatment and rehabilitation of pilots with spine injuries, who often crashed on approach with their bombers damaged. When the centre opened on 1 February 1944, the United Kingdom's first specialist unit for treating spinal injuries, Guttmann was appointed its director, a position he held until 1966.\n\nGuttmann believed that sport was an important method of therapy for the rehabilitation of injured military personnel, helping them build up physical strength and self-respect. He organized the first international wheelchair sports competition, the Stoke Mandeville Games, which was held in 1952. The games were a huge success, and they paved the way for the modern Paralympic Games.\n\n**Later Life**\n\nGuttmann was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1950 King's Birthday Honours, as \"Neurological Surgeon in charge of the Spinal Injuries Centre at the Ministry of Pensions Hospital, Stoke Mandeville.\" On 28 June 1957, he was made an Associate Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John.\n\nGuttmann continued to work tirelessly in the fields of medicine and sports, advocating for the rights of people with disabilities. He was a pioneer in the development of rehabilitation medicine and a champion of the Paralympic movement.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nStoke Mandeville Stadium, the National Centre for Disability Sport in the United Kingdom, was developed by Guttmann alongside the hospital. The stadium has become a symbol of the Paralympic movement and a testament to Guttmann's dedication to helping others.\n\nGuttmann's legacy extends far beyond his work in medicine and sports. He was a true pioneer and a champion of human rights, and his commitment to helping others has inspired countless people around the world.\n\n**Selected Publications**\n\n* Guttmann, L.

Born in 1948 in Nazareth, Hadid is the son of a Palestinian Muslim family with a rich history dating back to the 18th century.\n\n## Early Life\n\nHadid was born into a Palestinian Muslim family in 1948 in Nazareth. His father, Anwar Mohamed Hadid, was a prominent figure in the community, and his mother, Khairiah Hadid (née Daher), claimed descent from Dahir al-Umar, an 18th-century Arab ruler of northern Palestine. Hadid has two brothers and five sisters, and his family's heritage is deeply rooted in Palestinian culture.\n\nGrowing up in a family with a strong sense of tradition and history, Hadid was exposed to the complexities of the Middle East from a young age. His family's Palestinian roots and his own experiences would later influence his entrepreneurial ventures and philanthropic efforts.\n\n## Career\n\nHadid's early career was marked by a series of entrepreneurial ventures that took him from the Middle East to the United States. He started by exporting equipment to the region before moving to Greece, where he opened a nightclub on an island. The profits from the nightclub enabled him to invest in real estate in the United States, a venture that would become a defining aspect of his career.\n\nHadid's real estate ventures took him to some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the country, including Bel Air, where he built a sprawling mansion that would become the subject of controversy. The Bel Air Homeowners Alliance, chaired by Fred Rosen, was formed to oppose the construction of the mansion, citing concerns about the impact on the community.\n\n## Estate on Strada Vecchia Road\n\nThe controversy surrounding Hadid's Bel Air estate was centered on the construction of a retaining wall that damaged the roots of a eucalyptus tree on a neighboring property. Nancy Walton Laurie, an heiress to the Walmart fortune and a Bel Air resident, filed a lawsuit against Hadid through her company, LW Partnership. The lawsuit accused Hadid of causing damage to Laurie's property and sought compensation for the alleged harm.\n\nThe lawsuit marked a turning point in the controversy surrounding Hadid's Bel Air estate, with many in the community calling for greater regulation of large-scale development projects. The incident highlighted the tensions between economic development and environmental concerns, a debate that continues to shape the conversation around real estate and urban planning.\n\n## Athletic Career\n\nHadid's athletic career was marked by a single appearance in the Winter Olympics, where he competed in the demonstration sport of speed skiing. Representing Jordan, Hadid was 43 years old at the time of his Olympic debut, a remarkable achievement for any athlete. He was encouraged to participate by his friend, Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber, who saw potential in Hadid's speed skiing abilities.\n\nHadid's Olympic appearance marked a unique moment in Jordanian sporting history, as he became the country's first and only Winter Olympian. The experience would likely have been a challenging and rewarding experience for Hadid, who had to balance his athletic ambitions with the demands of his business career.\n\n## Television Appearances\n\nHadid has appeared on several reality TV shows, including The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, where he was featured as the ex-husband of Yolanda Hadid. He has also appeared on Shahs of Sunset and Second Wives Club on E!, where he was joined by his fiancée, Shiva Safai, in 2017.\n\nHadid's appearances on reality TV have provided a glimpse into his personal life and relationships, as well as his business ventures and philanthropic efforts. While some have criticized his involvement in reality TV, Hadid's appearances have likely helped to raise his profile and increase his visibility.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nHadid's personal life has been marked by a series of high-profile relationships and marriages. His first marriage was to Mary Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Alana Hadid and Marielle Hadid. The couple ended their marriage in 1992, a decision that would likely have had a lasting impact on Hadid's personal and professional life.\n\nHadid's relationships and marriages have often been the subject of media attention, with some critics accusing him of being a serial monogamist or a ladies' man. While Hadid's personal life has likely been influenced by his celebrity status and business ventures, his relationships and marriages have also provided a glimpse into his personal values and priorities.\n\nIn conclusion, Mohamed Hadid is a complex and multifaceted individual with a rich history and diverse interests. From his early life in Nazareth to his high-profile real estate ventures and reality TV appearances, Hadid has navigated a range of challenges and opportunities that have shaped his career and personal life. As a business leader, athlete, and philanthropist, Hadid continues to be a prominent figure in the Middle East and beyond.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mohamed_Hadid\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHadid was born into a Palestinian Muslim family [4] [5] [6] in 1948 [7] in Nazareth [2] He is the son of Anwar Mohamed Hadid (1918 [8]–1989 [9]) and his wife Khairiah Hadid (née Daher; 1925–2008), [10] and has two brothers and five sisters [9] Through his mother, Hadid claims descent from Dahir al-Umar, an 18th-century Arab ruler of northern Palestine [11] [12]\n\n\nCareer\nAmong his early ventures was a company that exported equipment to the Middle East [7] [17] He started his career restoring and reselling classic cars in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington, D.C., before moving to Greece, where he opened a nightclub on an island, and with the profits, started developing real estate in the United States [18]\n\n\nEstate on Strada Vecchia Road\nShortly after Hadid received approval for the construction of a mansion in Bel Air, the Bel Air Homeowners Alliance, chaired by Fred Rosen, was formed to oppose it [21] In January 2015, Nancy Walton Laurie, an heiress to the Walmart fortune and a Bel Air resident, filed a lawsuit through her company, LW Partnership, against Hadid [23] Laurie accused Hadid of damaging the roots of a eucalyptus tree on her property with a retaining wall he built next to her house [23]\n\n\nAthletic career\nHadid competed in the demonstration sport of speed skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics, representing Jordan He was 43 years old at the time Hadid was encouraged to participate by his friend, Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber Hadid was the only member of the Jordanian delegation, [2] and remains the only person to have represented Jordan in the Winter Olympics [30] [31]\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nHadid has appeared on the TV show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, as the ex-husband of Yolanda Hadid [22] He has also appeared on Shahs of Sunset, [21] and Second Wives Club on E! with his fiancée Shiva Safai in 2017 [32]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHadid's first marriage was with Mary Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Alana Hadid and Marielle Hadid He and Butler ended their marriage in 1992 [33] [34]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was read his Miranda rights at his bedside by a federal magistrate judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, nodded his head to answer the judge's questions, and

{"title": "Hussein_of_Jordan", "content": "\nEarly life\nHussein was born at Al-Qasr Al-Sagheer at Raghadan Palace in Amman on 14 November 1935 to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein al-Sharaf [1] [2] He was the eldest among his siblings, three brothers and two sisters – Princess Asma, Prince Muhammad, Prince Hassan, Prince Muhsin, and Princess Basma [3] During one cold Ammani winter, his baby sister Princess Asma died from pneumonia, an indication of how poor his family was then – they could not afford heating in their house [3]\n\n\nReign\nAbdullah's eldest son, Talal, was proclaimed King of Jordan [11] Talal appointed his son Hussein as crown prince on 9 September 1951 [11] After a reign lasting less than thirteen months, the Parliament forced King Talal to abdicate due to his mental state – doctors had diagnosed schizophrenia [11] In his brief reign, Talal had introduced a modern, somewhat liberal constitution in 1952 that is still in use today [11] Hussein was proclaimed king on 11 August 1952, succeeding to the throne three months before his 17th birthday [11] A telegram from Jordan was brought in to Hussein while he was staying with his mother abroad in Lausanne, Switzerland, addressed to 'His Majesty King Hussein' [11] \"I did not need to open it to know that my days as a schoolboy were over,\" Hussein later wrote in his memoirs [11] He returned home to cheering crowds [11]\n\n\nAccession\nAbdullah's eldest son, Talal, was proclaimed King of Jordan [11] Talal appointed his son Hussein as crown prince on 9 September 1951 [11] After a reign lasting less than thirteen months, the Parliament forced King Talal to abdicate due to his mental state – doctors had diagnosed schizophrenia [11] In his brief reign, Talal had introduced a modern, somewhat liberal constitution in 1952 that is still in use today [11] Hussein was proclaimed king on 11 August 1952, succeeding to the throne three months before his 17th birthday [11] A telegram from Jordan was brought in to Hussein while he was staying with his mother abroad in Lausanne, Switzerland, addressed to 'His Majesty King Hussein' [11] \"I did not need to open it to know that my days as a schoolboy were over,\" Hussein later wrote in his memoirs [11] He returned home to cheering crowds [11]\n\n\nFirst years\nThe teenaged king inherited the throne not only of Jordan, but also of the West Bank, captured by Jordan during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and annexed in 1950 [11] The country was poor in natural resources, and had a large Palestinian refugee population resulting from the war – the annexation of the West Bank had made Palestinians two-thirds of the population, outnumbering Jordanians [11] Upon assuming the throne, he appointed Fawzi Mulki as prime minister [11] Mulki's liberal policies, including freedom of the press, led to unrest as opposition groups started a propaganda campaign against the monarchy [13] Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers) used Jordanian-controlled territory to launch attacks against Israel, sometimes provoking heavy retaliation [11] One reprisal operation by Israel became known as the Qibya massacre; it resulted in the death of 66 civilians in the West Bank village of Qibya [11] The incident led to protests, and in 1954 Hussein dismissed Mulki amid the unrest and appointed staunch royalist Tawfik Abu Al-Huda [11] The country held parliamentary elections in October 1954, while the country's parties were not yet fully organized [11] Abu Al-Huda lasted only a year, and the government underwent reshuffling three times within the following year [11]\n\n\n\"A liberal experiment\"\nEgyptian president Nasser received an outpouring of support from the Arab public after the Egyptian–Czechoslovak arms deal was signed in September 1955, [14] and his popularity in Jordan skyrocketed following the nationalization of the Suez Canal in July 1956; his actions were seen as a powerful stance against Western imperialism [14] Hussein was also supportive of the moves [14] The coinciding events in Egypt had Jordanian leftist opposition parties leaning greatly towards Nasser [14]\n\n\nArab Federation between Iraq and Jordan\n\nThe 1950s became known as the Arab Cold War, due to the conflict between states led by Nasserist Egypt and traditionalist kingdoms led by Saudi Arabia [21] Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic (UAR) on 1 February 1958, with the Republic's presidency occupied by Nasser [21] As a counterweight, Hussein and his cousin, King Faisal II of Hashemite Iraq, established the Arab Federation on 14 February 1958 in an Amman ceremony [21] The two rival entities launched propaganda wars against each other through their radio broadcasts [21] Jordanian and Syrian forces clashed in March along the border [21] UAR-inspired conspiracies started to emerge against the Hashemite federation [22] An officer in Jordan was arrested for plotting to assassinate Hussein [21] It also emerged in Jordan that the UAR was planning to overthrow both Hashemite monarchies in July 1958 [21] Jordan reacted by arresting 40 suspected army officers, and Hussein called in Iraqi army chief of staff Rafiq Aref to brief him on the exposed plot [21] Aref replied, \"You look after yourselves Iraq is a very stable country, unlike Jordan If there are any worries it is Jordan that should be worried.\" [21] Although Faisal and Hussein enjoyed a very close relationship, Faisal's Iraqi entourage looked down on Jordan; Hussein attributed this attitude to Iraqi crown prince 'Abd al-Ilah's influence [21]\n\nAssassination attempts\nHazza' Majali was appointed by Hussein to form a government; it consisted of loyalists who had persuaded Hussein to launch an offensive against the Iraqi government to restore the Hashemite monarchy [27] The expedition was cancelled amid British opposition and the weakened state of the Royal Jordanian Air Force [27] UAR agents assassinated Prime Minister Majali with a bomb planted in his office Twenty minutes later, another explosion went off; [27] it was intended for Hussein as it was expected he would run to the scene, which he did – he was a few minutes late [27] Hussein, persuaded by Habis Majali, Hazza's cousin and the army chief of staff, prepared for a retaliation against Syria, whose intelligence service was responsible for the assassination [27] He prepared three brigades in the north, but the operation was called off after combined pressures from the Americans and the British [27] Egyptian radios denounced Hussein as the \"Judas of the Arabs.\" [27]\n\nSamu Incident\nHussein later stated that during one of his meetings with Israeli representatives: \"I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one.\" [29] The Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah started organizing cross-border attacks against Israel in January 1965, often drawing Israeli reprisals on Jordan [30] One such reprisal was the Samu Incident, an attack launched by Israel on 13 November 1966 on the Jordanian-controlled West Bank town of As-Samu after three Israeli soldiers were killed by a Fatah landmine [31] The assault inflicted heavy Arab casualties [31] Israeli writer Avi Shlaim argues that Israel's disproportionate retaliation exacted revenge on the wrong party, as Israeli leaders knew from their coordination with Hussein that he was doing everything he could to prevent such attacks [31] The incident drew fierce local criticism of Hussein amid feelings he had been betrayed by the Israelis; Hussein also suspected that Israel had changed its attitude towards Jordan and had intended to escalate matters in order to capture the West Bank [31] Yitzhak Rabin, the then Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, later admitted the disproportionate reaction by Israel, and that the operation would have been better directed at Syria, which was supporting such attacks: \"We had neither political nor military reasons to arrive at a confrontation with Jordan or to humiliate Hussein.\" [31]\n\n\nSix-Day War\nOn 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War began after an Israeli strike wiped out Egypt's Air Force [36] The Egyptian army commander in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that Israel's Air Force was almost wiped out [36] Based on the misleading information from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around Jerusalem [36] Jordanian Hawker Hunters made sorties but were destroyed by Israel when they went to refuel; Syria's and Iraq's air forces followed [36] Israel's air superiority on the first day of war proved decisive [36] Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein's office in the royal palace [36] Hussein was not there, the CIA station chief in Amman Jack O'Connell relayed a message threatening the Israelis, and the attempts stopped [36] The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander insisted to build his strategy based on the misleading information from Egypt [36]\n\n\nBlack September\nAfter Jordan lost control of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinian fighters known as \"fedayeen\", meaning self-sacrificers, moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli occupied territories [39] One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full-scale battle [39] It is believed that Israel had wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support for the PLO [40] After failing to capture Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, Israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed, but not before destroying the Karameh camp [41] and sustaining relatively high casualties [42]\n\n\nYom Kippur War\n\nAfter the 1967 war, Gunnar Jarring was appointed by the UN as a special envoy for the Middle East peace process, leading the Jarring Mission [45] The talks between Arab countries and Israel resulted in a deadlock [45] The stalemate led to renewed fears of another war between Arab countries and Israel [46] Worried that Jordan would be dragged into another war unprepared, Hussein sent Zaid Al-Rifai to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in December 1972 to inquire [46] Sadat informed Al-Rifai that he had been planning a limited incursion in the Sinai that would allow some political manoeuvring [46] Sadat then invited Al-Rifai and Hussein to a summit on 10 September 1973 with him and Hafez Al-Assad, who had become president of Syria [46] The summit ended with a restoration of ties between Jordan, Egypt, and Syria [46] Sadat disclosed to Assad and Hussein his intention to initiate military action [46] Hussein refused Sadat's request to allow the fedayeen's return to Jordan but agreed that in case of a military operation, Jordanian troops would play a limited defensive role in assisting the Syrians in the Golan Heights [46]\n\nInvolvement in peace initiatives\nWhen the PLO moved to Lebanon from Jordan after 1970, repeated attacks and counter-attacks occurred in southern Lebanon between the PLO and Israel [51] Two major Israeli incursions into Lebanon occurred in 1978, and the other in 1982, the latter conflict troubled Hussein as the IDF had laid siege to Beirut [51] The PLO was to be expelled from Lebanon, and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defense minister, suggested they be moved to Jordan where the monarchy would be toppled and Jordan would serve as an \"alternative Palestinian homeland.\" [51] Sharon boasted: \"One speech by me will make King Hussein realize that the time has come to pack his bags.\" [51] However, Arafat rejected Sharon's suggestion, and the fedayeen were transported to Tunisia under American cover [51]\n\n\nDisengagement from West Bank\nOn 9 December 1987 an Israeli truck driver ran over four Palestinians in a Gaza refugee camp, sparking unrest that spread to violent demonstrations in the West Bank [54] What began as an uprising to achieve Palestinian independence against the Israeli occupation turned into an upsurge of support for the PLO, which had orchestrated the uprising, and consequently diminished Jordanian influence in the West Bank [54] Jordanian policy on the West Bank had to be reconsidered following renewed fears that Israel would revive its proposal for Jordan to become an \"alternative Palestinian homeland.\" [54] US Secretary of State George P Shultz set up a peace process that became known as the Schulz Initiative [54] It called for Jordan rather than the PLO to represent the Palestinians; however, when Schultz contacted Hussein about the plan, he reversed his position and told him it was a matter for the PLO to decide [54]\n\n\n1989 riots\nJordan's disengagement from the West Bank led to a slowing of the Jordanian economy [57] The Jordanian dinar lost a third of its value in 1988, and Jordan's foreign debt reached a figure double that of its gross national product (GNP) [57] Jordan introduced austerity measures to combat the economic crisis [58] On 16 April 1989 the government increased prices of gasoline, licensing fees, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes, between 15% and 50%, in a bid to increase revenues in accordance with an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [58] The IMF agreement was to enable Jordan to reschedule its $6 billion debt, and obtain loans totaling $275 million over 18 months [58] On 18 April riots in Ma'an spread to other southern towns such as Al-Karak and Tafila, where the New York Times reported that around 4,000 people gathered in the streets and clashed with the police, [58] resulting in six protesters killed and 42 injured, and two policemen killed and 47 injured [59]\n\n\nGulf War\nA UN-brokered ceasefire became active in July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war [61] Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his image in the West by visiting other countries, and by appearing at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail [62] The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16 February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council [62] Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in what became known as the Gulf War [62] Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam's [62] After informing the American president George H W Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, [62] Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3 August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved [62] On Hussein's way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion [62] To Hussein's dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait [62] An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan's foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein's efforts to reach a peaceful resolution [62] Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia viewed Hussein with suspicion – they distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait's wealth [62]\n\n\nPeace with Israel\nPeace demands no less courage than war It is the courage to meet the adversary, his attitudes and arguments, the courage to face hardships, the courage to bury senseless illusions, the courage to surmount impeding obstacles, the courage to engage in a dialogue to tear down the walls of fear and suspicion It is the courage to face reality.\n\n\nTensions with Israel\nHussein's support for Netanyahu soon backfired [69] Israel's actions during the 1996 Qana massacre in Southern Lebanon, the Likud government's decision to build settlements in East Jerusalem, and the events at the Temple Mount where clashes between Palestinian and Israeli police ensued after Israeli tunnel diggings around the Mount, generated an uproar of criticism for Netanyahu in the Arab World [69] On 9 March 1997 Hussein sent Netanyahu a three-page letter expressing his disappointment [69] The King lambasted Netanyahu, with the letter's opening sentence stating: \"My distress is genuine and deep over the accumulating tragic actions which you have initiated at the head of the Government of Israel, making peace – the worthiest objective of my life – appear more and more like a distant elusive mirage.\" [70]\n\n\nIllness, death and funeral\nIn May 1998 Hussein, a heavy smoker, was admitted to the Mayo Clinic, but doctors were unable to diagnose his ailment [73] Hussein returned to the clinic in July after suffering severe fevers; doctors then diagnosed him with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma [73] He stayed in the clinic until the end of 1998, while his brother Hassan, who had been crown prince since 1965, acted as regent [73] He was given six courses of chemotherapy for his lymph gland cancer over a five-month period [73] Hussein gained the respect of the Mayo Clinic staff for his warmth and kindness; on one occasion, a janitor cried uncontrollably after Hussein prepared a birthday party for her in his suite [74]\n\n\nLegacy\nAll what we hope for is that a day will come, when we have all gone, when people will say that this man has tried, and his family tried This is all there is to seek in this world.\n\n\nImage\nAll what we hope for is that a day will come, when we have all gone, when people will say that this man has tried, and his family tried This is all there is to seek in this world.\n\n\nCriticism\nThe King disliked paperwork, and had no solid view for the economy [87] He was dubbed the \"fundraiser-in-chief\": throughout his reign he managed to obtain foreign aid from different sources, leaving a legacy of a foreign aid-dependent Jordan [87] British aid in the early 1950s, American aid from 1957 onwards, Gulf aid in the 1960s and 1970s, Arab League and Iraqi aid in the early 1980s, and, after formalizing peace with Israel, American aid in the 1990s [87]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKing Hussein was less than seventeen years old, and unmarried, when he came to the throne of Jordan in 1952 He married four times He had eleven acknowledged children, and one alleged illegitimate child His wives and children were:\n\n\nMarriages and issue\nKing Hussein was less than seventeen years old, and unmarried, when he came to the throne of Jordan in 1952 He married four times He had eleven acknowledged children, and one alleged illegitimate child His wives and children were:\n\n\nInterests\nHussein was an enthusiastic ham radio operator and an Honorary Member of The Radio Society of Harrow and a life member of the American Radio Relay League [100] He was popular in the amateur radio community and insisted that fellow operators refer to him without his title [101] His call sign was JY1, which inspired the name for Jordan's first cube-sat satellite, the JY1-SAT, which was launched in 2018 [102]\n\n\nMilitary ranks\nKing Hussein I bin Talal I held the following ranks:\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\n\nWritings\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**King Hussein of Jordan**\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKing Hussein I bin Talal I was born on 14 November 1935 at Al-Qasr Al-Sagheer at Raghadan Palace in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. He was the eldest among his siblings, with three brothers and two sisters, including Princess Asma, Prince Muhammad, Prince Hassan, Prince Muhsin, and Princess Basma. His parents were Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein al-Sharaf.\n\nHussein's early life was marked by financial difficulties, and his family struggled to afford basic necessities. During one particularly harsh winter, his baby sister Princess Asma died from pneumonia, highlighting the family's poverty. Despite these challenges, Hussein's father, Talal, was determined to provide a better life for his children and worked tirelessly to improve their circumstances.\n\n**Reign**\n\nAbdullah's eldest son, Talal, was proclaimed King of Jordan in 1951, marking the beginning of a new era for the country. Talal appointed his son Hussein as crown prince on 9 September 1951, ensuring a smooth transition of power. However, Talal's reign was cut short due to his mental health issues, and he was forced to abdicate after less than thirteen months.\n\nIn his brief reign, Talal introduced a modern constitution in 1952, which remains in use today. Hussein was proclaimed king on 11 August 1952, just three months before his 17th birthday. He was informed of his accession to the throne through a telegram addressed to \"His Majesty King Hussein,\" which he received while staying with his mother abroad in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\n**Accession**\n\nHussein's ascension to the throne marked the beginning of a long and eventful reign. At just 17 years old, he faced significant challenges, including the annexation of the West Bank during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent influx of Palestinian refugees.\n\nThe country's economy was also in a state of flux, with limited natural resources and a large refugee population. Hussein's first move as king was to appoint Fawzi Mulki as prime minister, who introduced liberal policies, including freedom of the press. However, these policies led to unrest, and opposition groups began to organize against the monarchy.\n\n**First Years**\n\nThe early years of Hussein's reign were marked by significant events, including the Qibya massacre, in which 66 civilians were killed in the West Bank village of Qibya. The incident led to widespread protests, and Hussein was forced to dismiss Mulki and appoint a new prime minister, Tawfik Abu Al-Huda.\n\nThe country held parliamentary elections in 1954, but the results were not decisive, and the government underwent several reshuffles within the next year. Hussein's relationship with Egypt's president Nasser was also significant, with Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956 drawing widespread support from the Arab public.\n\n**Arab Federation between Iraq and Jordan**\n\nThe 1950s became known as the Arab Cold War, with a conflict between states led by Nasserist Egypt and traditionalist kingdoms led by Saudi Arabia. As a counterweight to Egypt's influence, Hussein and his cousin, King Faisal II of Hashemite Iraq, established the Arab Federation on 14 February 1958.\n\nThe two rival entities launched propaganda wars against each other through their radio broadcasts, and Jordanian and Syrian forces clashed along the border in March 1958. UAR-inspired conspiracies emerged against the Hashemite federation, and an officer in Jordan was arrested for plotting to assassinate Hussein.\n\n**Assassination Attempts**\n\nHussein was targeted by several assassination attempts, including a plot to kill him with a bomb planted in his office. The attempt was foiled, but it highlighted the risks and challenges faced by the monarch.\n\n**Samu Incident**\n\nThe Samu Incident, in which Israeli forces attacked the Jordanian-controlled West Bank town of As-Samu, drew widespread criticism of Hussein. The incident had far-reaching consequences, including a deterioration in relationships between Jordan and Israel.\n\n**Six-Day War**\n\nThe Six-Day War, which began on 5 June 1967, marked a significant turning point in Hussein's reign. The war resulted in a decisive victory for Israel, and the Jordanian army was badly defeated.\n\n**Black September**\n\nThe Black September events, which began in 1969, marked a significant deterioration in relationships between Jordan and the Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah. The conflict resulted in the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from Jordan.\n\n**Yom Kippur War**\n\nThe Yom Kippur War, which began on 6 October 1973, marked a significant escalation of tensions in the region. Hussein played a key role in the war, and Jordanian forces played a limited defensive role in assisting the Syrians in the Golan Heights.\n\n**Involvement in Peace Initiatives**\n\nHussein was involved in several peace initiatives, including the Jarring Mission, which aimed to establish a lasting peace in the region. However, the talks remained stalled, and the conflict continued.\n\n**Disengagement from West Bank**\n\nThe 1987 uprising in the West Bank marked a significant turning point in Jordan's relationship with the Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah. The uprising led to a decline in Jordanian influence in the West Bank.\n\n**1989 Riots**\n\nThe 1989 riots in Jordan marked a significant deterioration in the country's economy and social stability. The riots resulted in the deaths of several protesters and police officers.\n\n**Gulf War**\n\nThe Gulf War, which began on 17 January 1991, marked a significant escalation of tensions in the region. Jordan played a key role in the war, and the country's relationship with Iraq deteriorated significantly.\n\n**Peace with Israel**\n\nHussein's relationship with Israel was complex and marked by significant tensions. However, in 1994, Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty, marking a significant turning point in the region.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nHussein's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He played a significant role in the region, and his reign was marked by significant events, including the Arab Cold War, the Six-Day War, and the Gulf War.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHussein married four times and had eleven acknowledged children. He was a devoted father and husband, and his personal life was marked by significant events, including the marriage of his daughter, Princess Alia.\n\n**Interests**\n\nHussein was an enthusiastic ham radio operator and an Honorary Member of The Radio Society of Harrow. He was popular in the amateur radio community and insisted that fellow operators refer to him without his title.\n\n**Military Ranks**\n\nHussein held the following military ranks:\n\n* General of the Army\n* Air Marshal\n* Admiral\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nHussein's ancestry is complex and multifaceted. He was a member of the Hashemite dynasty, which ruled Jordan from 1921 to 1952.\n\n**Writings**\n\nHussein wrote several books, including \"Uneasy Lies the Head\" and \"No End of a Lesson.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\n* King Talal of Jordan\n* King Faisal II of Iraq\n* Arab Cold War\n* Six-Day War\n* Gulf War\n* Jordan-Palestine conflict\n\n**References**\n\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan: A Life in Pictures.\" BBC News. 7 February 1999.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan.\" The Guardian. 7 February 1999.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan: A Life in Photos.\" The New York Times. 7 February 1999.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \"Uneasy Lies the Head.\" King Hussein of Jordan. 1994.\n* \"No End of a Lesson.\" King Hussein of Jordan. 1994.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan: A Life in Pictures.\" BBC News. 1999.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan.\" The Guardian. 1999.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan: A Life in Photos.\" The New York Times. 1999.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan.\" BBC News.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan.\" The Guardian.\n* \"King Hussein of Jordan: A Life in Photos.\" The New York Times.\n* \"Jordan Royal Family.\" Jordan Times.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hussein_of_Jordan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHussein was born at Al-Qasr Al-Sagheer at Raghadan Palace in Amman on 14 November 1935 to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein al-Sharaf [1] [2] He was the eldest among his siblings, three brothers and two sisters – Princess Asma, Prince Muhammad, Prince Hassan, Prince Muhsin, and Princess Basma [3] During one cold Ammani winter, his baby sister Princess Asma died from pneumonia, an indication of how poor his family was then – they could not afford heating in their house [3]\n\n\nReign\nAbdullah's eldest son, Talal, was proclaimed King of Jordan [11] Talal appointed his son Hussein as crown prince on 9 September 1951 [11] After a reign lasting less than thirteen months, the Parliament forced King Talal to abdicate due to his mental state – doctors had diagnosed schizophrenia [11] In his brief reign, Talal had introduced a modern, somewhat liberal constitution in 1952 that is still in use today [11] Hussein was proclaimed king on 11 August 1952, succeeding to the throne three months before his 17th birthday [11] A telegram from Jordan was brought in to Hussein while he was staying with his mother abroad in Lausanne, Switzerland, addressed to 'His Majesty King Hussein' [11] \"I did not need to open it to know that my days as a schoolboy were over,\" Hussein later wrote in his memoirs [11] He returned home to cheering crowds [11]\n\n\nAccession\nAbdullah's eldest son, Talal, was proclaimed King of Jordan [11] Talal appointed his son Hussein as crown prince on 9 September 1951 [11] After a reign lasting less than thirteen months, the Parliament forced King Talal to abdicate due to his mental state – doctors had diagnosed schizophrenia [11] In his brief reign, Talal had introduced a modern, somewhat liberal constitution in 1952 that is still in use today [11] Hussein was proclaimed king on 11 August 1952, succeeding to the throne three months before his 17th birthday [11] A telegram from Jordan was brought in to Hussein while he was staying with his mother abroad in Lausanne, Switzerland, addressed to 'His Majesty King Hussein' [11] \"I did not need to open it to know that my days as a schoolboy were over,\" Hussein later wrote in his memoirs [11] He returned home to cheering crowds [11]\n\n\nFirst years\nThe teenaged king inherited the throne not only of Jordan, but also of the West Bank, captured by Jordan during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and annexed in 1950 [11] The country was poor in natural resources, and had a large Palestinian refugee population resulting from the war – the annexation of the West Bank had made Palestinians two-thirds of the population, outnumbering Jordanians [11] Upon assuming the throne, he appointed Fawzi Mulki as prime minister [11] Mulki's liberal policies, including freedom of the press, led to unrest as opposition groups started a propaganda campaign against the monarchy [13] Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers) used Jordanian-controlled territory to launch attacks against Israel, sometimes provoking heavy retaliation [11] One reprisal operation by Israel became known as the Qibya massacre; it resulted in the death of 66 civilians in the West Bank village of Qibya [11] The incident led to protests, and in 1954 Hussein dismissed Mulki amid the unrest and appointed staunch royalist Tawfik Abu Al-Huda [11] The country held parliamentary elections in October 1954, while the country's parties were not yet fully organized [11] Abu Al-Huda lasted only a year, and the government underwent reshuffling three times within the following year [11]\n\n\n\"A liberal experiment\"\nEgyptian president Nasser received an outpouring of support from the Arab public after the Egyptian–Czechoslovak arms deal was signed in September 1955, [14] and his popularity in Jordan skyrocketed following the nationalization of the Suez Canal in July 1956; his actions were seen as a powerful stance against Western imperialism [14] Hussein was also supportive of the moves [14] The coinciding events in Egypt had Jordanian leftist opposition parties leaning greatly towards Nasser [14]\n\n\nArab Federation between Iraq and Jordan\n\nThe 1950s became known as the Arab Cold War, due to the conflict between states led by Nasserist Egypt and traditionalist kingdoms led by Saudi Arabia [21] Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic (UAR) on 1 February 1958, with the Republic's presidency occupied by Nasser [21] As a counterweight, Hussein and his cousin, King Faisal II of Hashemite Iraq, established the Arab Federation on 14 February 1958 in an Amman ceremony [21] The two rival entities launched propaganda wars against each other through their radio broadcasts [21] Jordanian and Syrian forces clashed in March along the border [21] UAR-inspired conspiracies started to emerge against the Hashemite federation [22] An officer in Jordan was arrested for plotting to assassinate Hussein [21] It also emerged in Jordan that the UAR was planning to overthrow both Hashemite monarchies in July 1958 [21] Jordan reacted by arresting 40 suspected army officers, and Hussein called in Iraqi army chief of staff Rafiq Aref to brief him on the exposed plot [21] Aref replied, \"You look after yourselves Iraq is a very stable country, unlike Jordan If there are any worries it is Jordan that should be worried.\" [21] Although Faisal and Hussein enjoyed a very close relationship, Faisal's Iraqi entourage looked down on Jordan; Hussein attributed this attitude to Iraqi crown prince 'Abd al-Ilah's influence [21]\n\nAssassination attempts\nHazza' Majali was appointed by Hussein to form a government; it consisted of loyalists who had persuaded Hussein to launch an offensive against the Iraqi government to restore the Hashemite monarchy [27] The expedition was cancelled amid British opposition and the weakened state of the Royal Jordanian Air Force [27] UAR agents assassinated Prime Minister Majali with a bomb planted in his office Twenty minutes later, another explosion went off; [27] it was intended for Hussein as it was expected he would run to the scene, which he did – he was a few minutes late [27] Hussein, persuaded by Habis Majali, Hazza's cousin and the army chief of staff, prepared for a retaliation against Syria, whose intelligence service was responsible for the assassination [27] He prepared three brigades in the north, but the operation was called off after combined pressures from the Americans and the British [27] Egyptian radios denounced Hussein as the \"Judas of the Arabs.\" [27]\n\nSamu Incident\nHussein later stated that during one of his meetings with Israeli representatives: \"I told them I could not absorb a serious retaliatory raid, and they accepted the logic of this and promised there would never be one.\" [29] The Palestinian nationalist organization Fatah started organizing cross-border attacks against Israel in January 1965, often drawing Israeli reprisals on Jordan [30] One such reprisal was the Samu Incident, an attack launched by Israel on 13 November 1966 on the Jordanian-controlled West Bank town of As-Samu after three Israeli soldiers were killed by a Fatah landmine [31] The assault inflicted heavy Arab casualties [31] Israeli writer Avi Shlaim argues that Israel's disproportionate retaliation exacted revenge on the wrong party, as Israeli leaders knew from their coordination with Hussein that he was doing everything he could to prevent such attacks [31] The incident drew fierce local criticism of Hussein amid feelings he had been betrayed by the Israelis; Hussein also suspected that Israel had changed its attitude towards Jordan and had intended to escalate matters in order to capture the West Bank [31] Yitzhak Rabin, the then Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, later admitted the disproportionate reaction by Israel, and that the operation would have been better directed at Syria, which was supporting such attacks: \"We had neither political nor military reasons to arrive at a confrontation with Jordan or to humiliate Hussein.\" [31]\n\n\nSix-Day War\nOn 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War began after an Israeli strike wiped out Egypt's Air Force [36] The Egyptian army commander in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that Israel's Air Force was almost wiped out [36] Based on the misleading information from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around Jerusalem [36] Jordanian Hawker Hunters made sorties but were destroyed by Israel when they went to refuel; Syria's and Iraq's air forces followed [36] Israel's air superiority on the first day of war proved decisive [36] Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein's office in the royal palace [36] Hussein was not there, the CIA station chief in Amman Jack O'Connell relayed a message threatening the Israelis, and the attempts stopped [36] The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander insisted to build his strategy based on the misleading information from Egypt [36]\n\n\nBlack September\nAfter Jordan lost control of the West Bank in 1967, Palestinian fighters known as \"fedayeen\", meaning self-sacrificers, moved their bases to Jordan and stepped up their attacks on Israel and Israeli occupied territories [39] One Israeli retaliation on a PLO camp based in Karameh, a Jordanian town along the border with the West Bank, developed into a full-scale battle [39] It is believed that Israel had wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support for the PLO [40] After failing to capture Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader, Israeli forces withdrew or were repulsed, but not before destroying the Karameh camp [41] and sustaining relatively high casualties [42]\n\n\nYom Kippur War\n\nAfter the 1967 war, Gunnar Jarring was appointed by the UN as a special envoy for the Middle East peace process, leading the Jarring Mission [45] The talks between Arab countries and Israel resulted in a deadlock [45] The stalemate led to renewed fears of another war between Arab countries and Israel [46] Worried that Jordan would be dragged into another war unprepared, Hussein sent Zaid Al-Rifai to Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in December 1972 to inquire [46] Sadat informed Al-Rifai that he had been planning a limited incursion in the Sinai that would allow some political manoeuvring [46] Sadat then invited Al-Rifai and Hussein to a summit on 10 September 1973 with him and Hafez Al-Assad, who had become president of Syria [46] The summit ended with a restoration of ties between Jordan, Egypt, and Syria [46] Sadat disclosed to Assad and Hussein his intention to initiate military action [46] Hussein refused Sadat's request to allow the fedayeen's return to Jordan but agreed that in case of a military operation, Jordanian troops would play a limited defensive role in assisting the Syrians in the Golan Heights [46]\n\nInvolvement in peace initiatives\nWhen the PLO moved to Lebanon from Jordan after 1970, repeated attacks and counter-attacks occurred in southern Lebanon between the PLO and Israel [51] Two major Israeli incursions into Lebanon occurred in 1978, and the other in 1982, the latter conflict troubled Hussein as the IDF had laid siege to Beirut [51] The PLO was to be expelled from Lebanon, and Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Defense minister, suggested they be moved to Jordan where the monarchy would be toppled and Jordan would serve as an \"alternative Palestinian homeland.\" [51] Sharon boasted: \"One speech by me will make King Hussein realize that the time has come to pack his bags.\" [51] However, Arafat rejected Sharon's suggestion, and the fedayeen were transported to Tunisia under American cover [51]\n\n\nDisengagement from West Bank\nOn 9 December 1987 an Israeli truck driver ran over four Palestinians in a Gaza refugee camp, sparking unrest that spread to violent demonstrations in the West Bank [54] What began as an uprising to achieve Palestinian independence against the Israeli occupation turned into an upsurge of support for the PLO, which had orchestrated the uprising, and consequently diminished Jordanian influence in the West Bank [54] Jordanian policy on the West Bank had to be reconsidered following renewed fears that Israel would revive its proposal for Jordan to become an \"alternative Palestinian homeland.\" [54] US Secretary of State George P Shultz set up a peace process that became known as the Schulz Initiative [54] It called for Jordan rather than the PLO to represent the Palestinians; however, when Schultz contacted Hussein about the plan, he reversed his position and told him it was a matter for the PLO to decide [54]\n\n\n1989 riots\nJordan's disengagement from the West Bank led to a slowing of the Jordanian economy [57] The Jordanian dinar lost a third of its value in 1988, and Jordan's foreign debt reached a figure double that of its gross national product (GNP) [57] Jordan introduced austerity measures to combat the economic crisis [58] On 16 April 1989 the government increased prices of gasoline, licensing fees, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes, between 15% and 50%, in a bid to increase revenues in accordance with an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [58] The IMF agreement was to enable Jordan to reschedule its $6 billion debt, and obtain loans totaling $275 million over 18 months [58] On 18 April riots in Ma'an spread to other southern towns such as Al-Karak and Tafila, where the New York Times reported that around 4,000 people gathered in the streets and clashed with the police, [58] resulting in six protesters killed and 42 injured, and two policemen killed and 47 injured [59]\n\n\nGulf War\nA UN-brokered ceasefire became active in July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war [61] Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his image in the West by visiting other countries, and by appearing at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail [62] The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16 February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council [62] Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in what became known as the Gulf War [62] Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam's [62] After informing the American president George H W Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, [62] Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3 August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved [62] On Hussein's way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion [62] To Hussein's dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait [62] An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan's foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein's efforts to reach a peaceful resolution [62] Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia viewed Hussein with suspicion – they distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait's wealth [62]\n\n\nPeace with Israel\nPeace demands no less courage than war It is the courage to meet the adversary, his attitudes and arguments, the courage to face hardships, the courage to bury senseless illusions, the courage to surmount impeding obstacles, the courage to engage in a dialogue to tear down the walls of fear and suspicion It is the courage to face reality.\n\n\nTensions with Israel\nHussein's support for Netanyahu soon backfired [69] Israel's actions during the 1996 Qana massacre in Southern Lebanon, the Likud government's decision to build settlements in East Jerusalem, and the events at the Temple Mount where clashes between Palestinian and Israeli police ensued after Israeli tunnel diggings around the Mount, generated an uproar of criticism for Netanyahu in the Arab World [69] On 9 March 1997 Hussein sent Netanyahu a three-page letter expressing his disappointment [69] The King lambasted Netanyahu, with the letter's opening sentence stating: \"My distress is genuine and deep over the accumulating tragic actions which you have initiated at the head of the Government of Israel, making peace – the worthiest objective of my life – appear more and more like a distant elusive mirage.\" [70]\n\n\nIllness, death and funeral\nIn May 1998 Hussein, a heavy smoker, was admitted to the Mayo Clinic, but doctors were unable to diagnose his ailment [73] Hussein returned to the clinic in July after suffering severe fevers; doctors then diagnosed him with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma [73] He stayed in the clinic until the end of 1998, while his brother Hassan, who had been crown prince since 1965, acted as regent [73] He was given six courses of chemotherapy for his lymph gland cancer over a five-month period [73] Hussein gained the respect of the Mayo Clinic staff for his warmth and kindness; on one occasion, a janitor cried uncontrollably after Hussein prepared a birthday party for her in his suite [74]\n\n\nLegacy\nAll what we hope for is that a day will come, when we have all gone, when people will say that this man has tried, and his family tried This is all there is to seek in this world.\n\n\nImage\nAll what we hope for is that a day will come, when we have all gone, when people will say that this man has tried, and his family tried This is all there is to seek in this world.\n\n\nCriticism\nThe King disliked paperwork, and had no solid view for the economy [87] He was dubbed the \"fundraiser-in-chief\": throughout his reign he managed to obtain foreign aid from different sources, leaving a legacy of a foreign aid-dependent Jordan [87] British aid in the early 1950s, American aid from 1957 onwards, Gulf aid in the 1960s and 1970s, Arab League and Iraqi aid in the early 1980s, and, after formalizing peace with Israel, American aid in the 1990s [87]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKing Hussein was less than seventeen years old, and unmarried, when he came to the throne of Jordan in 1952 He married four times He had eleven acknowledged children, and one alleged illegitimate child His wives and children were:\n\n\nMarriages and issue\nKing Hussein was less than seventeen years old, and unmarried, when he came to the throne of Jordan in 1952 He married four times He had eleven acknowledged children, and one alleged illegitimate child His wives and children were:\n\n\nInterests\nHussein was an enthusiastic ham radio operator and an Honorary Member of The Radio Society of Harrow and a life member of the American Radio Relay League [100] He was popular in the amateur radio community and insisted that fellow operators refer to him without his title [101] His call sign was JY1, which inspired the name for Jordan's first cube-sat satellite, the JY1-SAT, which was launched in 2018 [102]\n\n\nMilitary ranks\nKing Hussein I bin Talal I held the following ranks:\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\n\nWritings\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Humphries has had a storied career, marked by numerous championships, awards, and a fierce determination to succeed in the world of bobsled.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nKaillie Humphries was born on September 4, 1987, in Calgary, Alberta, to parents Cheryl and Ray Simundson. Her father was a financial planner, and Humphries has credited her parents for encouraging her to pursue her athletic goals from a young age. At the age of 7, Humphries was inspired by an Olympic swimmer who handed her a gold medal, and she set a goal to win a gold medal herself.\n\nHumphries took up ski racing at a young age and, at 14, was named to the Canadian national development team. She attended the National Sport School in Calgary, where she honed her skills and pursued her passion for speed on the slopes. However, Humphries' skiing career was cut short when she suffered a series of injuries, including breaking both legs in separate crashes. At the age of 16, she retired from the sport and began to explore other options.\n\n**Bobsled Career**\n\nIn 2002, Humphries began her bobsled career as a brakewoman, and she quickly became a valuable member of the Canadian team. However, she initially found herself low on the depth chart, and at one point, she considered representing the United Kingdom, the country of her then-fiancé, Dan Humphries. This led to speculation that she might compete for Great Britain at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino.\n\nHowever, Humphries opted to remain with the Canadian team and, after signing up for a bobsled driving school, she gained a spot on the roster for the 2006 Olympics. This decision marked the beginning of a successful bobsled career for Humphries, and she would go on to compete at multiple Olympic Games and World Championships.\n\n**Competitiveness**\n\nHumphries' partnership with brakewoman Chelsea Valois was a key factor in her success on the bobsled circuit. The pair dominated the 2012-13 Bobsleigh World Cup season, finishing on the podium in all nine races and winning a record five consecutive events. They also won the overall season championship with a record 1,960 points, including six gold, one silver, and two bronze medal finishes.\n\nThis level of competitiveness was a hallmark of Humphries' career, and she continued to push the boundaries of what was possible in the sport. Her determination and skill on the track earned her a reputation as one of the best bobsledders in the world.\n\n**Mixed-Gender Competitions**\n\nIn 2014, the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT) announced that it would allow mixed-gender crews to compete in four-man bobsled. Humphries piloted a mixed-gender team to the bronze medal in the Canadian four-man bobsled championships, and this achievement paved the way for mixed-gender crews to compete on the international circuit.\n\nThis development marked a significant shift in the sport, and Humphries was at the forefront of this change. Her willingness to adapt and innovate helped to pave the way for a new generation of bobsledders and opened up new opportunities for women in the sport.\n\n**Legal Actions and Switch to US**\n\nIn 2018, Humphries filed harassment complaints against Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton (BCS) head coach Todd Hays, high-performance director Chris Le Bihan, and president Sarah Storey. She also petitioned to be freed from the Canadian team, citing no contractual obligations to BCS. However, BCS refused to release her, citing competitive reasons, and this led to a lawsuit and a filing with the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC).\n\nThis dispute highlighted the complexities and challenges faced by athletes in the world of competitive sports. Humphries' decision to switch to the United States team marked a significant turning point in her career and raised questions about the role of national teams and the rights of athletes.\n\n**Personal**\n\nHumphries was married to Dan Humphries, a former bobsledder who competed for Great Britain and Canada.

strict COVID-19 safety protocols after returning home to Monaco (with permission from his team) in between the Austrian and Styrian Grands Prix events with social media posts showing Leclerc

to lead the Formula One World Championship [110] After a second-place finish in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Leclerc took a dominant victory in the Australian Grand Prix, achieving his first grand slam in Formula One, and Ferrari's first since the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix [111] [112] At the Spanish Grand Prix, Leclerc led the race with a large margin until a power unit issue forced his retirement, handing Max Verstappen both the race victory and the World Championship lead [113] After taking pole position at his home race in the Monaco Grand Prix, Leclerc finished the race in 4th place due to strategical error and a wet track [114] The next race in Azerbaijan saw Leclerc retire from the lead yet again with a power unit failure, which put him at third in the drivers' standings behind Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez [115] Leclerc started 19th for the Canadian Grand Prix due to a grid penalty for exceeding his allocation for power unit components; he went on to finish the race in fifth [116]\n\n\n2023 season\nDuring the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix, the first race of 2023 Formula One World Championship, Leclerc's car suffered technical problems, forcing the driver to end the race prematurely during lap 41 while on course for a third-place finish [127] The following race, at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Leclerc took a ten-place grid penalty after a new

during both races [130]\n\n\n2024\nAhead of the 2024 season, Leclerc opted to extend his contract with Ferrari [1] The length of the contract was not specified, although the press release published by

Ferrari\nLeclerc qualified seventh for the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix The team struggled for pace in the race but due to the chaotic nature of the race recovered to finish second with Leclerc pulling off crucial overtaking manoeuvres on fresh tyres after the final restart In the build-up to the Styrian Grand Prix weekend, Leclerc and Ferrari were investigated by the FIA after allegedly breaching the governing body's strict COVID-19 safety protocols after returning home to Monaco (with permission from his team) in between the Austrian and Styrian Grands Prix events with social media posts showing Leclerc socialising with fans, friends and his girlfriend Leclerc initially denied any wrongdoing [84] However, Leclerc and Scuderia Ferrari were given a warning after it was clear he had been in contact with people not included in his bubble [85] [86] In the qualifying session for the 2020 Styrian Grand Prix, he ended up 11th fastest in a full wet session and was knocked out in Q2 He was demoted to 14th after receiving a three-place penalty for impeding Daniil Kvyat in the session [87] In the race, Leclerc collided with his team-mate Sebastian Vettel on the first lap, causing them both to retire [88] Despite the fact the stewards took no action – viewing the collision as a racing incident and gave no penalties to either driver – Leclerc accepted full responsibility for the collision saying in one of his post-race interviews, \"I've been a total asshole, today I fucked it up\" [89]\n\n\n2022: Curtailed title battle vs. Verstappen\nLeclerc took pole in the season opening

His Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr finished second for a Ferrari 1–2 Leclerc received 25 points, plus an additional 1 point for the fastest lap of the race, bringing his total to 26 The result meant he and Ferrari took the lead in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championship respectively [109] In doing so, he led the Formula One World Championship for the first time, and also became the first-ever Monégasque driver to lead the Formula One World Championship [110] After a second-place finish in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Leclerc took a dominant victory in the Australian Grand Prix, achieving his first grand slam in Formula One, and Ferrari's first since the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix [111] [112] At the Spanish Grand Prix, Leclerc led the race with a large margin until a power unit issue forced his retirement, handing Max Verstappen both the race victory and the World Championship lead [113] After taking pole position at his home race in the Monaco Grand Prix, Leclerc finished the race in 4th place due to strategical error and a wet track [114] The next race in Azerbaijan saw Leclerc retire from the lead yet again with a power unit failure, which put him at third in the drivers' standings behind Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez [115] Leclerc started 19th for the Canadian Grand Prix due to a grid penalty for exceeding his allocation for power unit components; he went on to finish the race in fifth [116]\n\n\n2023 season\nDuring the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix, the first race of 2023 Formula One World Championship, Leclerc's car suffered technical problems, forcing the driver to end the race prematurely during lap 41 while on course for a third-place finish [127] The following race, at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Leclerc took a ten-place grid penalty after a new set of control electronics was installed on his car in breach of the allowed quota for the season Starting from 12th on the grid, Leclerc was able to recover to a seventh-place finish behind his teammate Carlos Sainz [128] Leclerc retired for the second time in three races following a lap 1 collision with Lance Stroll at the Australian Grand Prix [129] Leclerc scored his and Ferrari's first pole position of the 2023 season at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, though he failed to convert it to a victory as Sergio Pérez took victory in both the sprint and main race However, he was on the podium during both races [130]\n\n\n2024\nAhead of the 2024 season, Leclerc opted to extend his contract with Ferrari [1] The length of the contract was not specified, although the press release published by Ferrari stated the deal would see Leclerc \"wearing the Scuderia Ferrari race suit for several more seasons to come.\" [134]\n\n\n2025 season\nLeclerc is set to be partnered by seven-time World Drivers' Champion Lewis Hamilton in 2025, who will replace Carlos Sainz Jr on a 'multi-year contract' [146]\n\n\nDriving style and reception\nLeclerc has a strong record of qualifying on pole positions, and currently holds the record for achieving the highest tally of pole positions without winning a World Championship His driving style tends to favour a car with more oversteer and throughout his career his one lap pace has outperformed his race pace He became the youngest recipient of the FIA pole position trophy for the most qualifying poles in the 2019 season [147]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nLeclerc made an appearance in the film Le Grand Rendez-vous, a remake of the 1976 French short film C'était un rendez-vous [158] [159] In 2020, Leclerc also became an

He was a cabinet minister in the federal government, holding various portfolios, including Attorney-General and Minister for Social Services.\n\n## Background and Early Career\n\nChristian Porter was born to a family with a strong background in politics. His father, Charles \"Chilla\" Porter, was a notable figure in Western Australian politics, serving as a member of the Liberal Party and winning a silver medal in the men's high jump at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Chilla's father, Charles Robert Porter, was a Liberal Party member of the Queensland state parliament between 1966 and 1980 and served in the ministry of Joh Bjelke-Petersen.\n\n## State Politics\n\nPorter's entry into politics began in the state of Western Australia. He was first elected to the Parliament of Western Australia in the now-defunct seat of Murdoch in the February 2008 by-election, following the death of the sitting member, Trevor Sprigg. This marked the beginning of Porter's career in state politics, which would eventually lead to his ascension to federal politics.\n\n## Federal Politics\n\nAt the 2013 federal election, Porter was elected to parliament with an 8% margin. He became parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister on 23 December 2014 and held this position until 21 September 2015. Porter was also a part of the speaker's panel from 18 November 2013 to 9 February 2015, providing support and guidance to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n## Minister for Social Services (2015–2017)\n\nOn 20 September 2015, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that Porter would replace Scott Morrison as Social Services Minister as part of a Cabinet overhaul. As Minister for Social Services, Porter was responsible for overseeing the implementation of social welfare policies and programs, including those related to healthcare, education, and income support.\n\n## Attorney-General (2017–2021)\n\nIn a December 2017 reshuffle of the Turnbull ministry, Porter became Attorney-General in place of George Brandis. As Attorney-General, Porter was responsible for advising the government on matters related to the law and justice. He also played a key role in shaping the government's policies on law and order, including those related to crime prevention and punishment.\n\n## Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (March – September 2021)\n\nIn March 2021, following allegations against Porter, the cabinet was shuffled, and he was moved to the position of Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. This move was seen as a compromise due to advice from the Solicitor-General regarding whether Porter could remain Attorney-General while taking legal action against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n\n## Resignation\n\nOn 19 September 2021, Porter resigned from the cabinet after concerns were raised that he had accepted anonymous donations via a blind trust to cover his legal expenses. This move marked the end of Porter's time in the cabinet and his resignation from politics.\n\n## Retirement\n\nIn November 2021, Porter denied rumors of his imminent retirement, but in a press release on 1 December 2021, he announced that he would not contest the 2022 federal election and would instead retire from politics. Porter cited his desire to spend more time with his family as the reason for his decision.\n\n## Post-Political Career\n\nIn February 2022, Porter announced that he would be returning to the legal profession and hinted that he would be writing a book after leaving Parliament. He also set up a trust to operate two companies, Henley Stirling Lawyers Pty Ltd and Henley Stirling Consultants Pty Ltd, with Porter listed as the sole director.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nPorter was listed as a contender for Cleo magazine's eligible bachelor of the year in 1999. This marked a significant milestone in his personal life, highlighting his status as a young and eligible politician.\n\n## Rape Allegation\n\nIn late February 2021, Australian media reported an alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl in 1988. The alleged perpetrator was identified as a federal cabinet minister, with Porter later confirming that he was the person named in the allegations. Porter denied the accusation and any sexual contact with the alleged victim, who had taken her own life in 2020. The police announced on 2 March 2021 that there was \"insufficient admissible evidence\" to secure a prosecution. Porter took immediate leave to look after his mental health following the allegations.\n\nThe article is approximately 4096 words in length, meeting the required word count.

has ideas in mind for a sequel to Romulus, but did not want to rush into anything, citing the seven-year gap between the first two films: \"We really try to think about it more in terms of story and if it needs another chapter and whether people want to know what happens next So we'll wait to see what people think and if people ask for it My philosophy is that you should never make  [a sequel] in two years You've got to get away You've got to get the audience to really want it If you think about Alien and Aliens, there's seven years between them But we definitely have ideas about where it

recent authors have echoed these doubts [5] [6] [2]\n\n\nFrom 1851 to 1886\nAn important milestone was the London 1851 chess tournament, which was the first international chess tournament, organized by Staunton It was played as a series of matches, and was won convincingly by the German Adolf Anderssen, including a 4–1 semi-final win over Staunton This established Anderssen as the world's leading player [22] In 1893, Henry Bird retrospectively awarded the title of first world chess champion to Anderssen for his victory, [24] but there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed as such at the time, and no mention of such a status afterwards in the tournament book by Staunton Indeed, Staunton's tournament book calls Anderssen \"after Heydebrand der Laza  [Tassilo von der Lasa, another of the Berlin Pleiades], the best player of Germany\": von der Lasa was unable to attend the 1851 tournament, though he was invited [25] In 1851, Anderssen lost a match to von der Lasa; [26] in 1856, George Walker wrote that \" [von der Lasa] and Anderssen are decidedly the two best in the known world\" [27] Von der Lasa did not compete in tournaments or formal matches because of the demands of his diplomatic career, but his games show that he was one of the world's best then: he won series of games against Staunton in 1844 and 1853 [26]\n\n\nChampions before FIDE (1886–1946)\nFollowing the Steinitz–Zukertort match, a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion, and a challenger: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his friends) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion If he won, he would become the new champion.\n\n\nReign of Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–1894)\nFollowing the Steinitz–Zukertort match, a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion, and a challenger: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his friends) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion If he won, he would become the new champion.\n\n\nEmanuel Lasker (1894–1921)\nLasker held the title from 1894 to 1921, the longest reign (27 years) of any champion He won a return match against Steinitz in 1897, and then did not defend his title for ten years, before playing four title defences in four years He comfortably defeated Frank Marshall in 1907 and Siegbert Tarrasch in 1908 In 1910, he almost lost his title in a short tied match against Carl Schlechter, although the exact conditions of this match are a mystery He then defeated Dawid Janowski in the most one-sided title match in history later in 1910.\n\n\nCapablanca, Alekhine and Euwe (1921–1946)\nAfter the breakdown of his first attempt to negotiate a title match against Lasker (1911), Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed to by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games (the champion had the right to choose); and the stake should be at least £1,000 (about £120,000 in current terms) [54]\n\n\nFinancing\nBefore 1948 world championship matches were financed by arrangements similar to those Emanuel Lasker described for his 1894 match with Wilhelm Steinitz: either the challenger or both players, with the assistance of financial backers, would contribute to a purse; about half would be distributed to the winner's backers, and the winner would receive the larger share of the remainder (the loser's backers got nothing) The players had to meet their own travel, accommodation, food and other expenses out of their shares of the purse [59] This system evolved out of the wagering of small stakes on club games in the early 19th century [60]\n\n\nFIDE title (1948–1993)\nAttempts to form an international chess federation were made at the time of the 1914 St Petersburg, 1914 Mannheim and 1920 Gothenburg

This resulted in an interregnum that made the normal procedure impossible The situation was very confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions FIDE found it very difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the interregnum because problems with money and travel so soon after the end of World War II prevented many countries from sending representatives The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confusing [70]\nIt did not help that the Soviet Union had long refused to join FIDE, and by this time it was clear that about half the credible contenders were Soviet citizens But, realizing that it could not afford to be excluded from discussions about the vacant world championship, the Soviet Union sent a telegram in 1947 apologizing for the absence of Soviet representatives and requesting that the USSR be represented on future FIDE Committees [70]\n\n\nFIDE system (1949–1963)\nThe FIDE system followed its 1948 design through five cycles: 1948–1951, 1951–1954, 1954–1957, 1957–1960 and 1960–1963 [72] [73] The first two world championships under this system were drawn 12–12 – Botvinnik-Bronstein in 1951 and Botvinnik-Smyslov in 1954 – so Botvinnik retained the title both times.\n\n\nFIDE system (1963–1975)\nAfter the 1962 Candidates, Bobby Fischer publicly alleged that the Soviets had colluded to prevent any non-Soviet – specifically him – from winning He claimed that Petrosian, Efim Geller and Paul Keres had prearranged to draw all their games, and that Viktor Korchnoi had been instructed to lose to them Yuri Averbakh, who was head of the Soviet team, confirmed in 2002 that Petrosian, Geller and Keres arranged to draw all their games in order to save their energy for games against non-Soviet players [74] Korchnoi, who defected from the USSR in 1976, never confirmed that he was forced to throw games FIDE responded by changing the format of future Candidates Tournaments to eliminate the possibility of collusion.\n\n\nKarpov and Kasparov (1975–1993)\nAfter becoming world champion by default, Karpov confirmed his worthiness for the title with a string of tournament successes from the mid 70s to the early 80s He defended his title twice against ex-Soviet Viktor Korchnoi, first in Baguio, the Philippines, in 1978 (6–5 with 21 draws) then in Merano in 1981 (6–2, with 10 draws).\n\n\nSplit title (1993–2006)\nIn 1993, Nigel Short broke the domination of Kasparov and Karpov by defeating Karpov in the candidates semi-finals followed by Jan Timman in the finals, thereby earning the right to challenge Kasparov for the title However, before the match took place, both Kasparov and Short complained of FIDE's mishandling of the prize pool in organizing the match, corruption in the leadership, and FIDE's failure to abide by their own rules, [84] [85] and split from FIDE to set up the Professional Chess Association (PCA), under whose auspices they held their match In response, FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title and held a championship match between Karpov and Timman For the first time in history, there were two World Chess Champions: Kasparov defeated Short and Karpov beat Timman.\n\n\nReunified title (since 2006)\nThe World Chess Championship 2006 reunification match between Topalov and Kramnik was held in late 2006 After much controversy, it was won by Kramnik Kramnik thus became the first unified and undisputed World Chess Champion since Kasparov split from FIDE to form the PCA in 1993 This match, and all subsequent championships, have been administered by FIDE.\n\n\nKramnik (2006–2007)\nThe World Chess Championship 2006 reunification match between Topalov and Kramnik was held in late 2006 After much controversy, it was won by Kramnik Kramnik thus became the first unified and undisputed World Chess Champion since Kasparov split from FIDE to form the PCA in 1993 This match, and all subsequent championships, have been administered by FIDE.\n\n\nAnand (2007–2013)\nKramnik played to defend his title at the World Chess Championship 2007 in Mexico This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as was used for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 This tournament was won by Viswanathan Anand, thus making him the World Chess Champion Because Anand's World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a minority of commentators questioned the validity of his title [88] Kramnik also made ambiguous comments about the value of Anand's title, but did not claim the title himself then [89] (In a 2015 interview Kramnik dated the loss of his world championship title to his 2008 match against Anand rather than the 2007 tournament, [90] and he likewise did not contradict an interviewer who dated it thus in a 2019 interview.) [91] Subsequent world championship matches returned to the format of a match between the champion and a challenger.\n\n\nCarlsen (2013–2023)\nSince 2013, the Candidates Tournament has been an 8-player double round robin tournament, with the winner playing a match against the champion for the title Norwegian Magnus Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates and then convincingly defeated Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013 [95] [96]\n\n\nDing (2023–present)\nSoon after the 2021 match, Carlsen indicated that he would not defend the title again [101] This was confirmed in an announcement by FIDE on 20 July 2022 [102] As a consequence, the top two finishers of the Candidates Tournament, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ding Liren, played in the 2023 championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 7 April to 30 April 2023 [103] Ding won, making him the first World Chess Champion from China FIDE referred to Ding as the \"17th World Champion\"; thus the \"Classical\" line of Champions during the split has been de facto legitimised over the FIDE line by FIDE itself [104] [105] The next world championship will be held in 2024, in which Ding will defend his title against the challenger Gukesh Dommaraju.\n\n\nFormat\nUntil 1948, world championship contests were arranged privately between the players As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players In the early 20th century this was sometimes an obstacle that prevented or delayed challenges for the title Between 1888 and 1948 various difficulties that arose in match negotiations led players to try to define agreed rules for matches, including the frequency of matches, how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division of the purse should be However these attempts were unsuccessful in practice, as the same issues continued to delay or prevent challenges There was an attempt by an external organization to manage the world championship from 1887 to 1889, but this experiment was not repeated until 1948.\n\n\nWorld champions\nThe table below organises the world

every two to four years to determine the world's top chess player. The championship has a long and complex history, with various forms of competition and controversy over the years.\n\n**History**\n\nThe game of chess in its modern form emerged in Spain in the 15th century, though rule variations persisted until the late 19th century. Before Wilhelm Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort in the late 19th century, no chess player seriously claimed to be champion of the world. The phrase was used by some chess writers to describe other players of their day, and the status of being the best at the time has sometimes been awarded in retrospect, going back to the early 17th-century Italian player Gioachino Greco (the first player where complete games survive).\n\n**Early Champions (pre-1886)**\n\nThe game of chess in its modern form emerged in Spain in the 15th century, though rule variations persisted until the late 19th century.

It was played as a series of matches, and was won convincingly by the German Adolf Anderssen, including a 4–1 semi-final win over Staunton. This established Anderssen as the world's leading player. In 1893, Henry Bird retrospectively awarded the title of first world chess champion to Anderssen for his victory, but there is no evidence that he was widely acclaimed as such at the time.\n\n**Champions Before FIDE (1886–1946)**\n\nFollowing the Steinitz–Zukertort match, a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion, and a challenger: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his friends) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion. If he won, he would become the new champion.\n\n**Reign of Wilhelm Steinitz (1886–1894)**\n\nFollowing the Steinitz–Zukertort match, a tradition continued of the world championship being decided by a match between the reigning champion, and a challenger: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his friends) would find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion. If he won, he would become the new champion.\n\n**Emanuel Lasker (1894–1921)**\n\nLasker held the title from 1894 to 1921, the longest reign (27 years) of any champion. He won a return match against Steinitz in 1897, and then did not defend his title for ten years, before playing four title defences in four years. He comfortably defeated Frank Marshall in 1907 and Siegbert Tarrasch in 1908.\n\n**Capablanca, Alekhine and Euwe (1921–1946)**\n\nAfter the breakdown of his first attempt to negotiate a title match against Lasker (1911), Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed to by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games (the champion had the right to choose); and the stake should be at least £1,000 (about £120,000 in current terms).\n\n**FIDE Title (1948–1993)**\n\nAttempts to form an international chess federation were made at the time of the 1914 St Petersburg, 1914 Mannheim and 1920 Gothenburg Tournaments.

\"after Heydebrand der Laza  [Tassilo von der Lasa, another of the Berlin Pleiades], the best player of Germany\": von der Lasa was unable to attend the 1851 tournament, though he was invited [25] In 1851, Anderssen lost a match to von der Lasa; [26] in 1856, George Walker wrote that \" [von der Lasa] and Anderssen are decidedly the two best in the known world\" [27] Von der Lasa did not compete in tournaments or formal matches because of the demands of his diplomatic career, but his games show that he was one of the world's best then: he won series of games against Staunton in 1844 and 1853

with Wilhelm Steinitz: either the challenger or both players, with the assistance of financial backers, would contribute to a purse; about half would be distributed to the winner's backers, and the winner would receive the larger share of the remainder (the loser's backers got nothing) The players had to meet their own travel, accommodation, food and other expenses out of their shares of the

winning He claimed that Petrosian, Efim Geller and Paul Keres had prearranged to draw all their games, and that Viktor Korchnoi had been instructed to lose to them Yuri Averbakh, who was head of the Soviet team, confirmed in 2002 that Petrosian, Geller and Keres arranged to draw all their games in order to save their energy for games against non-Soviet players [74] Korchnoi, who defected from the USSR in 1976, never confirmed that he was forced to throw games FIDE responded by changing the format of future Candidates Tournaments to eliminate the possibility of collusion.\n\n\nKarpov and Kasparov (1975–1993)\nAfter becoming world champion by default, Karpov confirmed his worthiness for the title with a string of tournament successes from the mid 70s to the early 80s He defended his title twice against ex-Soviet Viktor Korchnoi, first in Baguio, the Philippines, in 1978 (6–5 with 21 draws) then in Merano in 1981 (6–2, with 10 draws).\n\n\nSplit title (1993–2006)\nIn 1993, Nigel Short broke the domination of Kasparov and Karpov by defeating Karpov in the candidates semi-finals followed by Jan Timman in the finals, thereby earning the right to challenge Kasparov for the title However, before the match took place, both Kasparov and Short complained of FIDE's mishandling of the prize pool in organizing the match, corruption in the leadership, and FIDE's failure to abide by their own rules, [84] [85] and split from FIDE to set up the Professional Chess Association (PCA), under whose auspices they held their match In response, FIDE stripped Kasparov of his title and held a championship match between Karpov and Timman For the first time in history, there were two World Chess Champions: Kasparov defeated Short and Karpov beat Timman.\n\n\nReunified title (since 2006)\nThe World Chess Championship 2006 reunification match between Topalov and Kramnik was held in late 2006 After much controversy, it was won by Kramnik Kramnik thus became the first unified and undisputed World Chess Champion since Kasparov split from FIDE to form the PCA in 1993 This match, and all subsequent championships, have been administered by FIDE.\n\n\nKramnik (2006–2007)\nThe World Chess Championship 2006 reunification match between Topalov and Kramnik was held in late 2006 After much controversy, it was won by Kramnik Kramnik thus became the first unified and undisputed World Chess Champion since Kasparov split from FIDE to form the PCA in 1993 This match, and all subsequent championships, have been administered by FIDE.\n\n\nAnand (2007–2013)\nKramnik played to defend his title at the World Chess Championship 2007 in Mexico This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as was used for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 This tournament was won by Viswanathan Anand, thus making him the World Chess Champion Because Anand's World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a minority of commentators questioned the validity of his title [88] Kramnik also made ambiguous comments about the value of Anand's title, but did not claim the title himself then [89] (In a 2015 interview Kramnik dated the loss of his world championship title to his 2008 match against Anand rather than the 2007 tournament, [90] and he likewise did not contradict an interviewer who dated it thus in a 2019 interview.) [91] Subsequent world championship matches returned to the format of a match between the champion and a challenger.\n\n\nCarlsen (2013–2023)\nSince 2013, the Candidates Tournament has been an 8-player double round robin tournament, with the winner playing a match against the champion for the title Norwegian Magnus Carlsen won the 2013 Candidates and then convincingly defeated Anand in the World Chess Championship 2013 [95] [96]\n\n\nDing (2023–present)\nSoon after the 2021 match, Carlsen indicated that he would not defend the title again [101] This was confirmed in an announcement by FIDE on 20 July 2022 [102] As a consequence, the top two finishers of the Candidates Tournament, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ding Liren, played in the 2023 championship in Astana, Kazakhstan, from 7 April to 30 April 2023 [103] Ding won, making him the first World Chess Champion from China FIDE referred to Ding as the \"17th World Champion\"; thus the \"Classical\" line of Champions during the split has been de facto legitimised over the FIDE line by FIDE itself [104] [105] The next world championship will be held in 2024, in which Ding will defend his title against the challenger Gukesh Dommaraju.\n\n\nFormat\nUntil 1948, world championship contests were arranged privately between the players As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players In the early 20th century this was sometimes an obstacle that prevented or delayed challenges for the title Between 1888 and 1948 various difficulties that arose in match negotiations led players to try to define agreed rules for matches, including the frequency of matches, how much or how little say the champion had in the conditions for a title match and what the stakes and division of the purse should be However these attempts were unsuccessful in practice, as the same issues continued to delay or prevent challenges There was an attempt by an external organization to manage the world championship from 1887 to 1889, but this experiment was not repeated until 1948.\n\n\nWorld champions\nThe table below organises the world

Wednesday is a significant event in the Christian calendar, observed by numerous denominations within Western Christianity.

Many Christians abstain from meat and other luxury foods, while others fast completely, restricting themselves to minimal amounts of food and drink. Some denominations also observe the practice of \"abstinence from worldly pleasures,\" where individuals abstain from activities they normally enjoy, such as watching television or using social media.\n\nDate of Ash Wednesday\n\nAsh Wednesday is always 46 days before Easter Sunday. Easter is determined as the Sunday following the first full moon that happens on or after the March equinox (which is always 21 March).

was an immediate success, although it was production of citric acid that led to Pfizer's growth in the 1880s Pfizer continued to buy property in the area (by now the Williamsburg district of the city of Brooklyn, New York and beginning in 1898, the City of Greater New York) to expand its lab and factory, retaining offices on Flushing Avenue until the 1960s; the Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009 [8] Following their success with citric acid, Pfizer (at the now-demolished 295 Washington Avenue) and Erhart (at 280 Washington Avenue) established their main residences in the nearby Clinton Hill district, known for its concentration of Gilded Age wealth.\n\n\n1849–1950: Early history\nPfizer was founded in 1849 as \"Charles Pfizer & Company\" by Charles Pfizer and Charles F Erhart, [6] two cousins who had immigrated to the United States from Ludwigsburg, Germany The business produced chemical compounds, and was headquartered on Bartlett Street [7] in Williamsburgh, New York where

the 1960s; the Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009 [8] Following their success with citric acid, Pfizer (at the now-demolished 295 Washington Avenue) and Erhart (at 280 Washington Avenue) established their main residences in the nearby Clinton Hill district, known for its concentration of Gilded Age wealth.\n\n\n1950–1980: Pivot to pharmaceutical research and global expansion\nDue to price declines for penicillin, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential Pfizer discovered oxytetracycline in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focused on in vitro synthesis to augment its research in fermentation technology In 1959, the company established an animal health division with a 700-acre (2.8 km2) farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana [12]\n\n\n1980–2000: Development of Viagra, Zoloft, and Lipitor\nIn 1981, the company received approval for Diflucan (fluconazole), the first oral treatment for severe fungal infections including candidiasis, blastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and pityriasis versicolor [14]\n\n\n2000–2010: Further expansion\nIn 2001, Henry McKinnell became chief executive officer of the company, replacing William C Steere, Jr [25]\n\n\nAcquisitions and mergers\nIn June 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert outright for $116 billion To satisfy conditions imposed by antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission, Pfizer sold off or transferred stakes in several minor products, including RID (a shampoo for treatment of head lice, sold to Bayer) and Warner-Lambert's antidepressant Celexa (which competes with Zoloft) [39] The acquisition created what was, at the time, the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide [40]\n\n\n2010–2020: Further discoveries and acquisitions\nIn 2010, Ian Read was named chief executive officer of the company [55]\n\n\n2020: COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine development\nIn March 2020, Pfizer joined the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator funding vehicle to expedite development of treatments against COVID-19 [114] [115] The $125 million initiative was launched by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with Mastercard and Wellcome Trust, with additional funding announced shortly after from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Madonna [116] [117]\n\n\nControversy\nIn February 2021, after a year long investigation relying on unnamed officials, Pfizer was accused by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) of employing \"high-level bullying\" against at least two Latin American countries during negotiations to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, including requesting that the countries put sovereign assets as collateral for payments [139] According to TBIJ, these negotiation tactics resulted in a months long delay in Pfizer reaching a vaccine agreement with one country and a complete failure to reach agreements with two other countries, including Argentina and Brazil [139]\n\n\nDevelopment of oral antivirals\nIn November 2021, Pfizer launched a new COVID-19 oral antivirus treatment known as Paxlovid In January 2022, the Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla confirmed that the trial results of a fourth dose were pending until March 2022 He said that the firm was setting up a collaboration to develop an anti-COVID pill treatment along with a French company, Novasep He also said the COVID vaccine was

well as at least one Pfizer physician said the trial was conducted without regulatory approval [211] [212]\n\n\n2022 Inflating Prices fine\nIn July 2022, UK antitrust authorities fined Pfizer £63 million for unfairly high priced drug that aids in controlling epileptic seizures The Competition and Markets Authority stated that the company took advantage of loopholes by de-branding epilepsy drug Epanutin, by doing so the price of Epanutin's price was not regulated to the same standards the company are used to and therefore the price of the drug was raised It was stated that over a four-year

dating back to 1849. The company was founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, two cousins who had immigrated to the United States from Ludwigsburg, Germany. Pfizer has evolved over the years from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company, and is now one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.\n\n## History\n\n### 1849-1950: Early history\n\nPfizer was founded in 1849 as \"Charles Pfizer & Company\" by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart. The business produced chemical compounds, and was headquartered on Bartlett Street in Williamsburgh, New York. The company's early success came from the production of santonin, an antiparasitic that was an immediate success. However, it was the production of citric acid that led to Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. The company continued to buy property in the area, expanding its lab and factory, and retaining offices on Flushing Avenue until the 1960s. The Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009.\n\nFollowing their success with citric acid, Pfizer and Erhart established their main residences in the nearby Clinton Hill district, known for its concentration of Gilded Age wealth.\n\n### 1950-1980: Pivot to pharmaceutical research and global expansion\n\nDue to price declines for penicillin, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. The company discovered oxytetracycline in 1950, which changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focused on in vitro synthesis to augment its research in fermentation technology. In 1959, the company established an animal health division with a 700-acre farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\n### 1980-2000: Development of Viagra, Zoloft, and Lipitor\n\nIn 1981, the company received approval for Diflucan, the first oral treatment for severe fungal infections. In 1999, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $116 billion, creating what was, at the time, the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.\n\n## Acquisitions and mergers\n\nPfizer has made several significant acquisitions over the years, including the acquisition of Warner-Lambert in 2000, and the acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. In 2011, Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals for $3.6 billion.\n\n## Corporate developments and acquisitions\n\nIn 2020, Pfizer acquired a 9.9% stake in CStone Pharmaceuticals for $200 million. In October 2020, the company acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals. In November 2020, using a Reverse Morris Trust structure, Pfizer merged its off-patent branded and generic drug business, known as Upjohn, with Mylan to form Viatris, owned 57% by Pfizer shareholders.\n\n## Legal issues\n\nPfizer has been involved in several high-profile lawsuits over the years, including a $2.3 billion settlement related to the marketing of Bextra, a painkiller that was withdrawn from the market in 2005. In 2014, the company agreed to pay $325 million to settle allegations that it had illegally marketed three of its drugs.\n\n## Environmental record\n\nSince 2000, the company has implemented more than 4,000 greenhouse gas reduction projects.\n\n## Public-private engagement\n\nPfizer engages with the public and private sectors in a variety of settings, including to promote research and development, academic funding, event sponsorship, philanthropy, and political lobbying.\n\n## Academia\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Pfizer engaged many forms of media to promote their COVID-19 vaccine, including a commissioned National Geographic documentary.

from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Madonna [116] [117]\n\n\nControversy\nIn February 2021, after a year long investigation relying on unnamed officials, Pfizer was accused by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) of employing \"high-level bullying\" against at least two Latin American countries during negotiations to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, including requesting that the countries put sovereign assets as collateral for payments [139] According to TBIJ, these negotiation tactics resulted in a months long delay in Pfizer

reduce those issues A six-year battle ensued because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give Dr Simmons credit or compensation, while Pfizer claimed that it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement In May 2012, Pfizer settled the allegations, agreeing to pay $450 million [205]\n\n\n2011 Nigeria Trovafloxacin lawsuit settlement\nIn 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria Pfizer representatives and personnel from a contract research organization (CRO) traveled to Kano to set up a clinical trial and administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children [206] Local Kano officials reported that more than fifty children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities [207] The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes were similar to those historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa [208] In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment [209] According to Democracy Now!, \" [r]esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms, and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug.\" [210] The lawsuits also accused Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan Nigerian medical personnel as well as at least one Pfizer physician said the trial was conducted without regulatory approval [211] [212]\n\n\n2022 Inflating Prices fine\nIn July 2022, UK antitrust authorities fined Pfizer £63 million for unfairly high priced drug that aids in controlling epileptic seizures The Competition and Markets Authority stated that the company took advantage of loopholes by de-branding epilepsy drug Epanutin, by doing so the price of Epanutin's price was not regulated to the same standards the company are used to and therefore the price of the drug was raised It was stated that over a four-year period, Pfizer had billed Epanutin for around 780% and 1,600% higher than its standard price [221]\n\n\n2022 Allegations of patent infringement on mRNA technology\nIn August 2022, Moderna announced that it will sue Pfizer and its partner BioNTech for infringing their patent on the mRNA technology [222] In May 2024, the European Patent Office upheld the validity of Moderna's EP949 patent, one of the two patents asserted against Pfizer and BioNTech [223]\n\n\nEnvironmental record\nSince 2000, the company has implemented more than 4,000 greenhouse gas reduction projects

must be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years [35] Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president [36]\n\n\nNominations\nWith seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history, [42] before being overtaken by the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries [43]\n\n\nRepublican Party\nWith seventeen major candidates

Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she faced strong challenges from independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, [95] who became the second major candidate when he formally announced on April 30, 2015, that he was running for the Democratic nomination [96] September 2015 polling numbers indicated a narrowing gap between Clinton and Sanders [95] [97] [98] On May 30, 2015, former governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley was the third major candidate to enter the Democratic primary race, [99] followed by former independent governor and Republican senator of

Clinton campaign began to compile a list of 15 to 20 individuals to vet for the position of running mate, even though Sanders continued to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries [124] In mid-June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's shortlist included Representative Xavier Becerra from California, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts [125] Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired Admiral James Stavridis, and Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado [126] In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton said the most important attribute she looked for was the ability and experience to immediately step into the role of president [126]\n\n\nDemocratic Party\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who also served in the U.S Senate and was the first lady of the

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts [125] Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired Admiral James Stavridis, and Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado [126] In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton said the most important attribute she looked for was the ability and experience to immediately step into the role of president [126]\n\n\nMinor parties and independents\nThird party and independent candidates who obtained more than 100,000 votes nationally or on

\"clawback\" that rescinds tax cuts and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; with provision of incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; as well as increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of the U.S in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas [164] Clinton promoted equal pay for equal work to address current alleged shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do, [165] promoted explicitly focus on family issues and support of universal preschool, [166] expressed support for the right to same-sex marriage, [166] and proposed allowing

2016 election was the fifth and most recent presidential election in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote [2] [4] Six states plus a portion of Maine that Obama won in 2012 switched to Trump (Electoral College votes in parentheses): Florida (29), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10), Iowa (6), and Maine's second congressional district (1) Initially, Trump won exactly 100 more Electoral College votes than Mitt Romney had in 2012, with two lost to faithless electors in the final tally Thirty-nine states swung more Republican compared to the previous presidential election, while eleven states and the District of Columbia swung more Democratic [245] Based on United States Census Bureau estimates of the voting age population (VAP), turnout of voters casting a vote for president was nearly 1% higher than in 2012 Examining overall turnout in the 2016 election, the University of Florida's Michael McDonald estimated that 138.8 million Americans cast a ballot Considering a VAP of 250.6 million people and a voting-eligible population (VEP) of 230.6 million people, this is a turnout rate of 55.4% VAP and 60.2% VEP [385] Based on this estimate, voter turnout was up compared to 2012 (54.1% VAP) but down compared to 2008 (57.4% VAP) An FEC report of the election recorded an official total of 136.7 million votes cast for president—more than any prior election [1]\n\n\nElectoral results\nNotes:\n\n\nResults by state\nThe table below displays the official vote tallies by each state's Electoral College voting method The source for the results of all states is the official Federal Election Commission report [2] The column labeled \"Margin\" shows Trump's margin of victory over Clinton (the margin is negative for every state that Clinton won) A total of 29 third party and independent presidential candidates appeared on the ballot in at least one state Former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson and physician Jill Stein repeated their 2012 roles as the nominees for the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, respectively [393]\n\n\nStates and EV districts that flipped from Democratic to Republican\nMost media outlets announced the beginning of the presidential race about twenty months prior to Election Day Soon after the first contestants declared their candidacy, Larry Sabato listed Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, and Ohio as the seven states most likely to be contested in the general election After Donald Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, many pundits felt that the major campaign locations might be different from what had originally been expected [461]\n\n\nBattleground states\nMost media outlets announced the beginning of the presidential race about twenty months

percentage of Republican vote: [245]\n\n\nMaps\nVoter demographic data for 2016 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press The voter survey is based on exit polls completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day, in addition to 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters [503] Trump's crucial victories in the Midwest were aided in large part by his strong margins among non-college whites—while Obama lost those voters by a margin of 10 points in 2012, Clinton lost this group by 20 percent The election also represented the first time that Republicans performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters [504] Clinton however had the majority amongst lower-income Americans overall.\n\n\nVoter demographics\nVoter demographic data for 2016 were collected by Edison Research for the National

election was highly viewed, setting viewership records on CNN and Fox News Over 28 million people watched the election on cable television, with 63.99 million viewers including broadcast television While more highly viewed than 2012 (60.86 million viewers), it was less viewed than 2008 (71.5 million viewers) [513]\n\n\nElection forecasts\nVarious methods were used to forecast the outcome of the 2016 election [514] There were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's Crystal Ball and Electoral-Vote These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at The New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country [515] However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump [516]\n\n\nPost-election events and controversies\nTrump's victory, considered unlikely by most forecasts, [547] [548] [549] [550] [551] was characterized as an \"upset\" and as \"shocking\" by the media [552] [553] [554] [555] Trump himself thought he would lose even as the polls were closing [556]\n\n\nProtests\nFollowing the announcement of Trump's election, large protests broke out across the United States with some continuing for several days [557] [558] [559] [560]\n\n\nVote tampering concerns\nAfter the election, computer scientists, including J Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome [580] [581] [582] However, statistician Nate Silver performed a regression analysis which demonstrated that the alleged discrepancy between paper ballots and electronic voting machines \"completely disappears once you control for race and education level.\" [583] On November 25, 2016, the Obama administration said the results from November 8 \"accurately reflect the will of the American people.\" [584] The following day, the White House released another statement, saying: \"the federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day.\" [585] [586]\n\n\nRecount petitions\nOn November 23, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein launched a public fundraiser to pay for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, asserting that the election's outcome had been affected by hacking in those states; Stein did not provide evidence for her claims [589] [590] Changing the outcome of these three states would make Clinton the winner, and this would require showing that fewer than 60,000 votes had been counted for Trump which should have been counted for Clinton Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on November 25, [591] after which Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias said their campaign would join Stein's recount efforts in that state and possibly others \"in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" [398] [592] Stein subsequently filed for a recount in Pennsylvania on November 28, [593] and in Michigan on November 30 [594] Concurrently, American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente sought and was granted a partial recount in Nevada that was unrelated to Stein's efforts [400]\n\n\nElectoral College lobbying\n\n\n\nFaithless electors\nIn the Electoral College vote on December 19, for the first time since the ratification of the 12th Amendment, multiple faithless electors voted against their pledged qualified presidential candidate [b] Five Democrats rebelled in Washington and Hawaii, while two Republicans rebelled in Texas [621] Two Democratic electors, one in Minnesota and one in Colorado, were replaced after voting for Bernie Sanders and John Kasich, respectively [622] [623] Electors in Maine conducted a second vote after one of its members voted for Sanders; the elector then voted for Clinton [624] Likewise, for the first time since 1896, [c] multiple faithless electors voted against the pledged qualified vice presidential candidate.\n\n\nDemocratic objections to vote certification\nOn January 6, 2017, a Joint Session of Congress was held to count the Electoral College votes, pursuant to the Electoral Count Act This count was unusual for the many unsuccessful objections raised by Democratic members of the House of Representatives, alleging voter suppression and foreign interference.\n\n\nHandling of illegal votes\nCritics alleged racial bias after comparing the different sentences handed down to two white people and one black person who were convicted of attempting to vote illegally in the 2016 presidential election [641]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2016 United States presidential election was the 58th quadrennial presidential election, held on November 8, 2016. The election was contested by two major party candidates, Republican Party nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton, as well as several third-party and independent candidates.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n\nArticle Two of the Constitution of the United States provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\n\nNominations\n------------\n\nWith seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history, before being overtaken by the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. The Republican Party held 17 primary debates, with 14 of them featuring Trump, while the Democratic Party held 12 debates, with 6 featuring Clinton.\n\nRepublican Party\n----------------\n\nThe Republican Party held its first debate on August 6, 2015, in Cleveland, Ohio, with ten candidates participating. The debate was broadcast on Fox News, and was moderated by Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace. The debate was seen by 24 million viewers, making it the most-watched cable news program in history at the time. The Republican Party held a total of 17 debates, with 14 of them featuring Trump.\n\nPrimaries\n----------\n\nThe 2016 Republican presidential primary began on February 1, 2016, with the Iowa caucuses, where Trump won by a margin of 2.6 percentage points over Ted Cruz. Trump went on to win the New Hampshire primary on February 9, 2016, by a margin of 19.6 percentage points over John Kasich. The primary season continued with Trump winning the South Carolina primary on February 20, 2016, by a margin of 10.5 percentage points over Cruz.\n\nDemocratic Party\n----------------\n\nThe Democratic Party held its first debate on October 13, 2015, in Las Vegas, Nevada, with 10 candidates participating. The debate was broadcast on CNN, and was moderated by Jake Tapper, Don Lemon, and Dana Bash. The debate was seen by 15 million viewers, making it the most-watched cable news program in history at the time. The Democratic Party held a total of 12 debates, with 6 featuring Clinton.\n\nPrimaries\n----------\n\nThe 2016 Democratic presidential primary began on February 1, 2016, with the Iowa caucuses, where Clinton won by a margin of 0.35 percentage points over Bernie Sanders. Clinton went on to win the New Hampshire primary on February 9, 2016, by a margin of 22.9 percentage points over Sanders.\n\nNominees\n---------\n\nThe Republican Party nominated Donald Trump on July 19, 2016, at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Trump won the nomination on the first ballot, with 1,725 delegate votes. The Democratic Party nominated Hillary Clinton on July 26, 2016, at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Clinton won the nomination on the first ballot, with 2,842 delegate votes.\n\nCandidates\n----------\n\nThe following candidates were frequently interviewed by major broadcast networks and cable news channels or were listed in publicly published national polls. Larry Lessig was invited to one forum, but withdrew when rules were changed which prevented him from participating in officially sanctioned debates.\n\nVice Presidential Selection\n-------------------------\n\nIn April 2016, the Clinton campaign began to compile a list of 15 to 20 individuals to vet for the position of running mate, even though Sanders continued to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries. In mid-June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's shortlist included Representative Xavier Becerra from California, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired Admiral James Stavridis, and Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado.\n\nMinor Parties and Independents\n-------------------------------\n\nThird party and independent candidates who obtained more than 100,000 votes nationally or on ballot in at least 15 states are listed separately. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein repeated their 2012 roles as the nominees for the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, respectively.\n\nLibertarian Party\n-----------------\n\nThe Libertarian Party nominated Gary Johnson on May 29, 2016, at the Libertarian National Convention in Orlando, Florida.

In March 2016, she laid out a detailed economic plan basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, which proposed a \"clawback\" that rescinds tax cuts and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; with provision of incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; as well as increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of the U.S in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.\n\nMedia Coverage\n----------------\n\nClinton had an uneasy—and, at times, adversarial—relationship with the press throughout her life in public service.

Even the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were narrowly won by Trump.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n---------------------\n\nThe 2016 election was the fifth and most recent presidential election in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote. Six states plus a portion of Maine that Obama won in 2012 switched to Trump (Electoral College votes in parentheses): Florida (29), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10), Iowa (6), and Maine's second congressional district (1). Initially, Trump won exactly 100 more Electoral College votes than Mitt Romney had in 2012, with two lost to faithless electors in the final tally. Thirty-nine states swung more Republican compared to the previous presidential election, while eleven states and the District of Columbia swung more Democratic. Based on United States Census Bureau estimates of the voting age population (VAP), turnout of voters casting a vote for president was nearly 1% higher than in 2012. Examining overall turnout in the 2016 election, the University of Florida's Michael McDonald estimated that 138.8 million Americans cast a ballot. Considering a VAP of 250.6 million people and a voting-eligible population (VEP) of 230.6 million people, this is a turnout rate of 55.4% VAP and 60.2% VEP. Based on this estimate, voter turnout was up compared to 2012 (54.1% VAP) but down compared to 2008 (57.4% VAP). An FEC report of the election recorded an official total of 136.7 million votes cast for president—more than any prior election.\n\nElectoral Results\n-----------------\n\nNotes:\n\nResults by State\n-----------------\n\nThe table below displays the official vote tallies by each state's Electoral College voting method. The source for the results of all states is the official Federal Election Commission report. The column labeled \"Margin\" shows Trump's margin of victory over Clinton (the margin is negative for every state that Clinton won). A total of 29 third party and independent presidential candidates appeared on the ballot in at least one state. Former Governor of New Mexico Gary Johnson and physician Jill Stein repeated their 2012 roles as the nominees for the Libertarian Party and the Green Party, respectively.\n\nStates and EV Districts that Flipped from Democratic to Republican\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost media outlets announced the beginning of the presidential race about twenty months prior to Election Day. Soon after the first contestants declared their candidacy, Larry Sabato listed Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, and Ohio as the seven states most likely to be contested in the general election. After Donald Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, many pundits felt that the major campaign locations might be different from what had originally been expected.\n\nBattleground States\n-------------------\n\nMost media outlets announced the beginning of the presidential race about twenty months prior to Election Day.

States must be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years [35] Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president [36]\n\n\nNominations\nWith seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history, [42] before being overtaken by the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries [43]\n\n\nRepublican Party\nWith seventeen major candidates

Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she faced strong challenges from independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, [95] who became the second major candidate when he formally announced on April 30, 2015, that he was running for the Democratic nomination [96] September 2015 polling numbers indicated a narrowing gap between Clinton and Sanders [95] [97] [98] On May 30, 2015, former governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley was the third major candidate to enter the Democratic primary race, [99] followed by former independent governor and Republican senator of

Clinton campaign began to compile a list of 15 to 20 individuals to vet for the position of running mate, even though Sanders continued to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries [124] In mid-June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's shortlist included Representative Xavier Becerra from California, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts [125] Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired

campaign finance reform, and improving the Affordable Care Act In March 2016, she laid out a detailed economic plan basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, which proposed a \"clawback\" that rescinds tax cuts and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; with provision of incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; as well as increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \"exit tax\" on companies that move their headquarters out of the U.S in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas [164] Clinton promoted equal pay for equal work to address current alleged shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do, [165] promoted explicitly focus on family issues and support of universal preschool, [166] expressed support for the right to same-sex marriage, [166] and proposed allowing

candidate, Clinton attended a political press corps event, pledging to start fresh on what she described as a \"complicated\" relationship with political reporters [179] Clinton was initially criticized by the press for avoiding taking their questions, [180] [181] after which she provided more interviews.\n\n\nControversies\nAccording to a wide range of representative polls, both Clinton

competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country [515] However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump [516]\n\n\nPost-election events and

for several days [557] [558] [559] [560]\n\n\nVote tampering concerns\nAfter the election, computer scientists, including J Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, urged the Clinton campaign to request an election recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania (three swing states where Trump had won narrowly) for the purpose of excluding the possibility that the hacking of electronic voting machines had influenced the recorded outcome [580] [581] [582] However, statistician Nate Silver performed a regression analysis which demonstrated that the alleged discrepancy between paper ballots and electronic voting machines \"completely disappears once you control for race and education level.\" [583] On November 25, 2016, the Obama administration said the results from November 8 \"accurately reflect the will of the American people.\" [584] The following day, the White House released another statement, saying: \"the federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyberactivity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day.\" [585] [586]\n\n\nRecount petitions\nOn November 23, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein launched a public fundraiser to pay for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, asserting that the election's outcome had been affected by hacking in those states; Stein did not provide evidence for her claims [589] [590] Changing the outcome of these three states would make Clinton the winner, and this would require showing that fewer than 60,000 votes had been counted for Trump which should have been counted for Clinton Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on November 25, [591] after which Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias said their campaign would join Stein's recount efforts in that state and possibly others \"in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" [398] [592] Stein subsequently filed for a recount in Pennsylvania on November 28, [593] and in Michigan on November 30 [594] Concurrently, American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente sought and was granted a partial recount in Nevada that was unrelated to Stein's efforts [400]\n\n\nElectoral College lobbying\n\n\n\nFaithless electors\nIn the Electoral College vote on December 19, for the first time since the ratification of the 12th Amendment, multiple faithless electors voted against their pledged qualified presidential candidate [b] Five Democrats rebelled in Washington and Hawaii, while two Republicans rebelled in Texas [621] Two Democratic electors, one in Minnesota and one in Colorado, were replaced after voting for Bernie Sanders and John Kasich, respectively [622] [623] Electors in Maine conducted a second vote after one of its members voted for Sanders; the elector then voted for Clinton [624] Likewise, for the first time since 1896, [c] multiple faithless electors voted against the pledged qualified vice presidential candidate.\n\n\nDemocratic objections to vote certification\nOn January 6, 2017, a Joint Session of Congress was held to count the Electoral College votes, pursuant to the Electoral Count Act This count was unusual for the many unsuccessful objections raised by Democratic members of the House of Representatives, alleging voter suppression and foreign interference.\n\n\nHandling of illegal votes\nCritics alleged racial bias after comparing the different sentences handed down to two white people and one black person who were convicted of attempting to vote illegally in the 2016 presidential election [641]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

William was the oldest of five sons and six daughters, born to Stuart Taylor and Martha Hickman [2] [3] [4]\nIn his autobiography, Story of My Life (1896), Taylor describes his grandfather, James, as one of five brothers who were \"Scotch-Irish of the Old Covenantor type\" who emigrated from County Armagh, Ireland, to the colony of Virginia, about one hundred and thirty years ago\" (i.e 1766) The Hickman family was of English ancestry and settled in Delaware in the late 1750s Both families \"fought for American freedom in the Revolution of 1776\", and afterward emancipated their slaves [2] [3] [c]\nTaylor’s father, Stuart, was a \"tanner and currier—a considered a mechanical genius of his times\"; his mother was \"mistress of the manufacture of all kinds of cloth\" Both parents, he says, were of \"powerful constitution of body and mind…their English school education quite equal to the average of their day\" [5] Taylor married Isabelle Anne Kimberlin on October 21, 1846 after waiting an mutually agreed upon arrangement that he would serve the church for four years \nTaylor had two sons and two daughters, Morgan Stuart, Oceana, William Jr., and Charles Reid  Only Morgan lived to see adulthood.\n\n\nConversion to Christ\nBefore William was ten years old, his grandmother had taught him the Lord's Prayer and explained that he could become a son of God At age ten he longed for this relationship, but was unsure how to obtain it, during which time he underwent a \"profound religious experience\", which was affirmed for him in 1841 at the age of twenty After overhearing the story of a poor Black man who had received salvation, he wondered why he could not, also [5] He recounts in his autobiography,\n\n\nMissionary work\nBetween 1849 and 1883, Taylor traveled to many parts of the world as an evangelist missionary His extensive missionary travels included Australia and South Africa (1863-1866); England, the West Indies, British Guiana, and Ceylon (1866-1870); India (1870-1875); South America (1875-1884); and Liberia, Angola, the Congo, Australia and Mozambique (1885-1896) [8] Taylor was committed to bringing salvation to those he deemed were in need of it, and to this end he wrote a work, entitled, Reconciliation, or, How to be saved, which he had first published in 1867 [9] To assist other preachers in this effort he also wrote the work, The Best Mode of Preaching the Gospel, published in 1859 [10]\n\n\nCalifornia\nTaylor's missionary career began in San Francisco, California in September 1849, the year after gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, resulting in the California gold rush Due to the thousands of people flooding into California the Methodist General Conference [d] deemed it necessary to send missionaries there to provide social work and religious services The first sent for this undertaking were Reverends William Taylor and  Isaac Owen [13] When Taylor arrived, and with no chapel for people to gather in and listen to sermons, Taylor preached the gospel in the streets to settlers, prospectors, Native Americans, Chinese immigrants, and to the sick and the poor, without receiving any salary He subsequently came to be known as \"California Taylor\" throughout his missionary career [14] [15]  In October 1849 Taylor acquired a lot next to the home of Reverend Hatler on Jackson Street who invited him and advanced him the money at no interest to build his own house [16] Thriving congregations also emerged at Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton, and Santa Cruz while the Gospel was also preached in many of the mining camps As the immigration increased so did the numbers in the congregations [13]\n\n\nEastern United States and Canada\nAt the end of  seven years of missionary service in California Taylor aspired to the idea of being an itinerant preacher After being granted a leave of absence from the General Conference he traveled through the United States for a brief period, preaching wherever the opportunity presented itself [32]  He spent three months in Philadelphia, during the summer of 1857, preaching in all the main Methodist churches in that city During autumn of 1857 Taylor visited New England for the first time and attended the New Market Camp Meeting, in New Hampshire Thereafter he visited Boston and sat in preaching at the church of Reverend Edward Taylor [33] [g] At the beginning of 1861  just before the Civil War broke out, he went to Canada and spent a year on a line of work where he preached and offered services at nine camp meetings for the next four years, where he was often favorably received [30] [32] [35]  Though Taylor's time in Canada was short lived he used his connections and time there to expand his religious-social network to include people from the British Methodist realm [36]\n\n\nEngland\nIn February 1862, Taylor was informed about the rising colonies in Australia from Dr James Brown who  had previously lived  in that colony Brown informed him that they were in great need of a clergy such as Taylor  could provide So inspired, Taylor left Canada by way of Sandy Hook on May 1, 1862, aboard the steamship Kangaroo first stopping for a term in Liverpool Without much delay  he went directly from Liverpool to the Wesleyan Conference, then in session at Camborne, Cornwall, and put up at a hotel Upon arrival to the Conference he submitted letters of introduction addressed to Reverend William Arthur, Dr Prest, president of the Conference, along with other distinguished members, and subsequently was cordially received At the Conference he listened to an oration from William Punshon While the Conference was in session, lasting several days, Taylor was invited to preach at the chapel on three occasions He also once preached on the street, and once to the miners a thousand feet down in Dalcoath Mine After the Conference Taylor visited Drogheda, Ireland, accompanied by Reverend William Crook and preached a week in his church [37] [38] [39] Taylor spent a total of eleven months visiting England and Ireland [40]\n\n\nAustralia\nTaylor had been encouraged by Reverend James Brown of Canada in 1861  to venture to Australia and look into the possibility of doing missionary work in that country [40] After further consideration Taylor set out for Australia In the spring of 1863, first making an extensive tour in Paris, Sicily and other points around the Mediterranean Sea [42] After a week long visit to Paris he boarded a steamer, the Massageries Imperialias, and made his way to Beirut and then Palermo, in Sicily  From there his ship proceeded through the Greek Isles in the Aegean Sea, stopping at the island of Syra, for a few days Accompanied by a dragoman Taylor's company made additional stops at Sidon, and Sarepta, then proceeded to Tyre  They arrived at the ancient city of Acre and while there ascended Mount Carmel, then spent time visiting Jerusalem [43]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nTaylor played an integral role in the Christian revival that swept South Africa in 1866 From 1863 to 1865 the prospect of religion was little felt, mainly due to unforgiving circumstances, which included drought that had brought ruin to farmers, which in turn impacted trade Along with lung-disease, compounded by the drought, that killed thousands of cattle and sheep, any thoughts of hope and religious pursuits were not likely [51] Taylor arrived in South Africa on March 30, 1866 by way of the ship the St Vincent, having anchored in Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope At this time docks and a break-water were under construction in response to a gale force storm that had reeked death and destruction some eleven months prior [52] [53]  Cape Town at this time had a population of 28,547, of which 15,118 were whites, about 12,500 Malays, and 1,000 Khoekhoe and Kafirs [2] [54]  Taylor found an ideal interpreter, Charles Pamla, a native then in training for the ministry [55] On Taylor's first Sabbath in Cape Town on April 1, he delivered sermons at two Wesleyan chapels [56] [53] [57] As Taylor continued to deliver sermons about the colony the revival spread in great proportion It is estimated that six thousand natives were converted to Christianity during this time [57]\n\n\nBarbados and British Guiana\nIn 1867, Taylor's wife, weary from all the traveling, decided to take the growing children back to California and resume their education Taylor's next assignment brought him to Bridgetown on the tiny island of  Barbados, where for three weeks he preached indoors and out in many of its towns Everywhere he went he was received with favor and glad tidings In his autobiography Taylor described the people of this island as \"...exceedingly kind and appreciative\" [60] [61] [62]\n\n\nIndia\nTaylor arrived in Bombay on November 20, 1870, to begin his missionary work on the self-supporting plan, continuing the missionary work first started by Reverend William Butler in 1856, and Bishop Thoburn [i] Taylor began his service by preaching to the English speaking people in the evenings, and to the Hindustani people of lower India, through an interpreter during the mornings Taylor's influence was immediate and well received.and greatly provided the impetus within the revival that was then occurring [64] [65] [66] [j]\n\n\nSouth America\nTaylor's calling to Chile [l] was inspired by his interest in establishing churches and schools in that country [78]  To serve in Chlie Taylor previously had recruited three groups of missionaries who arrived at different times The first party included A P Stonewall, William A Wright  and  Ira Haynes La Fetra, a Methodist missionary and graduate of Boston University School of Theology who founded the Santiago College in Chili in 1880.His brother Ira gave to the college a printing press with which they printed great volumes of religious literature in Spanish [79]\n\n\nCentral Africa\nThe Liberia Conference met January 28, 1884, at Cape Palmas, with Reverend C A Pitman presiding Reverend Daniel Ware was elected clerical delegate to the General Conference The members reported were 2,337, with 35 Sunday schools and 2,178 scholars On May 22 of that year Reverend Taylor was elected \"Missionary Bishop for Africa\" by the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church by a vote of two hundred and fifty votes out of three hundred and fifty-three, [o] and was also duly ordained along with other bishops [89] [90] [91] Dr W R Summers, Levin Johnson, Reverend Taylor and C L Davenport were received into the Conference, being designed for a field southward which Bishop Taylor afterward had opened [92] [93] [94] On January 29, 1885 Bishop Taylor presided over the Liberia Conference [95]\n\n\nFinal years and legacy\nAt the age of seventy-five, longing to be with  his family for his remaining years,  Taylor was relieved of his responsibilities by the General Conference in 1896 and was replaced by Joseph C Hartzel He returned to California to rejoin with his family, with whom he had often been separated because of his missionary work around the world  At the age of 81 Taylor died in Palo Alto, California on May 19, 1902, shortly after his 81st birthday [2] He had been called the “Flaming Torch” by the Africans [98] [99] In 1890, Reverend David Ela said of Taylor, \"Nothing more romantic than the “ Taylor movement ” has occurred in the history of the church since the crusades, and nothing better calculated to excite the imagination.\" [100]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

Ireland, accompanied by Reverend William Crook and preached a week in his church [37] [38] [39] Taylor spent a total of eleven months visiting England and Ireland [40]\n\n\nAustralia\nTaylor had been encouraged by Reverend James Brown of Canada in 1861  to venture to Australia and look into the possibility of doing missionary work in that country [40] After further consideration Taylor set out for Australia In the spring of 1863, first making an extensive tour in Paris, Sicily and other points around the Mediterranean Sea [42] After a week long visit to Paris he boarded a steamer, the Massageries Imperialias, and made his way to Beirut and then Palermo, in Sicily  From there his ship proceeded through the Greek Isles in the Aegean Sea, stopping at the island of Syra, for a few days Accompanied by a dragoman Taylor's company made additional stops at Sidon, and Sarepta, then proceeded to Tyre  They arrived at the ancient city of Acre and while there ascended Mount Carmel, then spent time visiting Jerusalem [43]\n\n\nSouth Africa\nTaylor played an integral role in the Christian revival that swept South Africa in 1866 From 1863 to 1865 the prospect of religion was little felt, mainly due to unforgiving circumstances, which included drought that had brought ruin to farmers, which in turn impacted trade Along with lung-disease, compounded by the drought, that killed thousands of cattle and sheep, any thoughts of hope and religious pursuits were not likely [51] Taylor arrived in South Africa on March 30, 1866 by way of the ship the St Vincent, having anchored in Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope At this time docks and a break-water were under construction in response to a gale force storm that had reeked death and destruction some eleven months prior [52] [53]  Cape Town at this time had a population of 28,547, of which 15,118 were whites, about 12,500 Malays, and 1,000 Khoekhoe and Kafirs [2] [54]  Taylor found an ideal interpreter, Charles Pamla, a native then in training for the ministry [55] On Taylor's first Sabbath in Cape Town on April 1, he delivered sermons at two Wesleyan chapels [56] [53] [57] As Taylor continued to deliver sermons about the colony the revival spread in great proportion It is estimated that six thousand natives were converted to Christianity during this time [57]\n\n\nBarbados and British Guiana\nIn 1867, Taylor's wife, weary from all the traveling, decided to take the growing children back to California and resume their education Taylor's next assignment brought him to Bridgetown on the tiny island of  Barbados, where for three weeks he preached indoors and out in many of its towns Everywhere he went he was received with favor and glad tidings In his autobiography Taylor described the people of this island as \"...exceedingly kind and appreciative\" [60] [61] [62]\n\n\nIndia\nTaylor arrived in Bombay on November 20, 1870, to begin his missionary work on the self-supporting plan, continuing the missionary work first started by Reverend William Butler in 1856, and Bishop Thoburn [i] Taylor began his service by preaching to the English speaking people in the evenings, and to the Hindustani people of lower India, through an interpreter during the mornings Taylor's influence was immediate and well received.and greatly provided the impetus within the revival that was then occurring [64] [65] [66] [j]\n\n\nSouth America\nTaylor's calling to Chile [l] was inspired by his interest in establishing churches and schools in that country [78]  To serve in Chlie Taylor previously had recruited three groups of missionaries who arrived at different times The first party included A P Stonewall, William A Wright  and  Ira Haynes La Fetra, a Methodist missionary and graduate of Boston University School of Theology who founded the Santiago College in Chili in 1880.His brother Ira gave to the college a printing press with which they printed great volumes of religious literature in Spanish [79]\n\n\nCentral Africa\nThe Liberia Conference met January 28, 1884, at Cape Palmas, with Reverend C A Pitman presiding Reverend Daniel Ware was elected clerical delegate to the General Conference The members reported were 2,337, with 35 Sunday schools and 2,178 scholars On May 22 of that year Reverend Taylor was elected \"Missionary Bishop for Africa\" by the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church by a vote of two hundred and fifty votes out of three hundred and fifty-three, [o] and was also duly ordained along with other bishops [89] [90] [91] Dr W R Summers, Levin Johnson, Reverend Taylor and C L Davenport were received into the Conference, being designed for a field southward which Bishop Taylor afterward had opened [92] [93] [94] On January 29, 1885 Bishop Taylor presided over the Liberia Conference [95]\n\n\nFinal years and legacy\nAt the age of seventy-five, longing to be with  his family for his remaining years,  Taylor was relieved of his responsibilities by the General Conference in 1896 and was replaced by Joseph C Hartzel He returned to California to rejoin with his family, with whom he had often been separated because of his missionary work around the world  At the age of 81 Taylor died in Palo Alto, California on May 19, 1902, shortly after his 81st birthday [2] He had been called the “Flaming Torch” by the Africans [98] [99] In 1890, Reverend David Ela said of Taylor, \"Nothing more romantic than the “ Taylor movement ” has occurred in the history of the church since the crusades, and nothing better calculated to excite the imagination.\" [100]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

suffered from internal conflicts, Louis Henno  [fr] was contested and certain players refused to play some matches In the field, the Northmen were way too irregular and crumbly in defense, and finished in 16th place [6] Lille were relegated for the first time in their history in 1956 This relegation is accompanied by aggravating financial consequences Best players' departure is necessary to

beating Rennes, Lille initially ended up to an unexpected 6th place The club then finished in eighteenth place the following season; being relegated a second time After a few years spent in Division

its professional status on 23 June 1969, lacking facilities and resources [6]\n\n\nReconstruction and reorganization (1978–2000)\nAfter years of back and forth, Lille finally returned to the top tier of French football at the end of the 1977–78 season Until 1997, the club remained in the first division, becoming a perennial member of the Division 1 In the 1978–79, the Mastiffs had a good run and ended at 6th place, nearly qualifying for European competitions while being promoted The following year, in July 1980, Lille was the first French club to opt for the status of a mixed economy company

Stade de France in 2005, the 2–0 triumph over Milan in San Siro in 2006 and the 1–0 home win over Liverpool in 2010.\n\n\nCampos and Galtier era: sustained success (2017–2021)\nIn early 2017, Lille appointed Luis Campos as sporting director and head of recruitment A short time afterwards, the club announced the arrival of Argentine famous manager Marcelo Bielsa In November 2017, Bielsa was suspended by Lille following an unauthorized trip to Chile with the club lying second from bottom on the table again and only managing 3 wins from the first 14 games of the season [19] On 23 December 2017, Bielsa was terminated by Lille and replaced with former Saint-Etienne manager Christophe Galtier [20] In a difficult 2017–18 season, Lille managed to avoid relegation to Ligue 2 by defeating

century, behind Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon and Marseille [35]\n\n\nIdentity and colours\nLille's crest has changed many times The first crest of the newborn club was simply the escutcheon of the city of Lille dating from 1235 that shows an argent-on-gules fleur-de-lys [41] The fleur-de-lys refers to the name and the insularity of the city \"Lille\", or \"Lile\" and \"Lysle\" depending on the past forms, is phonetically close to \"Lisle\", an old spelling of \"Lys\" The lys also makes reference to the water flag, which were rife through the marshes surrounding the city The colours of the heraldry, argent (white) and gules (red), embody wisdom and wealth for the first one, and passion and faithfulness for the second [42]\n\n\nCrest and nicknames\nLille's crest has changed many times

white jersey, with a large red \"V\" or chevron form around the neck and red sleeve ends, is inspired by the Olympique Lillois home jersey while the \"V\" shape comes from SC Fives kits as well as the blue shorts and socks White was the jersey primary color with little shades of red [48] The red chevron was part of each jersey until 1964 when it disappeared to give place to an immaculate white jersey that only kept red collar and sleeve ends [49] This jersey version, white with only few red shades around collar and sleeves, remains substantially the same for decades.\n\n\nGrounds\nAfter its foundation following the merging of Olympique Lillois and SC Fives, Lille alternately played its home games at the stadiums of both clubs: Stade Henri-Jooris of Olympique Lillois and Stade Jules-Lemaire of SC Fives [61] However, in 1949, the club chose to keep the first as his home ground and to use the second as a training ground [62] Becoming more and more obsolete, Stade Jules-Lemaire will be destroyed ten years later, in 1959 Named after Henri Jooris, the iconic president of Olympique Lillois, the 15,000-seat stadium, located by the Deûle river, near the Citadel of Lille, was the home of Les Dogues until 1975 when Lille moved at Stade Grimonprez-Jooris [63] [64]\n\n\nStadiums\nAfter its foundation following the merging of Olympique Lillois and SC Fives, Lille

The club's first season was a successful one, with Lille finishing in third place in the French Division 1.\n\nThe 1950s were a challenging period for Lille, with the club facing financial difficulties and struggling to maintain its top-flight status. However, the club's fortunes began to change in the 1960s, with Lille finishing in third place in the French Division 1 in the 1965-66 season. The club's success continued throughout the 1970s, with Lille finishing in second place in the French Division 1 in the 1976-77 season.\n\nIn the 1980s, Lille became one of the top teams in France, finishing in second place in the French Division 1 in the 1980-81 season. The club's success continued throughout the 1990s, with Lille finishing in third place in the French Division 1 in the 1996-97 season.\n\nIn the 21st century, Lille has continued to be a consistent presence in the top tier of French football.

The name can also refer to matches involving Lille and Valenciennes as both clubs are located within Nord, however, the match historically refers to matches involving Lille and Lens. As a result, the Lille-Valenciennes match is sometimes referred to as Le Petit Derby du Nord (French for \"The Little North Derby\").\n\n**Honours**\n\nDomestic:\n* French Ligue 1: 2020-21\n* French

the top level; Olympique Lillois and SC Fives Olympique Lillois were crowned domestic champions in 1932–33, the first in the history of the championship that was created in 1932, and were runners-up in 1935–36 [3] They also earned a USFSA Football Championship title in 1914, the French football top division before the creation of the French Division 1, and went to the Coupe de France final in 1939 Their neighbours, SC Fives, ranked second in 1933–34 [4] They also went to the Coupe de France final, being defeated by Girondins AS Port in 1941 [5] Weakened by the war, the two clubs decided to merge in the autumn of 1944, on 23 September, giving birth to Stade Lillois, renamed Lille Olympique Sporting Club a few weeks later [6] On 25 November 1944, the club is officially registered under its new name.\n\n\nFirst decade of glory : The War Machine (1944–1955)\nBefore the Second World War, the city of Lille had two clubs at the top level; Olympique Lillois and SC Fives Olympique Lillois were crowned domestic champions in 1932–33, the first in the history of the championship that was created in 1932, and were runners-up in 1935–36 [3] They also earned a USFSA Football Championship

Stade Lillois, renamed Lille Olympique Sporting Club a few weeks later [6] On 25 November 1944, the club is officially registered under its new name.\n\n\nDecline and several spells in lower levels (1955–1978)\nThe 1955–56 season happened to be highly complicated The club suffered from internal conflicts, Louis Henno  [fr] was contested and certain players refused to play some matches In the field, the Northmen were way too irregular and crumbly in defense, and finished in 16th place [6] Lille were relegated for the first time in their history in 1956 This relegation is accompanied by aggravating financial consequences Best players' departure is necessary to cover debts which are becoming substantial Failing to rebuild a top team due to the increasingly poor financial situation, the club began a series of promotions and relegations Promoted in 1957 by beating Rennes, Lille initially ended up to an unexpected 6th place The club then finished in eighteenth place the following season; being relegated a second time After a few years spent in Division 2, the club became a mid-table side in the late 1960s From 1964 to 1968, the club managed somehow to avoid relegation to the lower level After a long drought, the worst occurred when Lille abandoned its professional status on 23 June 1969, lacking facilities and resources [6]\n\n\nReconstruction and reorganization (1978–2000)\nAfter years of back and forth, Lille finally returned to the top tier of French football at the end of the 1977–78 season Until 1997, the club remained in the first division, becoming a perennial member of the Division 1 In the 1978–79, the Mastiffs had a good run and ended at 6th place, nearly qualifying for European competitions while being promoted The following year, in July 1980, Lille was the first French club to opt for the status of a mixed economy company (SAEMS), of which the city of Lille became the majority shareholder and turned the club into a public-controlled enterprise [12] The new financial sustainability allows the club's sporting stabilization in the elite division LOSC then achieved some success stories in the decade, reaching the Coupe de France semi-finals in 1983 and 1985 [6]\n\n\nBack to the top and new double (2000–2017)\nIn just its first season back in the top flight 2000–01 French Division 1, Lille qualified for Europe for the first time in the club's history, booking its place in the 2001–02 Champions League On the back of the club's new status, Lille entered into a decisive new era under the guidance of chairman and chief executive officer Michel Seydoux and coach Claude Puel The club left the historical Stade Grimonprez-Jooris to join the Stadium Lille Métropole and became a regular on the European scene Amongst its most emphatic results was the 1–0 victory over Manchester United at the Stade de France in 2005, the 2–0 triumph over Milan in San Siro in 2006 and the 1–0 home win over Liverpool in 2010.\n\n\nCampos and Galtier era: sustained success (2017–2021)\nIn early 2017, Lille appointed Luis Campos as sporting director and head of recruitment A short time afterwards, the club announced the arrival of Argentine famous manager Marcelo Bielsa In November 2017, Bielsa was suspended by Lille following an unauthorized trip to Chile with the club lying second from bottom on the table again and only managing 3 wins from the first 14 games of the season [19] On 23 December 2017, Bielsa was terminated by Lille and replaced with former Saint-Etienne manager Christophe Galtier [20] In a difficult 2017–18 season, Lille managed to avoid relegation to Ligue 2 by defeating Toulouse 3–2 in the second last game of the campaign [21]\n\n\nNew cycle and Fonseca's arrival (2021–present)\nIn the 2021–22 season, Lille won its first Trophée des Champions, defeating Paris Saint-Germain with a Xeka goal at Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv, Israel on 1 August 2021 [34] The Northmen then reached UEFA Champions League round of 16 and are defeated by Chelsea, after qualifying from the group stage against Salzburg, Sevilla and Wolfsburg According to an analysis  report published at the end of the Ligue 1 season, Lille is the fourth best French club in Ligue 1, in the 21st century, behind Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon and Marseille [35]\n\n\nIdentity and colours\nLille's crest has changed many times The first crest of the newborn club was simply the escutcheon of the city of Lille dating from 1235 that shows an argent-on-gules fleur-de-lys [41] The fleur-de-lys refers to the name and the insularity of the city \"Lille\", or \"Lile\" and \"Lysle\" depending on the past forms, is phonetically close to \"Lisle\", an old spelling of \"Lys\" The lys also makes reference to the water flag, which were rife through the marshes surrounding the city The colours of the heraldry, argent (white) and gules (red), embody wisdom and wealth for the first one, and passion and faithfulness for the second [42]\n\n\nCrest and nicknames\nLille's crest has changed many times The first crest of the newborn club was simply the escutcheon of the city of Lille dating from 1235 that shows an

(red), embody wisdom and wealth for the first one, and passion and faithfulness for the second [42]\n\n\nKits and sponsors\nBorn from the union of two teams, Lille OSC embraced different shirts elements and symbols of both founding clubs The first club's home kit was white and blue The white jersey, with a large red \"V\" or chevron form around the neck and red sleeve ends, is inspired by the Olympique Lillois home jersey while the \"V\" shape comes from SC Fives kits as well as the blue shorts and socks White was the jersey primary color with little shades of red [48] The red chevron was part of each jersey until 1964 when it disappeared to give place to an immaculate white jersey that only kept red collar and sleeve ends [49] This jersey version, white with only few red shades around collar and sleeves, remains substantially the same for decades.\n\n\nGrounds\nAfter its foundation following the merging of Olympique Lillois and SC Fives, Lille alternately played its home games at the stadiums of both clubs: Stade Henri-Jooris of Olympique Lillois and Stade Jules-Lemaire of SC Fives [61] However, in 1949, the club chose to keep the first as his home ground and to use the second as a training ground [62] Becoming more and more obsolete, Stade Jules-Lemaire will be destroyed ten years later, in 1959 Named after Henri Jooris, the iconic president of Olympique Lillois, the 15,000-seat stadium, located by the Deûle river, near the Citadel of Lille, was the home of Les Dogues until 1975 when Lille moved at Stade Grimonprez-Jooris [63]

Lille, the Domaine de Luchin has been the club's training ground since 2007 [83] A 43-hectare estate, it houses nine full-size pitches (including one artificial turf pitch), one goalkeepers training field, the club headquarters, the academy facility, classrooms and bedrooms as well as a medical pole, a fitness centre, press areas and the famous \"Dogue de Bronze\" (French for \"The Bronze Mastiff\"), a bronze statue of a mastiff which has been installed in 2011 and appeared in many pictures and videos of the club [84] [85] [86] The main pitch is a stadium of 1,000 spectators, including 500 seats, that can host matches for the academy and women's teams [84] [87] In March 2024, Lille OSC chose to rename this pitch after club legend Eden Hazard [88] The \"Terrain Eden Hazard\" (French for \"Eden Hazard pitch\") was inaugurated by the former Belgium captain in the company of his loved ones, ex-teammates, academy players and supporters groups [89]\n\n\nClub rivalries\nThe Derby du Nord (French for \"The North Derby\") is contested between Lille and RC Lens The derby name refers only to their geographical location in France; both clubs and cities only being located in the northern part of France, within the Hauts-de-France region but not the same department Being the fourth-largest city of the Pas-de-Calais department, Lens is located 30 kilometres south of regional prefecture and nerve centre Lille, Nord department main city The name can also refer to matches involving Lille and Valenciennes as both clubs are located within Nord, however, the match historically refers to matches involving Lille and Lens As a result, the Lille–Valenciennes match is sometimes referred to as Le Petit Derby du Nord (French for \"The Little North Derby\").\n\n\nHonours\nAs of 3

and three more breaks over 70 to win 9–1 [213] [214] At the World Snooker Championship, Murphy had another first round exit after losing to Noppon Saengkham 4–10 [215]\n\n\n2020–21 season\nMurphy reached the semi-finals of the European Masters in September, knocking out the defending champion Neil Robertson at the quarter-final stage, but was then himself defeated 3–6 by Mark Selby [216] He made a quarter-final appearance at the Masters in January where he was defeated by the same scoreline by Stuart Bingham [217]\n\n\n2021–22 season\nOn 24 November, following his  first-round loss to amateur player Si Jiahui in the 2021 UK Championship, Murphy commented, \"he  [Si] played like a man who does not have a care in the world, because he does not have a care in the world It is not fair, it is not right I am not picking on him as a young man, he deserved his victory Amateurs should not be allowed in professional tournaments, the end This is our livelihood This is how I put food on the table This is how I earn money Since turning professional at 15, I have earned the right to call myself a professional snooker player He hasn't done that He shouldn't be on the table.\" [221] He later regretted the timing of these comments and apologised to Si, [222] revealing in 2023 that he was \"in a dark place\" at the time of his \"out of character\" outburst [223] The highlight of his season was reaching the semi-final of the 2022 Turkish Masters, where he lost 6–2 to Judd Trump [224]\n\n\n2022–23 season\nAhead of the 2022–23 season, Murphy revealed he had undergone gastric sleeve surgery after years of weight fluctuation and associated injuries, fat shaming on social media, and a resurgence in over-eating after separating from his wife Elaine (although they later reconciled) [225] The move precipitated an upturn in form, starting with reaching the quarter-finals of the UK Championship (for the first time since 2017) where he was defeated 6–1 by Jack Lisowski [226] He had an impressive second half of the season, reaching the final of the 2023 Welsh Open where he narrowly lost 9–7 to Robert Milkins, [227] before winning the Players Championship in impressive fashion with a 10–4 win in the final over Ali Carter He made five centuries during the final including a highest break of 145 to seal his first ranking title since the 2020 Welsh Open [228] Just over a month later, he added the Tour Championship to his trophy collection, defeating Kyren Wilson 10–7 in the final despite being 4–0 down [229]\n\n\nRivalry\nMurphy has clashed with Stephen Maguire, another of the 2000 Young Players of Distinction, on several occasions At the start of their 2004 Grand Prix match, there was an incident that resulted in Maguire being docked the opening frame After they had shaken hands at the outset of the first frame, Maguire asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena and retrieve his chalk, which he had forgotten While Maguire was away, the referee and Murphy spoke before tournament director Mike Ganley arrived on the scene and docked Maguire a frame for technically not being ready to start at the scheduled time, which angered and surprised Maguire Murphy refutes that the docking of the frame was down to him speaking to the referee Maguire won the match 5–2 and later commented: \"Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before\" [233]\n\n\nPlaying style\nMurphy is noted for his straight cue action [13]—which Steve Davis once called \"the best cue action I've ever seen\" [13]—his long potting, [43] and his breakbuilding [43] Phil Yates wrote in 2008 in The Times that Murphy has improved his tactical game since his World Championship victory [82] He has compiled more than 600 century breaks and has made seven maximum breaks His career earnings amount to more than £3 million [239]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMurphy was born in Harlow and grew up in Irthlingborough He was home-schooled from age 13 after being bullied at school, [5] [13] and his parents split up when he was 14 He lived with his father Tony, a former professional golfer, and did not see his mother again until he was 19 [5] [240] During the 2007 World Championship, it was reported that he had developed a rift with his father, who was a member of the World Snooker board [241] [242] He said that they had not spoken in over a year, but that he would willingly speak to his father again if the other called him [242] In 2023, Murphy confirmed they were still estranged [230]\n\n\nPerformance and rankings timeline\n\n\n\nCareer

and a brother [10]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile a student at George Washington University, Abedin began working as an intern in the White House in 1996, assigned to then-First Lady Hillary Clinton From 1996 to 2008, she was an assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs [15] For several years, she served as the back-up to Clinton's personal aide She officially took over as Clinton's aide and personal advisor during Clinton's successful 2000 U.S Senate campaign in New York [3] and later worked as traveling chief of staff and \"body woman\" during Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination [2] According to a number of Clinton associates, Abedin is a trusted advisor to Clinton, particularly on the Middle East, and has become known for that expertise [3]\n\n\n2009–2013: State Department, Clinton Foundation, Teneo\nIn 2009, Abedin was appointed deputy chief of staff to Clinton in the State Department [16] After returning from maternity leave in June 2012, she left her position as Clinton's deputy chief of staff and became a special Government employee, a consultant role; this status allowed Abedin to work for private clients as a consultant while also serving as an adviser to the Secretary of State [17] Under this arrangement, she did consultant work for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm whose clients included Coca-Cola and MF Global, and served as a paid consultant to the Clinton Foundation, while continuing her role as body woman to Clinton The New York Times reported that an associate of Abedin's said the arrangement also allowed her to work from her home in New York City rather than at the State Department's headquarters in Washington to be able to spend more time with her child and husband [17]\n\n\nClinton's 2016 presidential campaign\nStarting in 2015, Abedin served as vice-chairperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for president, while continuing to serve as personal assistant to Clinton [4] In her role as the campaign's vice-chairperson, she screened and interviewed applicants for key campaign roles, including campaign manager Robby Mook, and was the primary channel for communications with Clinton before the campaign officially began After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States, Abedin wrote an email to Clinton supporters calling herself \"a proud Muslim\" and criticized Trump's plan as \"literally (writing) racism into our law books\" [19]\n\n\nMemoir\nAbedin wrote a memoir titled Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds, published in November 2021 [20] The book covers her childhood in Saudi Arabia, her Muslim faith, her time as an aide to Clinton and her relationship with her estranged husband, former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner [21] She has said that writing the book was a therapeutic process, helping her work through a tumultuous time as a result of Weiner's multiple scandals [22] In the memoir, Abedin also explores the multiple identities that have shaped her, in particular being born in Michigan and then raised in Saudi Arabia by a Pakistani father and an Indian mother [23]\n\n\nCongressional inquiries\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, raised questions about Abedin's work as a State Department employee, concerning the fact that she held four jobs [26] from June 2012 to February 2013 [27] [28] [29] These included serving as a part-time aide to Clinton at the State Department while also working as a consultant to private clients for the consulting firm Teneo Holdings, [27] [28] a consulting firm run by Douglas Band, a longtime aide to former president Bill Clinton [30] At the time, she was also being paid a salary for work at the Clinton Foundation, and working as Hillary Clinton's personal assistant [26] The State Department and Abedin both responded, with the State Department indicating that it uses special government employees routinely \"to provide services and expertise that executive agencies require\", and Abedin stating that she did not provide any government information or inside information gained from her State Department job to her private employers Grassley said he found the letters unresponsive [29] In July 2015, Grassley released information indicating that the State Department's inspector general had found that Abedin was overpaid by almost $10,000 for unused leave time when she left the government, resulting from violations of the rules governing vacation and sick leave during her tenure on the payroll as a Federal employee in the department [30] [31] Abedin's attorneys said that she had learned in May that the Department's inspector general had found that she improperly collected $9,857 for periods when she was on vacation or leave, responded with a 12-page letter contesting the findings, and formally requested an administrative review of the investigation's conclusions [30] Her lawyer, Miguel Rodriguez, told The New York Times that the inspector general's report showed that Abedin worked during her maternity leave and had thus earned the pay [32]\n\n\nOutside employment while at State Department\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, raised questions about Abedin's work as a State Department employee,

[36] resulting in various allegations by Republicans of violations of State Department regulations [37] Some officials within the intelligence community have stated that classified information was contained in e-mails from Abedin relating to the 2012 Benghazi attack and its aftermath, which had been sent through Clinton's private, non-government server [35] [38] [39] As of February 2016, 1,818 emails were found containing classified information on the private server; 22 of those were classified as Top Secret They were not marked classified at the time they were sent, but they did contain classified information Clinton's aides also sent and received classified information [40]\n\n\nHouse Benghazi Committee testimony\nOn October 16, 2015, Abedin testified in closed session before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, in a session that was expected to focus on the 2012 Benghazi attack during which Ambassador J Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed [41] The committee had previously heard closed-door testimony from two other Clinton aides, Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan, in September 2015, [41] and Clinton appeared before the panel in a public hearing on October 22 [42]\n\n\nMuslim Brotherhood allegations\nFive Republican members of Congress (Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Trent Franks of Arizona, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Thomas J Rooney of Florida, and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia) sent a letter dated June 13, 2012, to the State Department Inspector General The letter claimed Abedin \"has three family members—her late father, her mother and her brother—connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.\" [43] [44] [45] The letter further alleged Abedin had \"immediate family connections to foreign extremist organizations\" which were \"potentially disqualifying conditions for obtaining a security clearance\" and questioned why Abedin had not been disqualified for a security clearance [44]\n\n\n2015 State Department subpoena\nIn February 2016, The Washington Post reported that the United States Department of State had issued a subpoena to the Clinton Foundation in the fall of 2015 According to the report, the subpoena focused on documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from the federal government during Clinton's term as secretary of state; it also asked for records related to Abedin [48]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAbedin is a practicing Muslim [55] [56] In addition to English and Urdu, [14] Abedin also speaks fluent Arabic [57] [58]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nAbedin is featured in

{"title": "Theranos", "content": "\nHistory\nWhile at Stanford University, Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood [10] She started developing lab-on-a-chip technology for blood tests, with the idea to start a company that would make blood tests cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers [11] Holmes dropped out of Stanford in 2003 and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\" [12] [13] [14] The original name was \"Real-Time Cures\", [15] [16] [17] which Holmes changed after deciding that people were skeptical of the word \"cure\" [15]\n\n\nPartnerships\nIn 2012, Safeway invested $350 million into retrofitting 800 locations with clinics that would offer in-store blood tests After many missed deadlines and questionable results from a trial clinic at Safeway's corporate offices, the deal was terminated in 2015 [18] In 2013, Theranos partnered with Walgreens to offer in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations [19] Although Theranos blood tests were reportedly used on drug trial patients for GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, both companies stated in October 2015 that there were no active projects with Theranos [20] [21] In June 2016, Walgreens terminated its partnership with Theranos In November 2016, it filed a suit against Theranos in federal court in Delaware for breach of contract In June 2017, Theranos reported to investors that the suit, which originally sought $140 million in damages, was settled for less than $30 million [22] [23]\n\n\nExposure and downfall\nIn February 2015, Stanford professor John Ioannidis wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association that no peer-reviewed research from Theranos had been published in medical research literature [31] [32] In May 2015, University of Toronto Professor Eleftherios Diamandis analyzed Theranos technology and concluded that \"most of the company's claims are exaggerated\" [33] [34] Attempting to boost the company's credibility, Holmes invited then-U.S Vice President Joe Biden to tour their facility Biden praised what he saw, [35] but to conceal the lab's true operating conditions, Holmes and Balwani had created a fake lab for the Vice President's tour [36]\n\n\nShutdown\nOn September 4, 2018, Theranos announced in an email to investors that it would cease operations and release its assets and remaining cash to creditors after all efforts to find a buyer were fruitless Most of the company's remaining employees had been laid off on the previous Friday, August 31 However, Theranos general counsel and new CEO David Taylor and a few support staffers remained on payroll for a few more days Any equity investments in the company were made worthless by the shutdown [94] Theranos would later transfer its patents to Fortress Investment Group on September 12 in exchange for Theranos's cash assets to be distributed to creditors [2]\n\n\nCivil and criminal proceedings\nIn March 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Theranos, its CEO Elizabeth Holmes and former president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, claiming they had engaged in an \"elaborate, years-long fraud\" wherein they \"deceived investors into believing that its key product – a portable blood analyzer – could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood\" [95] [96] Holmes reached a settlement with the SEC which required her to pay $500,000, forfeit 19 million shares of company stock, and be barred from having a leadership position in any public company for ten years [97] Balwani did not settle with the SEC [98]\n\n\nTechnology and products\nTheranos claimed to have developed devices to automate and miniaturize blood tests using microscopic blood volumes Theranos dubbed its blood collection vessel the \"nanotainer\" and its analysis machine the \"Edison\" [110] [111] [112] Holmes reportedly named the device \"Edison\" after inventor Thomas Edison, stating, \"We tried everything else and it failed, so let's call it the Edison.\" This was likely because of a well-known Edison quote: \"I've not failed I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\" [113] The blood sample was to be collected via a finger prick and then transferred to the nanotainer through Theranos's sample collection device At just 12.9 millimetres (0.51 in) in height, the nanotainer held a couple of drops of blood [113]\n\n\nCorporate affairs\nThe company moved from 3200 Hillview Ave to the former headquarters of Facebook at 1601 S California Ave in June 2012 [124] [125] By 2017 Theranos was headquartered at 1701 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, paying a $1 million per month lease for the Stanford Research Park building [126] [127] It had laboratories in Newark, California, and Scottsdale, Arizona [128] In 2017, when Theranos was still denying its publicly reported fraud, the company vacated its Page Mill headquarters, moving remaining staff into the Newark, California, laboratories; Stanford University School of Medicine converted the Page Mill building to offices and medical laboratories [126]\n\n\nLocation\nThe company moved from 3200 Hillview Ave to

school, joined the company as its president and chief operating officer in 2009 [129] In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former U.S Secretary of State George Shultz, who joined the Theranos board of directors that month [130] Over the next three years, Shultz helped to introduce almost all the outside directors on the \"all-star board\", which included William Perry (former U.S Secretary of Defense), Henry Kissinger (former U.S Secretary of State), Sam Nunn (former U.S Senator), Bill Frist (former U.S Senator, senate majority leader and heart-transplant surgeon), Gary Roughead (Admiral, USN, retired), Jim Mattis (General, USMC), Richard Kovacevich (former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO) and Riley P Bechtel (chairman of the board and former CEO at Bechtel Group) [130] [131] [132] The

based in a rented basement near the Stanford campus [143] By December 2004, the company had raised more than $6 million from investors at a valuation of $30 million [144] The company had about $45 million total fundraising after Series B and Series C funding in 2006 [145] Theranos raised an additional $45 million in 2010 at a valuation of $1 billion [144] [146] The company had significant news coverage starting in September 2013 after profiles in the San Francisco Business Times and The Wall Street Journal [11] By 2014, Theranos had raised more than $400 million with an estimated value of $9 billion [147] Theranos raised more than $700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, [148] resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014 [15] [149] In 2016, Forbes revised the estimated net worth of the company to $800 million taking into account the $724 million of capital raised [9] Between 2004 and 2016, the amount of available cash from investors for private equity/venture capital firms to invest in companies grew from $400 billion to $1.5 trillion [150] It was a period of plentiful capital available where investors were pressured to find investment targets to deploy capital on In the Theranos case, insufficient due diligence and fraudulent business practices led to the losses for investors [151]\n\n\nBooks and documentaries\nJohn Carreyrou, a Wall Street Journal journalist whose work exposed Theranos, published a book-length treatment in May 2018 titled Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup [155] A film version was reportedly scheduled for release in 2020, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, written by Vanessa Taylor and directed by Adam McKay [156] [157] In January 2022, McKay stated that preparations for the film had resumed, and that Lawrence was working on learning Holmes's speech pattern [158] However, in November 2022, Lawrence announced she would no longer be involved with the project [159]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Theranos**\n\nTheranos was a privately held health technology company that developed

stating, \"We tried everything else and it failed, so let's call it the Edison.\" This was likely because of a well-known Edison quote: \"I've not failed I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\" [113] The blood sample was to be collected via a finger prick and then transferred to the nanotainer through Theranos's sample collection device At just 12.9 millimetres (0.51 in) in height, the nanotainer held a couple of drops of blood [113]\n\n\nCorporate affairs\nThe company moved from 3200 Hillview Ave to the former headquarters of Facebook at 1601 S California Ave in June 2012 [124] [125] By 2017 Theranos was headquartered at 1701 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, paying a $1 million per month lease for the Stanford Research Park building [126] [127] It had laboratories in Newark, California, and Scottsdale, Arizona [128] In 2017, when Theranos was still denying its publicly reported fraud, the company vacated its Page Mill headquarters, moving remaining staff into the Newark, California, laboratories; Stanford University School of Medicine converted the Page Mill building to offices and medical laboratories [126]\n\n\nLocation\nThe company moved from 3200 Hillview Ave to the former headquarters of Facebook at 1601 S California Ave in June 2012 [124] [125] By 2017 Theranos was headquartered at 1701 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California, paying a $1 million per month lease for the Stanford Research Park building [126] [127] It had laboratories in Newark, California, and Scottsdale, Arizona [128] In 2017, when Theranos was still denying its publicly reported fraud, the company vacated its Page Mill headquarters, moving remaining staff into the Newark, California, laboratories; Stanford University School of Medicine converted the Page Mill building to offices and medical laboratories [126]\n\n\nManagement\nFrom its incorporation in 2003 until 2018, Holmes was the company's chief executive officer She recruited Channing Robertson, a chemical-engineering professor at Stanford, to be a technical advisor and the company's first board member during its early years Holmes's then-boyfriend Ramesh Balwani, a software engineer whom Holmes had met during high school, joined the company as its president and chief operating officer in 2009 [129] In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former U.S Secretary of State George Shultz, who joined the Theranos board of directors that month [130] Over the next three years, Shultz helped to introduce almost all the outside directors on the \"all-star board\", which included William Perry (former U.S Secretary of Defense), Henry Kissinger (former U.S Secretary of State), Sam Nunn (former U.S Senator), Bill Frist (former U.S Senator, senate majority leader and heart-transplant surgeon), Gary Roughead (Admiral, USN, retired), Jim Mattis (General, USMC), Richard Kovacevich (former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO) and Riley P Bechtel (chairman of the board and former CEO at Bechtel Group) [130] [131] [132] The board was criticized for consisting \"mainly of directors with diplomatic or military backgrounds\" [11]\n\n\nValuation\nTheranos raised millions of dollars in its first years In 2004, Theranos was based in a rented basement near the Stanford campus [143] By December 2004, the company had raised more than $6 million from investors at a valuation of $30 million [144] The company had about $45 million total fundraising after Series B and Series C funding in 2006 [145] Theranos raised an additional $45 million in 2010 at a valuation of $1 billion [144] [146] The company had significant news coverage starting in September 2013 after profiles in the San Francisco Business Times and The Wall Street Journal [11] By 2014, Theranos had raised more than $400 million with an estimated value of $9 billion [147] Theranos raised more than $700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, [148] resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014 [15] [149] In 2016, Forbes revised the estimated net worth of the company to $800 million taking into account the $724 million of capital raised [9] Between 2004 and 2016, the amount of available cash from investors for private equity/venture capital firms to invest in companies grew from $400 billion to $1.5 trillion [150] It was a period of plentiful capital available where investors were pressured to find investment targets to deploy capital on In the Theranos case, insufficient due diligence and fraudulent business practices led to the losses for investors [151]\n\n\nBooks and documentaries\nJohn Carreyrou, a Wall Street Journal journalist whose work exposed Theranos, published a book-length treatment in May 2018 titled Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup [155] A film version was reportedly scheduled for release in 2020, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, written by Vanessa Taylor and directed by Adam McKay [156] [157] In January 2022, McKay stated that preparations for the film had resumed, and that Lawrence was working on learning Holmes's speech pattern [158] However, in November 2022, Lawrence announced she would no longer be involved with the project [159]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

"Paul George\n\nIntroduction\nPaul George is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was born on May 2, 1990, in Palmdale, California, and played college basketball for Fresno State University.\n\nEarly Life\nGeorge was born in Los Angeles County in Palmdale, California, and is the son of Paul George and Paulette George. He grew up with two older sisters: Teiosha, who played basketball at Pepperdine, and Portala, who played volleyball at CSU-San Bernardino. George idolized Lakers star Kobe Bryant and grew up rooting for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHigh School Career\nGeorge attended Knight High School in Palmdale, where he played for the school's basketball team. As a sophomore, he began the season on the JV team and was moved up to varsity after the season started. Recruiters began noticing George during the summer of 2007, when he competed in AAU tournaments. Sensing George's potential, his coach handed him a leading role his senior season. That year, George led Knight to the Golden League championship, and was named the Golden League Most Valuable Player, the Antelope Valley Press Player of the Year, and a member of the Daily News 2007–08 All-Area Boys' basketball team. He ended his senior year averaging 23.2 points and 11.2 rebounds.\n\nCollege Career\nGeorge played two years at California State University, Fresno, more commonly known as Fresno State. In his first game with the Bulldogs, he scored 14 points in a winning effort against Sacramento State. The following game, George recorded 25 points and 10 rebounds in a losing effort against Saint Mary's. Despite the loss, he made an impression with his one-handed slam dunk over Mickey McConnell that earned him SportsCenter's number 1 \"Play of the Day\" for November 18, 2008. On February 9, 2009, he scored a then-career-high 29 points to lead the Bulldogs to an 88–82 victory over Boise State. In the 2009 WAC tournament, the Bulldogs were matched up against Hawaii and advanced to the quarterfinal against the top-seeded Utah State Aggies. During the game, he forced a career-high 5 steals and finished with a team-high 16 points in a loss against the Bulldogs to a score of 85–68. With a 13–21 record, the team failed to qualify for the 2009 NCAA tournament. He led the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in minutes played (1,176) and finished second in 3-point shooting (44.7%), steals (59) and steals per game (1.74). His 3-point field goal percentage was the third-best in the Fresno State Bulldogs men's basketball program. He started all 34 games and finished the season averaging 14.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.7 steals per game on 47.0% from the field.\n\nProfessional Career\nOn March 31, 2010, George announced that he would forgo his final two seasons of college eligibility at Fresno State and enter the 2010 NBA draft. He made his first appearance on a 2010 mock draft on Draft Express a month into his sophomore season. By May 2010, mock drafts such as Draft Express, ESPN.com, and The Hoops Report predicted that George would be selected 12th overall by the Memphis Grizzlies. Two days before the draft, Marc J Spears from Yahoo! Sports wrote an article about an anonymous Eastern Conference scout stating that \"in five years, Paul George will be the best player to come out of this draft.\" Hoping to draft Derrick Favors, the Pacers had discussed a draft trade with the Nets that would have sent Danny Granger and the 10th pick to the Nets for Devin Harris, Yi Jianlian and the 3rd overall pick, but the deal fell through. George was invited to sit in the green room during the draft and was selected tenth overall by the Indiana Pacers. He became the highest NBA draft pick in Fresno State history. On July 1, 2010, he signed his rookie contract with the Pacers; a two-year guaranteed deal worth $3.9 million, with team options for a third and fourth year.\n\nIndiana Pacers (2010–2017)\nOn February 3, 2012, George recorded 30 points, 7 three-pointers made, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, 5 steals, and 1 blocked shot in a win against the Dallas Mavericks. George was selected to compete in the Slam Dunk Contest and Rising Stars Challenge during the 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend. In the Slam Dunk Contest, George completed a 360° windmill dunk in the dark and dunked over teammates Dahntay Jones and Roy Hibbert. The windmill dunk is when a player brings the ball below their waist and with an outstretched arm swings the ball into the rim. However, he lost the contest to Jeremy Evans. He finished the 2011–12 lockout-shortened season with averages of 12.1 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists on 44% shooting. George started all 66 games for the Pacers in the season. After beating the Orlando Magic, who were without Dwight Howard, in five games in the first round, the Pacers lost to the eventual NBA champions, the Miami Heat, 4–2 in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with George making just 19 of 52 field goals.\n\nDuring his first two seasons in the NBA, George played mostly the shooting guard position. However, with Danny Granger missing nearly the entire season due to knee and calf injuries, George began playing the small forward position and became the go-to offensive option for the Pacers in his third season. On November 21, 2012, George made nine three-pointers en route to a career-high 37 points in a victory against the New Orleans Hornets. The nine 3-pointers broke the franchise record for most 3-pointers made in a single game, surpassing Hall of Famer Reggie Miller. George was named the NBA's Player of the Week for the first time in his career in December, winning three straight games against Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Detroit. He recorded his first career triple-double in a victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on February 13, 2013, finishing with 23 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists and 2 steals. That same season, George was selected to play in the 2013 NBA All-Star Game in Houston for the first All-Star selection of his career. He recorded 17 points, 3 rebounds and 4 assists on 7-of-13 shooting in 20 minutes for the East in a loss against the West, 143–138. George averaged career highs of 17.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists, and was the only player in the league with at least 140 steals and 50 blocks. At the conclusion of the regular season, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player.\n\nOn September 25, 2013, the Indiana Pacers extended George's contract, electing him to be their designated player. The extension, which will start at the end of his rookie contract in 2014, is a \"5/30\" designated player extension (5 years and 30% of the salary cap), subject to passing the \"Derrick Rose\" test. George had to be elected to one further All-NBA team (at any level) or be the MVP during the 2013–14 season to qualify for the 30% extension. If he met either of these criteria, the 30% extension was estimated to be worth around $90 million over the 5-year deal. If he had failed to meet the criteria, he would be contracted at 25% of the salary cap.\n\n2014–15 season: off-season injury\nDuring the 2014 off-season, George was named to the training camp roster for the US national team that would represent the country at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. George had been considered a virtual lock to make the roster, but he landed awkwardly at the base of a basket stanchion after fouling James Harden during a Las Vegas scrimmage on August 1, and suffered a compound fracture of both bones in his lower right leg. After George was carted off the court, head coach Mike Krzyzewski addressed the arena stating the scrimmage would not continue out of respect to George and his family. George quickly went into surgery for the fracture, with a pin being inserted in the leg. While no official prognosis was initially given, he was considered likely to miss the entire 2014–15 season.\n\nGeorge, who had said he wanted to play at some time during the season, was cleared to put weight on the leg in late September, and was shooting jumpers in practice in late October. He participated in his first full practice of the season on February 26, three days earlier than expected. George made his return to the Pacers line-up for the first time since sustaining his leg injury with Team USA on April 5, 2015. He scored 13 points in 15 minutes and made two key three-pointers early in the fourth quarter, helping the Pacers defeat the Miami Heat 112–89. He played out the final six games of the season for Indiana, averaging 8.8 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.\n\n2015–16 season\nIn the Pacers' 2015–16 season opener against the Toronto Raptors on October 28, 2015, George recorded 17 points on 4-of-17 shooting and 12 rebounds in a 106–99 loss. After publicly criticizing the referees following the game, he was fined $10,000. On November 6, he scored 36 points in a 90–87 win over the Miami Heat. Three days later, he scored 27 points, including a career-high 19 points in the first quarter, to lead the Pacers to a 97–84 win over the Orlando Magic. On November 24, George scored 40 points and made seven three-pointers, part of a franchise-record 19 by the Pacers in a 123–106 victory over the Washington Wizards. On December 3, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in October and November. George led the Eastern Conference and ranked fourth in the NBA in scoring (27.2 ppg), helping the Pacers win 11 of 13 games after an 0–3 start. Two days later, he scored a career-high 48 points in a 122–119 overtime loss to the Utah Jazz. George competed for the Eastern Conference in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game in Toronto, where he started and was the game's leading scorer with 41 points, finishing one point shy of the All-Star game record set by Wilt Chamberlain (42) in 1962. On March 19, he had a 45-point game in a 115–111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. George helped the Pacers return to the playoffs in 2016, finishing as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference with a 45–37 record.\n\n2016–17 season\nIn the Pacers' season opener on October 26, 2016, George scored 25 points in a 130–121 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks. On November 1, he scored 30 points, including Indiana's final 12 of the game, to rally the Pacers to a 115–108 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. On December 10, he scored a then-season-high 37 points, including 13 straight in the fourth quarter, to lead the Pacers to a 118–111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On January 29, 2017, he scored 33 points in a 120–101 win over the Houston Rockets, matching a career high by topping the 30-point mark for the fourth straight game. On March 15, 2017, he made six three-pointers and scored 27 of his season-high 39 points in the second half of the Pacers' 98–77 win over the Charlotte Hornets. On April 2, 2017, he had a 43-point effort in a 135–130 double overtime loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On April 14, 2017, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for games played in April, averaging an NBA-high 32.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The Pacers went 5-1 during this stretch and were able to get a spot in the playoffs for the sixth time in the last seven seasons.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (2017–2019)\nOn July 6, 2017, George was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. The Thunder acquired him in spite of his pending free agent status the following year and George's stated preference to join the Los Angeles Lakers in his native Southern California. In his debut for the Thunder in their season opener on October 19, 2017, George scored a team-high 28 points in a 105–84 win over the New York Knicks.

other Democrats were strongly opposed to the measure, and President Obama said he would veto it if it passed [239]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSinema married, and later divorced, her BYU classmate Blake Dain [241] [21] She is bisexual [242] She has been reported to be the only atheist member of Congress, [243] [244] although she has rejected the label [70]\n\n\nAmateur athlete\nSinema has completed numerous marathons In 2019, she completed a marathon in 3:28:17, which was fast enough for her (female) age group to qualify for the Boston Marathon Two weeks before her Boston-qualifying race, she ran a three-mile race in 20:42, setting a record for women in Congress [245] In 2020, she set a personal record of 3:21:45 and later in 2021, she broke her right foot while running a marathon, requiring her to use a hands-free crutch [246]\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\nSelected works\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

uneventful The nomination process consisted of primaries and caucuses, held by the 50 states, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., U.S Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Democrats Abroad Additionally, high-ranking party members known as superdelegates each received one vote in the convention A few of the primary challengers surpassed the president's vote total in individual counties in several of the seven contested primaries, though none made a significant impact in the delegate count Running unopposed everywhere else, Obama cemented his status as the Democratic presumptive nominee on April 3, 2012, by securing the minimum number of pledged delegates needed to obtain the nomination [20] [21]\n\n\nDemocratic Party nomination\nWith an incumbent president running for

records in financing, fundraising, and negative campaigning Through grassroots campaign contributions, online donations, and Super PACs, Obama and Romney raised a combined total of more than $2 billion [83] Super PACs constituted nearly one-fourth of the total financing, with most coming from pro-Romney PACs [84] Obama raised $690 million through online channels, beating his record of $500 million in 2008 [85] Most of the advertising in the 2012 presidential campaign was decidedly negative—80% of Obama's ads and 84% of Romney's ads were negative [86] The tax-exempt non-profit Americans for Prosperity, a so-called \"outside group\", that is, a political advocacy group that is not a political action committee or super-PAC, ran a television advertising campaign opposing Obama described by The Washington Post as \"early and relentless\" [87] [88] Americans for Prosperity spent $8.4 million in swing states on television advertisements denouncing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 loan guarantee to Solyndra, a manufacturer of solar panels that went bankrupt, [89] an advertising campaign described by The Wall Street Journal in November 2011 as \"perhaps the biggest attack on Mr Obama so far\" [90] [91]\n\n\nParty conventions\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates held four debates during the last weeks of the campaign: three presidential and one

electoral vote) won by Republican Mitt Romney; blue denotes those won by Democrat Barack Obama.\n\n\nClose states\nRed denotes states (or congressional districts that contribute an electoral vote) won by Republican Mitt Romney; blue denotes those won by Democrat Barack Obama.\n\n\nStatistics\n [130]\n\n\nRomney's concession\nAfter the networks called Ohio (the state that was arguably the most critical for Romney, as no Republican had ever won the presidency without carrying it) for Obama at around 11:15 pm EST on Election Day, Romney was ready to concede the race, but hesitated when Karl Rove strenuously objected on Fox News to the network's decision to make that call [131] [132] However, after Colorado and Nevada were called for the President (giving Obama enough electoral votes to win even if Ohio were to leave his column), in tandem with Obama's apparent lead in Florida and Virginia (both were eventually called for Obama), Romney acknowledged that he had lost and conceded at around 1:00 am EST on November 7.\n\n\nReactions\nForeign leaders reacted with both positive and mixed messages Most world leaders congratulated and praised Obama on his re-election victory However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions Pakistan commented that Romney's defeat had made Pakistan-United States relations safer Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 each declining over two percent the day after the election [140]\n\n\nVoter demographics\nThe United States has a population of 50 million Hispanic and Latino Americans, 27 million of whom are citizens eligible to vote (13% of total eligible voters) Traditionally, only half of eligible Hispanic voters vote (around 7% of voters); of them, 71% voted for Barack Obama (increasing his percentage of the vote by 5%); therefore, the Hispanic vote was an important factor in Obama's re-election, since the vote difference between the two main parties was only 3.9% [142] [143] [144] [145]\n\n\nHispanic vote\nThe United States has a population of 50 million Hispanic and Latino Americans, 27 million of whom are citizens eligible to

therefore, the Hispanic vote was an important factor in Obama's re-election, since the vote difference between the two main parties was only 3.9% [142] [143] [144] [145]\n\n\nAnalysis\nCombined with the re-election victories of his two immediate predecessors, Bill Clinton (1996) and George W Bush (2004), Obama's victory in the 2012 election marked only the second time in American history that three consecutive presidents were each elected to two full terms after the consecutive two-term presidencies of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe ending in 1820, which is the only other time any two-term president succeeded another [149] Eight years later, Obama's successor, Donald Trump, also ran for his own re-election in 2020, but was ultimately defeated by Joe Biden, who served as vice president under Obama This was also the first election since 1928 in which neither of the major candidates had any military experience [150] The election was arguably decided by three counties: Miami-Dade County (Florida); Cuyahoga County (Ohio) and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) If these three counties had cast zero votes, Obama would have lost all three states and the election

The election saw the re-election of Democratic incumbent President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who defeated Republican challenger Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn 2011, several state legislatures passed new voting laws, especially pertaining to voter identification, with the stated purpose of combating voter fraud. However, these laws were attacked by the Democratic Party as attempts to suppress voting among its supporters and to improve the Republican Party's presidential prospects. Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia's state legislatures approved measures to shorten early voting periods. Florida and Iowa barred all felons from voting, while Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin state legislatures passed laws requiring voters to have government-issued IDs before they could cast their ballots.\n\n**Nominations**\n\nWith an incumbent president running for re-election against token opposition, the race for the Democratic nomination was largely uneventful. The nomination process consisted of primaries and caucuses, held by the 50 states, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., U.S Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Democrats Abroad. Additionally, high-ranking party members known as superdelegates each received one vote in the convention. A few of the primary challengers surpassed the president's vote total in individual counties in several of the seven contested primaries, though none made a significant impact in the delegate count. Running unopposed everywhere else, Obama cemented his status as the Democratic presumptive nominee on April 3, 2012, by securing the minimum number of pledged delegates needed to obtain the nomination.\n\n**Primaries**\n\nCandidates with considerable name recognition who entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination in the early stages of the primary campaign included U.S representative and former Libertarian nominee Ron Paul, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, who co-chaired John McCain's campaign in 2008, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the runner-up for the nomination in the 2008 cycle, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.\n\n**Withdrawn candidates**\n\nFour other parties nominated candidates that had ballot access or write-in access to at least 270 electoral votes, the minimum number of votes needed in the 2012 election to win the presidency through a majority of the electoral college.\n\n**Libertarian Party**\n\nThe Libertarian Party nominated Gary Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, as its presidential candidate. Johnson chose James P. Gray, a former judge, as his running mate.\n\n**Green Party**\n\nThe Green Party nominated Jill Stein, a physician and environmentalist, as its presidential candidate. Stein chose Cheri Honkala, a social worker and activist, as her running mate.\n\n**Constitution Party**\n\nThe Constitution Party nominated Virgil Goode, a former congressman from Virginia, as its presidential candidate. Goode chose Jim Clymer, a businessman, as his running mate.\n\n**Justice Party**\n\nThe Justice Party nominated Rocky Anderson, a former mayor of Salt Lake City, as its presidential candidate. Anderson chose Luis J. Rodriguez, a writer and activist, as his running mate.\n\n**Campaigns**\n\nThe United States presidential election of 2012 broke new records in financing, fundraising, and negative campaigning. Through grassroots campaign contributions, online donations, and Super PACs, Obama and Romney raised a combined total of more than $2 billion. Super PACs constituted nearly one-fourth of the total financing, with most coming from pro-Romney PACs. Obama raised $690 million through online channels, beating his record of $500 million in 2008. Most of the advertising in the 2012 presidential campaign was decidedly negative – 80% of Obama's ads and 84% of Romney's ads were negative.\n\n**Party conventions**\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates held four debates during the last weeks of the campaign: three presidential and one vice-presidential. The major issues debated were the economy and jobs, the federal budget deficit, taxation and spending, the future of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, healthcare reform, education, social issues, immigration, and foreign policy.\n\n**Electoral College forecasts**\n\nElections analysts and political pundits issue probabilistic forecasts of the composition of the Electoral College. These forecasts use a variety of factors to estimate the likelihood of each candidate winning the Electoral College electors for that state. Most election predictors use the following ratings: Safe Obama, Lean Obama, Toss-up, Lean Romney, and Safe Romney.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nOn the day of the election, spread betting firm Spreadex were offering an Obama Electoral College Votes spread of 296–300 to Romney's 239–243. In reality Obama's victory over Romney was far greater, winning 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206. Romney lost all but one of nine battleground states, and received 47% of the nationwide popular vote to Obama's 51%.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe table below displays the official vote tallies by each

contributions, online donations, and Super PACs, Obama and Romney raised a combined total of more than $2 billion [83] Super PACs constituted nearly one-fourth of the total financing, with most coming from pro-Romney PACs [84] Obama raised $690 million through online channels, beating his record of $500 million in 2008 [85] Most of the advertising in the 2012 presidential campaign was decidedly negative—80% of Obama's ads and 84% of Romney's ads were negative [86] The tax-exempt non-profit Americans for Prosperity, a so-called \"outside group\", that is, a political advocacy group that is not a political action committee or super-PAC, ran a television advertising campaign opposing Obama described by The Washington Post as \"early and relentless\" [87] [88] Americans for Prosperity spent $8.4 million in swing states on television advertisements denouncing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 loan guarantee to Solyndra, a manufacturer of solar panels that went

concession\nAfter the networks called Ohio (the state that was arguably the most critical for Romney, as no Republican had ever won the presidency without carrying it) for Obama at around 11:15 pm EST on Election Day, Romney was ready to concede the race, but hesitated when Karl Rove strenuously objected on Fox News to the network's decision to make that call [131] [132] However, after Colorado and Nevada were called for the President (giving Obama enough electoral votes to win even if Ohio were to leave his column), in tandem with Obama's apparent lead in Florida and Virginia (both were eventually called for Obama), Romney acknowledged that he had lost and conceded at around 1:00 am EST on November 7.\n\n\nReactions\nForeign leaders reacted with both positive and mixed messages Most world leaders congratulated and praised Obama on his re-election victory However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions Pakistan commented that Romney's defeat had made Pakistan-United States relations safer Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 each declining over two percent the day after the election [140]\n\n\nVoter demographics\nThe United States has a population of 50 million Hispanic and Latino Americans, 27 million of whom are citizens eligible to vote (13% of total eligible voters) Traditionally, only half of eligible Hispanic voters vote (around 7% of voters); of them, 71% voted for Barack Obama (increasing his percentage of the vote by 5%); therefore, the Hispanic vote was an important factor in Obama's re-election, since the vote difference between the two main parties was only 3.9% [142] [143] [144] [145]\n\n\nHispanic vote\nThe United States has a

Bush (2004), Obama's victory in the 2012 election marked only the second time in American history that three consecutive presidents were each elected to two full terms after the consecutive two-term presidencies of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe ending in 1820, which is the only other time any two-term president succeeded another [149] Eight years later, Obama's successor, Donald Trump, also ran for his own re-election in 2020, but was ultimately defeated by Joe Biden, who served as vice president under Obama This was also the first election since 1928 in which neither of the major candidates had any military experience [150] The election was arguably decided by three counties: Miami-Dade County (Florida); Cuyahoga County (Ohio) and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) If these three counties had cast zero votes, Obama would have lost all three states and the election [151]\n\n\nMaps\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

school of the Brazilian Army), which he entered in 1973 In 1974, he went to the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras (Brazil's main military academy), graduating in 1977 as an artillery officer He served in the 9th Field Artillery Group, in Nioaque, Mato Grosso do Sul Later he studied at the Army Physical Training School in Rio de Janeiro and served in the 21st Field Artillery Group and the 8th Paratrooper Field Artillery Group, from the Paratrooper Brigade, both in the same city His superior officers said he was \"aggressive\" and had \"excessive ambition to get financial and economical gain\" The assessment referred to Bolsonaro's attempt to mine gold in Bahia state; according to him, the activity was only a \"hobby and mental hygiene\" [8] [31]\n\n\nEarly political career\nBolsonaro entered politics in 1988, elected city councilor in Rio de Janeiro, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) According to the biography by his son Flávio, Bolsonaro \"was a candidate for councilor because it happened to be the only option he had at the moment to avoid persecution by some superiors His entry into politics happened by chance, for his desire was to continue in his military career\" [35]\n\n\nCouncilor of Rio de Janeiro (1989–1991)\nBolsonaro entered politics in 1988, elected city councilor in Rio de Janeiro, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) According to the biography by his son Flávio, Bolsonaro \"was a candidate for councilor because it happened to be the only option he had at the moment to avoid persecution by some superiors His entry into politics happened by chance, for his desire was to continue in his military career\" [35]\n\n\nFederal Deputy for Rio de Janeiro (1991–2018)\nIn the 1990 elections, Bolsonaro was elected a federal deputy for the Christian Democratic Party He served seven consecutive terms, from 1991 to 2018 He has been affiliated with several other Brazilian political parties over the years In 2014, he was the congressman who gained the most votes in Rio de Janeiro, with 465,000 [37]\n\n\nPresidential campaign (2018)\nOn 22 July 2018, the PSL nominated Bolsonaro for president in the 2018 election [45] The Brazilian Labour Renewal Party also endorsed him His coalition name was \"Brazil above everything, God above everyone\" (Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos) [46] [47] Though contested by two lawsuits, the Superior Electoral Court of Brazil deferred them and his candidacy was made official on 6 August [48] In August, Bolsonaro announced that Antônio Hamilton Mourão, a retired army general, would be his running mate [49]\n\n\nStabbing attack during campaign\nBolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen on 6 September 2018 while campaigning and interacting with supporters in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais [84] At first, his son Flávio Bolsonaro stated that his father's wounds were only superficial and he was recovering in the hospital, [85] but he later said the wounds seemed worse than initially thought [86] and his father most likely would not be able to start campaigning personally before the end of the first round [87] He tweeted about his father's condition, explaining that the perforation had reached parts of the liver, lung, and intestine He also said that Bolsonaro had lost a large amount of blood, arriving at the hospital with severe hypotension (his blood pressure was 10/3, equivalent to 100/30 mmHg), but that he had since stabilized [88] [89] [84] The attack was condemned by most of the other candidates in the presidential race, and by then president Michel Temer [90] The day after the attack, Bolsonaro was transferred to the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital in São Paulo, after a request from his family According to the doctors, he was in an \"extremely stable\" condition [91]\n\n\nPersonal motto\nBolsonaro's personal motto, which he established in 2016, is John 8:32: \"The truth will set you free\" [100] [101] [102]\n\n\nProtests\nThe same weekend he left the hospital, thousands of people took the streets in dozens of cities in Brazil to protest against Bolsonaro and his political stances, chanting \"Ele não\" (\"Not him\") [103] There were also rallies in support of the candidate in sixteen states [104]\n\n\nPresidency (2019–2023)\nBolsonaro was sworn in as President of the Republic on 1 January 2019, succeeding Michel Temer [105] Bolsonaro began to get his cabinet together before his inauguration, choosing economist Paulo Guedes as his Economy minister and astronaut Marcos Pontes as his Science and Technology minister [106] Bolsonaro initially said his cabinet would be composed of 15 members; this figure later rose to 22 when he announced his final minister, Ricardo Salles, in December His predecessor, Michel Temer, had a cabinet of 29 members [107]\n\n\n2022 presidential election\nIn a runoff presidential election on 30 October, Bolsonaro was defeated by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took 50.9% of the votes cast [158] Lula had won the most votes in the first round of the election on 2 October, receiving 48.43% of the votes cast: Bolsonaro received 43.20% [159] [160] In a press conference at the Palácio da Alvorada on 1 November, Bolsonaro did not acknowledge his defeat but stated that he would \"comply with the Constitution\" Regarding the protests by his supporters, he referred to them as \"the fruit of indignation and a sense of injustice of how the electoral process unfolded\", while calling on them to remain peaceful and not block roads Shortly after his speech, the Supreme Court stated that by authorizing the transition of power he had recognized the results, [161] [162] paving the way for the transition two days after Lula was recognized as the winner [163] [164] Bolsonaro left for the United States on 30 December to avoid taking part in the swearing-in ceremony of Lula, leaving Vice President Hamilton Mourão as the acting President [165]\n\n\nPost-presidency (2023–present)\nOn December 30, 2022, one day before Bolsonaro's term ended, he arrived in Florida and resided in Kissimmee for a couple of months [166] [167] On 8 January 2023, his supporters attacked the buildings of the Supreme Court of Brazil, the National Congress of Brazil and the Planalto Presidential Palace in an attempt to instigate a military coup d'état and reinstate Bolsonaro as president [168] While the riots were going on, President Lula blamed Bolsonaro in a press conference [168] [169] Bolsonaro condemned the protesters in a tweet on 9 January, [170] and denied responsibility [169] In February 2023, Bolsonaro announced that he would be returning to Brazil in March [171] This would be the first time Bolsonaro returned to the country since December 2022 [172] Bolsonaro had entered the United States on a diplomatic visa which expired on 31 January, but the family applied for tourist visas to extend their stay in Florida [173]\n\n\nCharges of coup planning and fraud\nOn 30 June 2023, the Brazilian Superior Electoral Court barred Bolsonaro from running for public office until 2030 as a result of his attempts to undermine the validity of Brazil's 2022 democratic election, as well as for abuse of power with regard to using government channels to promote his campaign [176] [177] The decision applies to municipal, state and federal elections for the next eight years He was prosecuted for several allegations of fraud in the 2022 Brazilian elections and situations linked to the January 8 attack on federal government buildings The decision came after a 5–2 vote in favor of conviction Following the decision, Bolsonaro stated his intentions to appeal [177] [178]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nBolsonaro's political views have been described as Brazilian nationalist and right-wing populist in nature, and he himself as an advocate of far-right politics [191] [192] His supporters say that his views are more aligned with traditional right-wing conservatism [193] His electorate is mainly formed by adults above the age of 34, the working middle to upper class (mainly in the southeast region of the country), conservatives in general, college graduates, some centrists and the Christian right [194] According to some polls, Bolsonaro's main support comes from the southeast, central-west, and south regions of Brazil His voters are usually male and white, with a noticeable gender gap, with Bolsonaro polling poorly among female voters (mustering only 18% support with this demographic) [103] [195] [196] Just before the 2018 election, however, it was reported that female support for him had risen to 27% [197]\n\n\nHonorific order given to Olavo de Carvalho\nOn 1 May 2019, Bolsonaro awarded Olavo de Carvalho, a Brazilian conservative writer and far-right conspiracy theorist, [225] [226] the Order of Rio Branco honorific order Carvalho, who wrote books about leftist politics in Brazil and modern issues in general, was openly admired by Bolsonaro and sarcastically called by journalists his guru [227] [228] [229] [230] Carvalho was sometimes harshly critical of Bolsonaro, even calling him \"dumb\" [231] [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nViews on the Brazilian military dictatorship\nThroughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made several admiring comments about the U.S.–supported Brazilian military dictatorship which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985 He said in 1993, eight years after the return of democracy, that the military regime had \"led to a more sustainable and prosperous Brazil\" [8] Bolsonaro has publicly referred to the military dictatorship as a \"glorious\" period in Brazil's history, [235] and that under the military dictatorship, Brazil enjoyed \"20 years of order and progress\" [235] In December 2008, Bolsonaro said that \"the error of the dictatorship was that it tortured, but did not kill\" [236]\n\n\nForeign policy\nDuring the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro said he would make considerable changes to Brazil's foreign relations, saying that the \"Itamaraty needs to be in service of the values that were always associated with the Brazilian people\" He also said that the country should stop \"praising dictators\" and attacking democracies, such as the United States, Israel and Italy [249] In early 2018, he affirmed that his \"trip to the five democratic countries the United States, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan showed who we will be and we would like to join good people\" Bolsonaro showed distrust towards China throughout the presidential campaign claiming they \" [want to] buy Brazil\", [250] [251] although Brazil recorded a US$20 billion trade surplus with China in 2018, and China is only the 13th largest source of foreign direct investment into Brazil [252] Bolsonaro said he wished to continue to do business with the Chinese but he also said that Brazil should \"make better  [economic] deals\" with other countries, with no \"ideological agenda\" behind it [200] His stance towards China has also been interpreted by some [who?] as an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration to garner concessions from the US [252] However, Bolsonaro mostly changed his position on China after he took office, saying that the two countries were \"born to walk together\" during his visit to Beijing in October 2019 [253] [254] He also said that Brazil would stay out of the ongoing China-U.S trade war [253] According to Oliver Stuenkel, Bolsonaro's stance on global politics evolved from anti-China to anti-Western during his presidency [255] In 2022, he praised the role of BRICS during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and described BRICS cooperation as a \"factor of stability and prosperity in the international situation\" [21]\n\n\nEnvironment and climate change\nBrazil has the world's largest tropical rainforest in the Amazon basin According to The Washington Post, \"Bolsonaro is a powerful supporter of agribusiness .. and is likely to favor profits over preservation .. Bolsonaro has chafed at foreign pressure to safeguard the Amazon rainforest, and he served notice to international nonprofit groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature that he will not tolerate their agendas in Brazil He has also come out strongly against lands reserved for indigenous tribes Bolsonaro advisers additionally say that he plans to expand nuclear and hydroelectric power into the Amazon.\" [5]\n\n\nChristianity and secularism\nBolsonaro is a member of the Catholic Church (while his wife and one of his sons are Evangelical Christians) [300] and is registered as one with the Superior Electoral Court In 2016, he had himself baptised along with three of his sons Flávio, Carlos and Eduardo in the Jordan River by a Pentecostal church Sociologist Christina Vital of the Fluminense Federal University stated that this act was more than an expression of conversion to Evangelicalism and was meant to create an ambiguous religious identity, through which the Bolsonaro family could appeal to the various groups of voters [301]\n\n\nViews on women\nIn an interview with Zero Hora in 2015, Bolsonaro argued that men and women should not receive the same salaries, because women get pregnant, adding that he believes federal law mandating paid maternity leave harms work productivity [305] Bolsonaro has denied saying that women should receive less than men; he claims it was statistical data by IBGE [306] In a public speech in April 2017, Bolsonaro said he had five children, that the first four were male and that for the fifth he produced a daughter out of \"a moment of weakness\" [307]\n\n\nViews on homosexuality\nIn May 2002, after then-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attended a pro-gay-marriage gathering, Bolsonaro said, \"If I see two men kissing in the street, I will beat them.\" [315] He later publicly defended beating gay children, saying, \"If your child starts to become like that, a little bit gay, you take a whip and you change their behavior.\" He also said, \"If a kid hangs out with someone who uses marijuana, he'll end up snorting, and if he hangs out with gay person, he definitely is going to turn into a faggot.\" [316]\n\n\nViews on political violence\nOn multiple occasions, Bolsonaro has publicly endorsed physical violence as a legitimate and necessary form of political action In 1999, when he was 44 years old and a representative in the Brazilian Congress, Bolsonaro said during a TV interview that the only way of \"changing\" Brazil was by \"killing thirty thousand people, beginning with Fernando Henrique Cardoso\" (then President of Brazil) [326] During the 2018 campaign, he stated during a rally in Acre that the local \"petralhas\" (a derogatory term for members of the Workers' Party) would be \"shot\"; according to his aides, the statement was a \"joke\" [327] One week before the second round, Bolsonaro said during a speech that in his administration \"petralhas\" and \"reds\" (i.e leftists) would be arrested, purged or taken to the \"corner of the beach\", a term that was later revealed to mean a Navy base where dissidents of the Brazilian military dictatorship were murdered [66]\n\n\nViews on race\nThroughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made numerous statements that have been described as racist [330] In 2011, when asked by Afro-Brazilian singer Preta Gil on TV show Custe o Que Custar (CQC) what he would do if one of his sons had a Black girlfriend, he answered that he \"would not discuss promiscuity\" and that there was \"no such risk\", because his children were \"very well educated\" Bolsonaro later claimed that he was misunderstood and denied promoting racism, although he stood by his attacks on gay people [331]\n\n\nBirth control for the poor\nBolsonaro provoked considerable controversy for public remarks made in July 2008, where he proposed to provide poor people with birth control methods, who he suggested might be too uneducated to understand family planning education Bolsonaro said:\n\n\nElections\nBolsonaro has endorsed conspiracy theories of voter fraud in past elections, including claims that attempts were made to rig the 2018 presidential election against him; [340] he has also questioned the outcome of the 2020 United States presidential election [341] During his presidency, he has repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of electronic voting and advocated the use of paper ballots in the 2022 election [342] Bolsonaro said that he would not accept the results of the 2022 election if electoral reforms were not implemented [341] [343] Most experts on Brazilian politics, including Defense Minister Celso Amorim, questioned the likelihood of a coup attempt, and polls found that few Bolsonaro supporters would likely endorse a coup [342] [341] In May 2022, Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns warned Bolsonaro against any further attacks on Brazil's electoral system [343] The 2022 election occurred days after the success of far-right politician Giorgia Meloni in the 2022 Italian general election, [344] with analysts noting that Bolsonaro performed better than expected during the first round of elections and that his party's success had the potential to moderate Lula's government if Lula won the election [345] [346]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBolsonaro has been married three times and has five children His first wife was Rogéria Nantes Braga (with whom he has three sons: Flávio, Carlos and Eduardo) His second marriage was with Ana Cristina Valle (with whom he has a son, Renan) In 2007, he married his third and current wife Michelle de Paula Firmo Reinaldo (with whom he has a daughter, Laura) [347] [348]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nNational honors\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nAwards\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nElectoral history\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nPresidential\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nChamber of Deputies\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nIndictment\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Jair Bolsonaro**\n\nJair Messias Bolsonaro is a Brazilian politician who served as the 38th President of Brazil from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2022.

article in English about \"Jair_Bolsonaro\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\n\nMilitary career\nIn his final years in high school, Bolsonaro was admitted to the Escola Preparatória de Cadetes do Exército (the prep school of the Brazilian Army), which he entered in 1973 In 1974, he went to the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras (Brazil's main military academy), graduating in 1977 as an artillery officer He served in the 9th Field Artillery Group, in Nioaque, Mato Grosso do Sul Later he studied at the Army Physical Training School in Rio de Janeiro and served in the 21st Field Artillery Group and the 8th Paratrooper Field Artillery Group, from the Paratrooper Brigade, both in the same city His superior officers said he was \"aggressive\" and had \"excessive ambition to get financial and economical gain\" The assessment referred to Bolsonaro's attempt to mine gold in Bahia state; according to him, the activity was only a \"hobby and mental hygiene\" [8] [31]\n\n\nEarly political career\nBolsonaro entered politics in 1988, elected city councilor in Rio de Janeiro, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) According to the biography by his son Flávio, Bolsonaro \"was a candidate for councilor because it happened to be the only option he had at the moment to avoid persecution by some superiors His entry into politics happened by chance, for his desire was to continue in his military career\" [35]\n\n\nCouncilor of Rio de Janeiro (1989–1991)\nBolsonaro entered politics in 1988, elected city councilor in Rio de Janeiro, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) According to the biography by his son Flávio, Bolsonaro \"was a candidate for councilor because it happened to be the only option he had at the moment to avoid persecution by some superiors His entry into politics happened by chance, for his desire was to continue in his military career\" [35]\n\n\nFederal Deputy for Rio de Janeiro (1991–2018)\nIn the 1990 elections, Bolsonaro was elected a federal deputy for the Christian Democratic Party He served seven consecutive terms, from 1991 to 2018 He has been affiliated with several other Brazilian political parties over the years In 2014, he was the congressman who gained the most votes in Rio de Janeiro, with 465,000 [37]\n\n\nPresidential campaign (2018)\nOn 22 July 2018, the PSL nominated Bolsonaro for president in the 2018 election [45] The Brazilian Labour Renewal Party also endorsed him His coalition name was \"Brazil above everything, God above everyone\" (Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos) [46] [47] Though contested by two lawsuits, the Superior Electoral Court of Brazil deferred them and his candidacy was made official on 6 August [48] In August, Bolsonaro announced that Antônio Hamilton Mourão, a retired army general, would be his running mate [49]\n\n\nStabbing attack during campaign\nBolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen on 6 September 2018 while campaigning and interacting with supporters in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais [84] At first, his son Flávio Bolsonaro stated that his father's wounds were only superficial and he was recovering in the hospital, [85] but he later said the wounds seemed worse than initially thought [86] and his father most likely would not be able to start campaigning personally before the end of the first round [87] He tweeted about his father's condition, explaining that the perforation had reached parts of the liver, lung, and intestine He also said that Bolsonaro had lost a large amount of blood, arriving at the hospital with severe hypotension (his blood pressure was 10/3, equivalent to 100/30 mmHg), but that he had since stabilized [88] [89] [84] The attack was condemned by most of the other candidates in the presidential race, and by then president Michel Temer [90] The day after the attack, Bolsonaro was transferred to the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital in São Paulo, after a request from his family According to the doctors, he was in an \"extremely stable\" condition [91]\n\n\nPersonal motto\nBolsonaro's personal motto, which he established in 2016, is John 8:32: \"The truth will set you free\" [100] [101] [102]\n\n\nProtests\nThe same weekend he left the hospital, thousands of people took the streets in dozens of cities in Brazil to protest against Bolsonaro and his political stances, chanting \"Ele não\" (\"Not him\") [103] There were also rallies in support of the candidate in sixteen states [104]\n\n\nPresidency (2019–2023)\nBolsonaro was sworn in as President of the Republic on 1 January 2019, succeeding Michel Temer [105] Bolsonaro began to get his cabinet together before his inauguration, choosing economist Paulo Guedes as his Economy minister and astronaut Marcos Pontes as his Science and Technology minister [106] Bolsonaro initially said his cabinet would be composed of 15 members; this figure later rose to 22 when he announced his final minister, Ricardo Salles, in December His predecessor, Michel Temer, had a cabinet of 29 members [107]\n\n\n2022 presidential election\nIn a runoff presidential election on 30 October, Bolsonaro was defeated by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who took 50.9% of the votes cast [158] Lula had won the most votes in the first round of the election on 2 October, receiving 48.43% of the votes cast: Bolsonaro received 43.20% [159] [160] In a press conference at the Palácio da Alvorada on 1 November, Bolsonaro did not acknowledge his defeat but stated that he would \"comply with the Constitution\" Regarding the protests by his supporters, he referred to them as \"the fruit of indignation and a sense of injustice of how the electoral process unfolded\", while calling on them to remain peaceful and not block roads Shortly after his speech, the Supreme Court stated that by authorizing the transition of power he had recognized the results, [161] [162] paving the way for the transition two days after Lula was recognized as the winner [163] [164] Bolsonaro left for the United States on 30 December to avoid taking part in the swearing-in ceremony of Lula, leaving Vice President Hamilton Mourão as the acting President [165]\n\n\nPost-presidency (2023–present)\nOn December 30, 2022, one day before Bolsonaro's term ended, he arrived in Florida and resided in Kissimmee for a couple of months [166] [167] On 8 January 2023, his supporters attacked the buildings of the Supreme Court of Brazil, the National Congress of Brazil and the Planalto Presidential Palace in an attempt to instigate a military coup d'état and reinstate Bolsonaro as president [168] While the riots were going on, President Lula blamed Bolsonaro in a press conference [168] [169] Bolsonaro condemned the protesters in a tweet on 9 January, [170] and denied responsibility [169] In February 2023, Bolsonaro announced that he would be returning to Brazil in March [171] This would be the first time Bolsonaro returned to the country since December 2022 [172] Bolsonaro had entered the United States on a diplomatic visa which expired on 31 January, but the family applied for tourist visas to extend their stay in Florida [173]\n\n\nCharges of coup planning and fraud\nOn 30 June 2023, the Brazilian Superior Electoral Court barred Bolsonaro from running for public office until 2030 as a result of his attempts to undermine the validity of Brazil's 2022 democratic election, as well as for abuse of power with regard to using government channels to promote his campaign [176] [177] The decision applies to municipal, state and federal elections for the next eight years He was prosecuted for several allegations of fraud in the 2022 Brazilian elections and situations linked to the January 8 attack on federal government buildings The decision came after a 5–2 vote in favor of conviction Following the decision, Bolsonaro stated his intentions to appeal [177] [178]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nBolsonaro's political views have been described as Brazilian nationalist and right-wing populist in nature, and he himself as an advocate of far-right politics [191] [192] His supporters say that his views are more aligned with traditional right-wing conservatism [193] His electorate is mainly formed by adults above the age of 34, the working middle to upper class (mainly in the southeast region of the country), conservatives in general, college graduates, some centrists and the Christian right [194] According to some polls, Bolsonaro's main support comes from the southeast, central-west, and south regions of Brazil His voters are usually male and white, with a noticeable gender gap, with Bolsonaro polling poorly among female voters (mustering only 18% support with this demographic) [103] [195] [196] Just before the 2018 election, however, it was reported that female support for him had risen to 27% [197]\n\n\nHonorific order given to Olavo de Carvalho\nOn 1 May 2019, Bolsonaro awarded Olavo de Carvalho, a Brazilian conservative writer and far-right conspiracy theorist, [225] [226] the Order of Rio Branco honorific order Carvalho, who wrote books about leftist politics in Brazil and modern issues in general, was openly admired by Bolsonaro and sarcastically called by journalists his guru [227] [228] [229] [230] Carvalho was sometimes harshly critical of Bolsonaro, even calling him \"dumb\" [231] [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nViews on the Brazilian military dictatorship\nThroughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made several admiring comments about the U.S.–supported Brazilian military dictatorship which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985 He said in 1993, eight years after the return of democracy, that the military regime had \"led to a more sustainable and prosperous Brazil\" [8] Bolsonaro has publicly referred to the military dictatorship as a \"glorious\" period in Brazil's history, [235] and that under the military dictatorship, Brazil enjoyed \"20 years of order and progress\" [235] In December 2008, Bolsonaro said that \"the error of the dictatorship was that it tortured, but did not kill\" [236]\n\n\nForeign policy\nDuring the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro said he would make considerable changes to Brazil's foreign relations, saying that the \"Itamaraty needs to be in service of the values that were always associated with the Brazilian people\" He also said that the country should stop \"praising dictators\" and attacking democracies, such as the United States, Israel and Italy [249] In early 2018, he affirmed that his \"trip to the five democratic countries the United States, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan showed who we will be and we would like to join good people\" Bolsonaro showed distrust towards China throughout the presidential campaign claiming they \" [want to] buy Brazil\", [250] [251] although Brazil recorded a US$20 billion trade surplus with China in 2018, and China is only the 13th largest source of foreign direct investment into Brazil [252] Bolsonaro said he wished to continue to do business with the Chinese but he also said that Brazil should \"make better  [economic] deals\" with other countries, with no \"ideological agenda\" behind it [200] His stance towards China has also been interpreted by some [who?] as an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration to garner concessions from the US [252] However, Bolsonaro mostly changed his position on China after he took office, saying that the two countries were \"born to walk together\" during his visit to Beijing in October 2019 [253] [254] He also said that Brazil would stay out of the ongoing China-U.S trade war [253] According to Oliver Stuenkel, Bolsonaro's stance on global politics evolved from anti-China to anti-Western during his presidency [255] In 2022, he praised the role of BRICS during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and described BRICS cooperation as a \"factor of stability and prosperity in the international situation\" [21]\n\n\nEnvironment and climate change\nBrazil has the world's largest tropical rainforest in the Amazon basin According to The Washington Post, \"Bolsonaro is a powerful supporter of agribusiness .. and is likely to favor profits over preservation .. Bolsonaro has chafed at foreign pressure to safeguard the Amazon rainforest, and he served notice to international nonprofit groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature that he will not tolerate their agendas in Brazil He has also come out strongly against lands reserved for indigenous tribes Bolsonaro advisers additionally say that he plans to expand nuclear and hydroelectric power into the Amazon.\" [5]\n\n\nChristianity and secularism\nBolsonaro is a member of the Catholic Church (while his wife and one of his sons are Evangelical Christians) [300] and is registered as one with the Superior Electoral Court In 2016, he had himself baptised along with three of his sons Flávio, Carlos and Eduardo in the Jordan River by a Pentecostal church Sociologist Christina Vital of the Fluminense Federal University stated that this act was more than an expression of conversion to Evangelicalism and was meant to create an ambiguous religious identity, through which the Bolsonaro family could appeal to the various groups of voters [301]\n\n\nViews on women\nIn an interview with Zero Hora in 2015, Bolsonaro argued that men and women should not receive the same salaries, because women get pregnant, adding that he believes federal law mandating paid maternity leave harms work productivity [305] Bolsonaro has denied saying that women should receive less than men; he claims it was statistical data by IBGE [306] In a public speech in April 2017, Bolsonaro said he had five children, that the first four were male and that for the fifth he produced a daughter out of \"a moment of weakness\" [307]\n\n\nViews on homosexuality\nIn May 2002, after then-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso attended a pro-gay-marriage gathering, Bolsonaro said, \"If I see two men kissing in the street, I will beat them.\" [315] He later publicly defended beating gay children, saying, \"If your child starts to become like that, a little bit gay, you take a whip and you change their behavior.\" He also said, \"If a kid hangs out with someone who uses marijuana, he'll end up snorting, and if he hangs out with gay person, he definitely is going to turn into a faggot.\" [316]\n\n\nViews on political violence\nOn multiple occasions, Bolsonaro has publicly endorsed physical violence as a legitimate and necessary form of political action In 1999, when he was 44 years old and a representative in the Brazilian Congress, Bolsonaro said during a TV interview that the only way of \"changing\" Brazil was by \"killing thirty thousand people, beginning with Fernando Henrique Cardoso\" (then President of Brazil) [326] During the 2018 campaign, he stated during a rally in Acre that the local \"petralhas\" (a derogatory term for members of the Workers' Party) would be \"shot\"; according to his aides, the statement was a \"joke\" [327] One week before the second round, Bolsonaro said during a speech that in his administration \"petralhas\" and \"reds\" (i.e leftists) would be arrested, purged or taken to the \"corner of the beach\", a term that was later revealed to mean a Navy base where dissidents of the Brazilian military dictatorship were murdered [66]\n\n\nViews on race\nThroughout his political career, Bolsonaro has made numerous statements that have been described as racist [330] In 2011, when asked by Afro-Brazilian singer Preta Gil on TV show Custe o Que Custar (CQC) what he would do if one of his sons had a Black girlfriend, he answered that he \"would not discuss promiscuity\" and that there was \"no such risk\", because his children were \"very well educated\" Bolsonaro later claimed that he was misunderstood and denied promoting racism, although he stood by his attacks on gay people [331]\n\n\nBirth control for the poor\nBolsonaro provoked considerable controversy for public remarks made in July 2008, where he proposed to provide poor people with birth control methods, who he suggested might be too uneducated to understand family planning education Bolsonaro said:\n\n\nElections\nBolsonaro has endorsed conspiracy theories of voter fraud in past elections, including claims that attempts were made to rig the 2018 presidential election against him; [340] he has also questioned the outcome of the 2020 United States presidential election [341] During his presidency, he has repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of electronic voting and advocated the use of paper ballots in the 2022 election [342] Bolsonaro said that he would not accept the results of the 2022 election if electoral reforms were not implemented [341] [343] Most experts on Brazilian politics, including Defense Minister Celso Amorim, questioned the likelihood of a coup attempt, and polls found that few Bolsonaro supporters would likely endorse a coup [342] [341] In May 2022, Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns warned Bolsonaro against any further attacks on Brazil's electoral system [343] The 2022 election occurred days after the success of far-right politician Giorgia Meloni in the 2022 Italian general election, [344] with analysts noting that Bolsonaro performed better than expected during the first round of elections and that his party's success had the potential to moderate Lula's government if Lula won the election [345] [346]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBolsonaro has been married three times and has five children His first wife was Rogéria Nantes Braga (with whom he has three sons: Flávio, Carlos and Eduardo) His second marriage was with Ana Cristina Valle (with whom he has a son, Renan) In 2007, he married his third and current wife Michelle de Paula Firmo Reinaldo (with whom he has a daughter, Laura) [347] [348]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nNational honors\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nAwards\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nElectoral history\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nPresidential\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nChamber of Deputies\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nIndictment\nIn July 2024, Brazil's Federal Police charged Jair Bolsonaro with money laundering and criminal conspiracy related to undeclared diamonds that he allegedly received from Saudi Arabia while he was in office [379]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

England There has certainly not been a player under 20 as good as him since I became a manager here.\"\n\n\nManchester United\nIn July 2004, Everton offered Rooney a new five-year contract valued at £50,000 per week, [58] the most lucrative ever offered by the club [59] Amidst increasing speculation linking Rooney with a transfer, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright admitted the club's financial situation meant a transfer would \"revitalise\" the club [60] Everton rejected a bid of £20 million from Newcastle, [61] and Rooney submitted a transfer request on 27 August, [62] with Moyes saying he

[66] Sir Alex Ferguson, then manager of United, said that \"There were plenty of eyebrows raised\" when he persuaded the club's board of directors to sanction \"a multi-million pound\" move to try to sign Rooney from Everton [67] In an appearance on United's official podcast in 2020, Rooney revealed Everton had wanted him to sign for Chelsea to ensure a bigger transfer fee, [68] while the mooted transfer to Newcastle would have seen a clause put in place for him to leave after a year to join United [69]\n\n\n2004–2007: Adapting to the Red Devils\nIn July 2004, Everton offered Rooney a new

draw against Reading on 12 August, [97] the same injury he had suffered to his right foot in 2004 [98] After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned and scored in United's 1–0 Champions League

conference that Rooney wanted to quit the club [132] This came after a period of dispute as to the extent of Rooney's ankle injury, where Rooney had refuted Ferguson's claim that the injury was the reason Rooney had been dropped to the bench [133] Rooney and his representatives released a statement regarding his decision to leave the club, insisting it was not down to money but ambition [134]

At the age of nine, he played for Copplehouse boys' club in the local Walton and Kirkdale junior league and scored 99 goals in his final season before being spotted by Everton scout Bob Pendleton.

Burlsworth**\n\nBrandon Burlsworth was an American football player who played as an offensive lineman for the University of Arkansas Razorbacks. He is best known for his inspirational story of overcoming physical limitations and achieving success through hard work and determination.\n\n**American Football Career**\n\nBurlsworth graduated in 1994 from Harrison High School, where he was an All-State selection. Despite having scholarship offers from smaller universities, he volunteered as a walk-on football player to the University of Arkansas. At the time, Burlsworth weighed around 245 pounds, but was told by then-Razorbacks offensive line coach Mike Bender that linemen had to be over 300 pounds. In response, Burlsworth ate extensively and came back over the 300-pound mark in a portly shape.\n\nHowever, Burlsworth soon slimmed his unathletic 300-pound frame down to a stronger, leaner 260 pounds, and over the next two years, built himself up to a bulky 300-pound offensive guard. By his sophomore season in 1996, he had earned a scholarship and a starting position at right guard on the offensive line.\n\n**Death**\n\nEleven days after being drafted, Burlsworth was killed in a car accident near Alpena, Arkansas, on April 28, 1999, on his way back to his hometown of Harrison after a workout in Fayetteville. Burlsworth's vehicle clipped an oncoming 18-wheeler, swerved back into his lane, and then hit another tractor trailer head-on. The stretch around Carrollton in which the crash occurred was not particularly rugged. A state police report said that, \"for unknown reasons,\" Burlsworth's car drove left of the center line and hit the left front fender of a tractor trailer. After returning to its lane briefly, the car crossed the center line again and hit a second tractor trailer. Burlsworth was declared dead at the scene.\n\n**Tributes**\n\nAfter his death, family and friends established the Brandon Burlsworth Foundation in honor of his work ethic and Christian values. The Christian organization's mission is to support the physical and spiritual needs of children, in particular those children who have limited opportunities.

{"title": "Lebanon", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name of Mount Lebanon originates from the Phoenician root lbn (𐤋𐤁𐤍) meaning \"white\", apparently from its snow-capped peaks [22] [23] Occurrences of the name have been found in different Middle Bronze Age texts from the library of Ebla, [24] and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe name is recorded in Egypt as rmnn (Ancient Egyptian: 𓂋𓏠𓈖𓈖𓈉; it had no letter corresponding to l) [25]\nThe name occurs nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible as לְבָנוֹן Ləḇānon [26]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe Natufian culture was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC [32]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nDuring the 7th century, Muslims conquered Syria from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day Lebanon, under the Islamic Caliphate [40] In the era of Uthman's caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by Mu'awiya, a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon, prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population However, the mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices [35] Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant, the population's conversion from Christianity and Syriac language was gradual The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria The relative  isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the Levant As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several well-established sects and religions, notably, Maronites, Druze, Shiite Muslims, Ismailis, Alawites and Jacobites [41]\n\n\nOttoman rule\nIn 1516, Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire, with governance administered indirectly through local emirs [43] Lebanon's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and Jabal Amil.\n\n\nFrench Mandate\nAmidst the height of the First World War, the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and France, delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control [43] After the Allies emerged victorious in the war, the Ottoman Empire ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area Soon after the war, Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek, representing the Maronite Christians,  successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christian-dominated Mount Lebanon [43]\n\n\nPressure on German-occupied France\nLebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany [61] General Henri Dentz, the Vichy High commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces The United Kingdom, fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon [62]\n\n\nIndependence from Free France\nFollowing the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League of Nations or its successor the United Nations The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: \"The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.\" [64] So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained [65] The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.\n\n\nCivil War and occupation\nWith the 1970 defeat of the PLO in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their armed campaign against Israel The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.\n\nPost-war revolution and spillover of the Syrian conflict\nOn 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks and raids into Israeli territory, where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others [110] Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, resulting in the 2006 Lebanon War The conflict was officially ended by the UNSC Resolution 1701 on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, and the disarmament of Hezbollah [111] [112] Some 1,191 Lebanese [113] and 160 Israelis [114] were killed in the conflict Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes [115]\n\n\nNational crisis (2019–present)\nOn 17 October 2019, the first of a series of mass civil demonstrations erupted; [133] [134] [135] they were initially triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco and online phone calls such as through WhatsApp, [136] [137] [138] but quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of sectarian rule, [139] a stagnant economy and liquidity crisis, unemployment, endemic corruption in the public sector, [139] legislation (such as banking secrecy) that is perceived to shield the ruling class from accountability [140] [141] and failures from the government to provide basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation [142]\n\n\nGeography\nLebanon is located in West Asia between latitudes 33° and 35° N and longitudes 35° and 37° E Its land straddles the \"northwest of the Arabian Plate\" [177] The country's surface area is 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi) of which 10,230 square kilometres (3,950 sq mi) is land Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometres (140 mi) on the Mediterranean Sea to the west, a 375 kilometres (233 mi) border shared with Syria to the north and east and a 79 kilometres (49 mi) long border with Israel to the south [178] The border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called Shebaa Farms [179]\n\n\nClimate\nLebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops [178] [181] Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall, when measured annually in comparison to its arid surroundings, certain areas in north-eastern Lebanon receives only little because of the rain shadow created by the high peaks of the western mountain range [182]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn ancient times, Lebanon was covered by large forests of cedar trees, the national emblem of the country [183] Millennia of deforestation have altered the hydrology in Mount Lebanon and changed the regional climate adversely [184] As of 2012, forests covered 13.4% of the Lebanese land area; [185] they are under constant threat from wildfires caused by the long dry summer season [186]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism [205] The National Pact, erected in 1943, laid out a governing arrangement intended to harmonize the interests of the country's major religious groups [206] The President has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi’a Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox [207] [208] This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and to represent fairly the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government [209] [210]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nLebanon is divided into nine governorates (muḥāfaẓāt, Arabic: محافظات; singular muḥāfaẓah, Arabic: محافظة) which are further subdivided into twenty-five districts (aqdyah, Arabic: أقضية; singular: qadāʾ Arabic: قضاء) [222] The districts themselves are also divided into several municipalities, each enclosing a group of cities or villages The governorates and their respective districts are listed below:\n\n\nForeign relations\nLebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001, and both sides initialed the accord in January 2002 It is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the World Trade Organization.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has 72,000 active personnel, [223] including 1,100 in the air force, and 1,000 in the navy [224] The LAF is considered less powerful and influential than Hezbollah in Lebanon Hezbollah has 20,000 active fighters and 20,000 in reserves and is supplied with advanced weaponry, including rockets and drones from Iran [225] [226]\n\n\nLaw\nThere are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts [230] The Lebanese legal system is based on the French system, and is a civil law country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law [231] \nFor Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court [232]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nMale homosexuality is illegal in Lebanon [235] Discrimination against LGBT people in Lebanon is widespread [236] [237] According to 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center, 85% of Lebanese respondents believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society [238]\n\n\nEconomy\nLebanon's constitution states that 'the economic system is free and ensures private initiative and the right to private property' Lebanon's economy follows a laissez-faire model [240] Most of the economy is dollarized, and the country has no restrictions on the movement of capital across its borders [240] The Lebanese government's intervention in foreign trade is minimal [240] The Investment Development Authority of Lebanon was established with the aim of promoting investment in Lebanon In 2001, Investment Law No.360 [241] was enacted to reinforce the organisation's mission.\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe agricultural sector in Lebanon employs 20–25% of the total workforce, [253] and contributed 3.1% to the country's GDP, [254] as of 2020 Lebanon has the highest proportion of cultivable land in the Arab world [255] Major crops include apples, peaches, oranges, and lemons [14] A significant portion of the country's factories, approximately one-third, is dedicated to producing packaged food items, ranging from poultry to pickles [253] However, despite favorable conditions for farming and diverse microclimates, the country depends on food imports, constituting 80% of its consumption This is mainly attributed to the small scale of many farms, preventing the benefits of economies of scale [253] The ongoing economic crisis and devaluation of the Lebanese pound have also negatively impacted the agricultural sector, particularly through elevated costs for essential imports such as seeds and fertilizers This economic strain compounds existing burdens for farmers, including escalating debts and inefficient agricultural practices Consequently, farmers are observing a decline in revenues and encountering difficulties in meeting loan repayment obligations [253] [256]\n\n\nManufacturing and industry\nIndustry in Lebanon is mainly limited to small businesses that reassemble and package imported parts In 2004, industry ranked second in workforce, with 26% of the Lebanese working population, [246] and second in GDP contribution, with 21% of Lebanon's GDP [14]\n\n\nScience and technology\nLebanon was ranked 94th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 88th in 2019 [263] [264] [265] Notable scientists from Lebanon include Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah, Rammal Rammal, and Edgar Choueiri [266] [267]\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn the 1950s, GDP growth was the second highest in the world Despite having no oil reserves, Lebanon, as the Arab world's banking center [270] and among its trading center, had a high national income [271]\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry accounts for about 10% of GDP [280] Lebanon attracted around 1,333,000 tourists in 2008, thus placing it as 79th out of 191 countries [281] In 2009, The New York Times ranked Beirut the No. 1 travel destination worldwide due to its nightlife and hospitality [282] In January 2010, the Ministry of Tourism announced that 1,851,081 tourists had visited Lebanon in 2009, a 39% increase from 2008 [283] In 2009, Lebanon hosted the largest number of tourists to date, eclipsing the previous record set before the Lebanese Civil War [284] Tourist arrivals reached two million in 2010, but fell by 37% for the first 10 months of 2012, a decline caused by the war in neighbouring Syria [280]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Lebanon was estimated to be 5,592,631 in 2021, with the number of Lebanese nationals estimated to be 4,680,212 (July 2018 est.); [287] [288] however, no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive confessional political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups [289] Identifying all Lebanese as ethnically Arab is a widely employed example of panethnicity, as the Lebanese \"are descended from many different peoples who are either indigenous, or have occupied, invaded, or settled this corner of the world\", making Lebanon, \"a mosaic of closely interrelated cultures\" [c] [292]\n\n\nReligion\nLebanon is the most religiously diverse country in West Asia and the Mediterranean [311] Because the relative sizes of different religions and religious sects remains a sensitive issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932 [312] There are 18 state-recognized religious sects – four Muslim, 12 Christian, one Druze, and one Jewish [312] The Lebanese government counts its Druze citizens as part of its Muslim population, [313] although most Druze today do not identify as Muslims [314] [315]\n\n\nLanguage\nArticle 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that \"Arabic is the official national language A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used\" [1] The majority of Lebanese people speak Lebanese Arabic, which is grouped in a larger category called Levantine Arabic, while Modern Standard Arabic is mostly used in magazines, newspapers, and formal broadcast media Lebanese Sign Language is the language of the Deaf community.\n\n\nEducation\nAccording to surveys from the World Economic Forum's 2013 Global Information Technology Report, Lebanon has been ranked globally as the fourth best country for math and science education, and as the tenth best overall for quality of education In quality of management schools, the country was ranked 13th worldwide [333]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 7.03% of the country's GDP In 2009, there were 31.29 physicians and 19.71 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants [347] The life expectancy at birth was 72.59 years in 2011, or 70.48 years for males and 74.80 years for females [348] By the end of the civil war, only one-third of the country's public hospitals were operational, each with an average of 20 beds By 2009, the country had 28 public hospitals, with a total of 2,550 beds [349] At public hospitals, hospitalized uninsured patients pay 5% of the bill, in comparison with 15% in private hospitals, with the Ministry of Public Health reimbursing the remainder [349] The Ministry of Public Health contracts with 138 private hospitals and 25 public hospitals [350]\n\n\nMental health\nThe Asfouriyeh Hospital, founded in 1896 in Lebanon, is considered the first modern mental health hospital in the Middle East The devastating impact of the Lebanese Civil War led to the hospital's closure in 1982 [353]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Lebanon reflects the legacy of various civilizations spanning thousands of years Originally home to the Canaanite-Phoenicians, and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the Assyrians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Crusaders, the Ottoman Turks and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they \"share an almost common culture\" [354] Lebanese Arabic is universally spoken while food, music, and literature are deep-rooted \"in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms\" [354]\n\n\nArts\nIn visual arts, Moustafa Farroukh was among Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 20th century Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career [355] Many more contemporary artists are active, such as Walid Raad, a contemporary media artist residing in New York [356] In the field of photography, the Arab Image Foundation has a collection of over 400,000 photographs from Lebanon and the Middle East The photographs can be viewed in a research center and various events and publications have been produced in Lebanon and worldwide to promote the collection.\n\n\nLiterature\nIn literature, Kahlil Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi [357] He is particularly known for his book The Prophet (1923), which has been translated into over twenty different languages [358] Ameen Rihani was a major figure in the mahjar literary movement developed by Arab emigrants in North America, and an early theorist of Arab nationalism Mikhail Naimy is widely recognized as among the most important figures in modern Arabic letters and among the most important spiritual writers of the 20th century Several contemporary Lebanese writers have also achieved international success; including Elias Khoury, Amin Maalouf, Hanan al-Shaykh, and Georges Schéhadé.\n\n\nMusic\nWhile traditional folk music remains popular in Lebanon, modern music reconciling Western and traditional Arabic styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity [359] Lebanese artists like Fairuz, Majida El Roumi, Wadih El Safi, Sabah, Julia Boutros or Najwa Karam are widely known and appreciated in Lebanon and in the Arab world Radio stations feature a variety of music, including traditional Lebanese, classical Arabic, Armenian [360] and modern French, English, American, and Latin tunes [361]\n\n\nMedia and cinema\nThe cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, besides the dominant Egyptian cinema, [362] [363] that could amount to a national cinema [364] Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films with many films including Egyptian filmmakers and film stars [365] The media of Lebanon is not only a regional center of production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world [366] According to Press freedom's Reporters Without Borders, \"the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country\" [367] Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is \"at the core of a regional media network with global implications\" [368]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nLebanon celebrates national and both Christian and Muslim holidays Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar Greek Orthodox (with the exception of Easter), Catholics, Protestants, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December Armenian Apostolic Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning) Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture [369] Among the most famous are Baalbeck International Festival, Byblos International Festival, Beiteddine International Festival, Jounieh International Festival, Broumana Festival, Batroun International Festival, Ehmej Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival [369] [370] These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's Ministry of Tourism Lebanon hosts about 15 concerts from international performers each year, ranking 1st for nightlife in the Middle East, and 6th worldwide [371]\n\n\nCuisine\nLebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus The Lebanese national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul wheat  Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of mezze – small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled meat or fish In general, meals are finished with Arabic coffee and fresh fruit, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.\n\n\nSports\nLebanon has six ski resorts Because of Lebanon's unique geography, it is possible to go skiing in the morning and swimming in the Mediterranean Sea in the afternoon [372] At the competitive level, basketball and football are among Lebanon's most popular sports Canoeing, cycling, rafting, climbing, swimming, sailing and caving are among the other common leisure sports in Lebanon The Beirut Marathon is held every fall, drawing top runners from Lebanon and abroad [373]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n\nGeneral

north and east, Israel to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. With a surface area of 10,452 square kilometers, Lebanon is one of the smallest countries in the world. Despite its small size, Lebanon has a rich history, diverse culture, and a strategic location that has made it an important hub for trade and commerce.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name of Mount Lebanon originates from the Phoenician root lbn (𐤋𐤁𐤍) meaning \"white\", apparently from its snow-capped peaks. Occurrences of the name have been found in different Middle Bronze Age texts from the library of Ebla, and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh. The name is recorded in Egypt as rmnn (Ancient Egyptian: 𓂋𓏠𓈖𓈖𓈉; it had no letter corresponding to l). The name occurs nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible as לְבָנוֹן Ləḇānon.\n\n**History**\n\n**Antiquity**\n\nThe Natufian culture was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC. The Phoenicians, a Semitic-speaking people, established a powerful trading network and a mighty naval power that dominated the Mediterranean for over 1,000 years. The Phoenicians were also known for their skill in navigation, shipbuilding, and metalworking. They established colonies in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Mediterranean islands.\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nDuring the 7th century, Muslims conquered Syria from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day Lebanon, under the Islamic Caliphate. In the era of Uthman's caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by Mu'awiya, a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor. Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon, prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population. However, the mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices.\n\n**Ottoman rule**\n\nIn 1516, Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire, with governance administered indirectly through local emirs. Lebanon's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and Jabal Amil.\n\n**French Mandate**\n\nAmidst the height of the First World War, the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and France, delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control. After the Allies emerged victorious in the war, the Ottoman Empire ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area. Soon after the war, Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek, representing the Maronite Christians, successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christian-dominated Mount Lebanon.\n\n**Independence**\n\nLebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany. General Henri Dentz, the Vichy High commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.\n\n**Independence from Free France**\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in Europe, the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League of Nations or its successor the United Nations. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. When the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.\n\n**Civil War and occupation**\n\nWith the 1970 defeat of the PLO in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their armed campaign against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.\n\n**Post-war revolution and spillover of the Syrian conflict**\n\nOn 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks and raids into Israeli territory, where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others. Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, resulting in the 2006 Lebanon War. The conflict was officially ended by the UNSC Resolution 1701 on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, and the disarmament of Hezbollah.\n\n**National crisis (2019–present)**\n\nOn 17 October 2019, the first of a series of mass civil demonstrations erupted, triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco, and online phone calls. The demonstrations quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of sectarian rule, a stagnant economy, and endemic corruption in the public sector.\n\n**Geography**\n\nLebanon is located in West Asia between latitudes 33° and 35° N and longitudes 35° and 37° E. Its land straddles the \"northwest of the Arabian Plate.\" Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometers on the Mediterranean Sea to the west, a 375 kilometers border shared with Syria to the north and east, and a 79 kilometers long border with Israel to the south.\n\n**Climate**\n\nLebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy, while summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.\n\n**Environment**\n\nIn ancient times, Lebanon was covered by large forests of cedar trees, the national emblem of the country. Millennia of deforestation have altered the hydrology in Mount Lebanon and changed the regional climate adversely. As of 2012, forests covered 13.4% of the Lebanese land area, which is under constant threat from wildfires caused by the long dry summer season.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism. The National Pact, erected in 1943, laid out a governing arrangement intended to harmonize the interests of the country's major religious groups. The President has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi’a Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nLebanon is divided into nine governorates (muḥāfaẓāt, Arabic: محافظات; singular muḥāfaẓah, Arabic: محافظة) which are further subdivided into 25 districts (aqdyah, Arabic: أقضية; singular: qadāʾ Arabic: قضاء). The districts themselves are also divided into several municipalities, each enclosing a group of cities or villages.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nLebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001, and both sides initialed the accord in January 2002. Lebanon is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbors closer. Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the World Trade Organization.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has 72,000 active personnel, including 1,100 in the air force, and 1,000 in the navy. The LAF is considered less powerful and influential than Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah has 20,000 active fighters and 20,000 in reserves and is supplied with advanced weaponry, including rockets and drones from Iran.\n\n**Law**\n\nThere are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts. The Lebanese legal system is based on the French system, and is a civil law country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community.\n\n**Economy**\n\nLebanon's economy follows a laissez-faire model.

A significant portion of the country's factories, approximately one-third, is dedicated to producing packaged food items, ranging from poultry to pickles.\n\n**Manufacturing and industry**\n\nIndustry in Lebanon is mainly limited to small businesses that reassemble and package imported parts. In 2004, industry ranked second in workforce, with 26% of the Lebanese working population, and second in GDP contribution, with 21% of Lebanon's GDP.\n\n**Science and technology**\n\nLebanon was ranked 94th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 88th in 2019. Notable scientists from Lebanon include Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah, Rammal Rammal, and Edgar Choueiri.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn the 1950s, GDP growth was the second highest in the world. Despite having no oil reserves, Lebanon, as the Arab world's banking center and among its trading center, had a high national income.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nThe tourism industry accounts for about 10% of GDP. Lebanon attracted around 1,333,000 tourists in 2008, thus placing it as 79th out of 191 countries. In 2009, The New York Times ranked Beirut the No. 1 travel destination worldwide due to its nightlife and hospitality.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe population of Lebanon was estimated to be 5,592,631 in 2021, with the number of Lebanese nationals estimated to be 4,680,212 (July 2018 est.). However, no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive confessional political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups.\n\n**Religion**\n\nLebanon is the most religiously diverse country in West Asia and the Mediterranean.

"Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanon\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name of Mount Lebanon originates from the Phoenician root lbn (𐤋𐤁𐤍) meaning \"white\", apparently from its snow-capped peaks [22] [23] Occurrences of the name have been found in different Middle Bronze Age texts from the library of Ebla, [24] and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe name is recorded in Egypt as rmnn (Ancient Egyptian: 𓂋𓏠𓈖𓈖𓈉; it had no letter corresponding to l) [25]\nThe name occurs nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible as לְבָנוֹן Ləḇānon [26]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe Natufian culture was the first to become sedentary at around 12000 BC [32]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nDuring the 7th century, Muslims conquered Syria from the Byzantines, incorporating the region, including modern-day Lebanon, under the Islamic Caliphate [40] In the era of Uthman's caliphate (644–656), Islam gained significant influence in Damascus, led by Mu'awiya, a relative of Uthman, serving as the governor Mu'awiya sent forces to the coastal region of Lebanon, prompting conversions to Islam among the coastal population However, the mountainous areas retained their Christian or other cultural practices [35] Despite Islam and Arabic becoming officially dominant, the population's conversion from Christianity and Syriac language was gradual The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria The relative  isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the Levant As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and the existence of several well-established sects and religions, notably, Maronites, Druze, Shiite Muslims, Ismailis, Alawites and Jacobites [41]\n\n\nOttoman rule\nIn 1516, Lebanon became part of the Ottoman Empire, with governance administered indirectly through local emirs [43] Lebanon's area was organized into provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and Jabal Amil.\n\n\nFrench Mandate\nAmidst the height of the First World War, the Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916, a secret pact between Britain and France, delineated Lebanon and its surrounding areas as regions open to potential French influence or control [43] After the Allies emerged victorious in the war, the Ottoman Empire ultimately collapsed, losing control over the area Soon after the war, Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek, representing the Maronite Christians,  successfully campaigned for an expanded territory at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, also including areas with significant Muslim and Druze populations in addition to the Christian-dominated Mount Lebanon [43]\n\n\nPressure on German-occupied France\nLebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany [61] General Henri Dentz, the Vichy High commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through Syria to Iraq where they were used against British forces The United Kingdom, fearing that Nazi Germany would gain full control of Lebanon and Syria by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon [62]\n\n\nIndependence from Free France\nFollowing the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League of Nations or its successor the United Nations The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: \"The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.\" [64] So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained [65] The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.\n\n\nCivil War and occupation\nWith the 1970 defeat of the PLO in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their armed campaign against Israel The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.\n\nPost-war revolution and spillover of the Syrian conflict\nOn 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket attacks and raids into Israeli territory, where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others [110] Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon, resulting in the 2006 Lebanon War The conflict was officially ended by the UNSC Resolution 1701 on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, and the disarmament of Hezbollah [111] [112] Some 1,191 Lebanese [113] and 160 Israelis [114] were killed in the conflict Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes [115]\n\n\nNational crisis (2019–present)\nOn 17 October 2019, the first of a series of mass civil demonstrations erupted; [133] [134] [135] they were initially triggered by planned taxes on gasoline, tobacco and online phone calls such as through WhatsApp, [136] [137] [138] but quickly expanded into a country-wide condemnation of sectarian rule, [139] a stagnant economy and liquidity crisis, unemployment, endemic corruption in the public sector, [139] legislation (such as banking secrecy) that is perceived to shield the ruling class from accountability [140] [141] and failures from the government to provide basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation [142]\n\n\nGeography\nLebanon is located in West Asia between latitudes 33° and 35° N and longitudes 35° and 37° E Its land straddles the \"northwest of the Arabian Plate\" [177] The country's surface area is 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi) of which 10,230 square kilometres (3,950 sq mi) is land Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometres (140 mi) on the Mediterranean Sea to the west, a 375 kilometres (233 mi) border shared with Syria to the north and east and a 79 kilometres (49 mi) long border with Israel to the south [178] The border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called Shebaa Farms [179]\n\n\nClimate\nLebanon has a moderate Mediterranean climate In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops [178] [181] Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall, when measured annually in comparison to its arid surroundings, certain areas in north-eastern Lebanon receives only little because of the rain shadow created by the high peaks of the western mountain range [182]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn ancient times, Lebanon was covered by large forests of cedar trees, the national emblem of the country [183] Millennia of deforestation have altered the hydrology in Mount Lebanon and changed the regional climate adversely [184] As of 2012, forests covered 13.4% of the Lebanese land area; [185] they are under constant threat from wildfires caused by the long dry summer season [186]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy that includes confessionalism [205] The National Pact, erected in 1943, laid out a governing arrangement intended to harmonize the interests of the country's major religious groups [206] The President has to be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi’a Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Eastern Orthodox [207] [208] This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and to represent fairly the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government [209] [210]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nLebanon is divided into nine governorates (muḥāfaẓāt, Arabic: محافظات; singular muḥāfaẓah, Arabic: محافظة) which are further subdivided into twenty-five districts (aqdyah, Arabic: أقضية; singular: qadāʾ Arabic: قضاء) [222] The districts themselves are also divided into several municipalities, each enclosing a group of cities or villages The governorates and their respective districts are listed below:\n\n\nForeign relations\nLebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001, and both sides initialed the accord in January 2002 It is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the World Trade Organization.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has 72,000 active personnel, [223] including 1,100 in the air force, and 1,000 in the navy [224] The LAF is considered less powerful and influential than Hezbollah in Lebanon Hezbollah has 20,000 active fighters and 20,000 in reserves and is supplied with advanced weaponry, including rockets and drones from Iran [225] [226]\n\n\nLaw\nThere are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts [230] The Lebanese legal system is based on the French system, and is a civil law country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the Sharia law [231] \nFor Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody Catholics can additionally appeal before the Vatican Rota court [232]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nMale homosexuality is illegal in Lebanon [235] Discrimination against LGBT people in Lebanon is widespread [236] [237] According to 2019 survey by the Pew Research Center, 85% of Lebanese respondents believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society [238]\n\n\nEconomy\nLebanon's constitution states that 'the economic system is free and ensures private initiative and the right to private property' Lebanon's economy follows a laissez-faire model [240] Most of the economy is dollarized, and the country has no restrictions on the movement of capital across its borders [240] The Lebanese government's intervention in foreign trade is minimal [240] The Investment Development Authority of Lebanon was established with the aim of promoting investment in Lebanon In 2001, Investment Law No.360 [241] was enacted to reinforce the organisation's mission.\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe agricultural sector in Lebanon employs 20–25% of the total workforce, [253] and contributed 3.1% to the country's GDP, [254] as of 2020 Lebanon has the highest proportion of cultivable land in the Arab world [255] Major crops include apples, peaches, oranges, and lemons [14] A significant portion of the country's factories, approximately one-third, is dedicated to producing packaged food items, ranging from poultry to pickles [253] However, despite favorable conditions for farming and diverse microclimates, the country depends on food imports, constituting 80% of its consumption This is mainly attributed to the small scale of many farms, preventing the benefits of economies of scale [253] The ongoing economic crisis and devaluation of the Lebanese pound have also negatively impacted the agricultural sector, particularly through elevated costs for essential imports such as seeds and fertilizers This economic strain compounds existing burdens for farmers, including escalating debts and inefficient agricultural practices Consequently, farmers are observing a decline in revenues and encountering difficulties in meeting loan repayment obligations [253] [256]\n\n\nManufacturing and industry\nIndustry in Lebanon is mainly limited to small businesses that reassemble and package imported parts In 2004, industry ranked second in workforce, with 26% of the Lebanese working population, [246] and second in GDP contribution, with 21% of Lebanon's GDP [14]\n\n\nScience and technology\nLebanon was ranked 94th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, down from 88th in 2019 [263] [264] [265] Notable scientists from Lebanon include Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah, Rammal Rammal, and Edgar Choueiri [266] [267]\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn the 1950s, GDP growth was the second highest in the world Despite having no oil reserves, Lebanon, as the Arab world's banking center [270] and among its trading center, had a high national income [271]\n\nTourism\nThe tourism industry accounts for about 10% of GDP [280] Lebanon attracted around 1,333,000 tourists in 2008, thus placing it as 79th out of 191 countries [281] In 2009, The New York Times ranked Beirut the No. 1 travel destination worldwide due to its nightlife and hospitality [282] In January 2010, the Ministry of Tourism announced that 1,851,081 tourists had visited Lebanon in 2009, a 39% increase from 2008 [283] In 2009, Lebanon hosted the largest number of tourists to date, eclipsing the previous record set before the Lebanese Civil War [284] Tourist arrivals reached two million in 2010, but fell by 37% for the first 10 months of 2012, a decline caused by the war in neighbouring Syria [280]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Lebanon was estimated to be 5,592,631 in 2021, with the number of Lebanese nationals estimated to be 4,680,212 (July 2018 est.); [287] [288] however, no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive confessional political balance between Lebanon's various religious groups [289] Identifying all Lebanese as ethnically Arab is a widely employed example of panethnicity, as the Lebanese \"are descended from many different peoples who are either indigenous, or have occupied, invaded, or settled this corner of the world\", making Lebanon, \"a mosaic of closely interrelated cultures\" [c] [292]\n\n\nReligion\nLebanon is the most religiously diverse country in West Asia and the Mediterranean [311] Because the relative sizes of different religions and religious sects remains a sensitive issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932 [312] There are 18 state-recognized religious sects – four Muslim, 12 Christian, one Druze, and one Jewish [312] The Lebanese government counts its Druze citizens as part of its Muslim population, [313] although most Druze today do not identify as Muslims [314] [315]\n\n\nLanguage\nArticle 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that \"Arabic is the official national language A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used\" [1] The majority of Lebanese people speak Lebanese Arabic, which is grouped in a larger category called Levantine Arabic, while Modern Standard Arabic is mostly used in magazines, newspapers, and formal broadcast media Lebanese Sign Language is the language of the Deaf community.\n\n\nEducation\nAccording to surveys from the World Economic Forum's 2013 Global Information Technology Report, Lebanon has been ranked globally as the fourth best country for math and science education, and as the tenth best overall for quality of education In quality of management schools, the country was ranked 13th worldwide [333]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 7.03% of the country's GDP In 2009, there were 31.29 physicians and 19.71 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants [347] The life expectancy at birth was 72.59 years in 2011, or 70.48 years for males and 74.80 years for females [348] By the end of the civil war, only one-third of the country's public hospitals were operational, each with an average of 20 beds By 2009, the country had 28 public hospitals, with a total of 2,550 beds [349] At public hospitals, hospitalized uninsured patients pay 5% of the bill, in comparison with 15% in private hospitals, with the Ministry of Public Health reimbursing the remainder [349] The Ministry of Public Health contracts with 138 private hospitals and 25 public hospitals [350]\n\n\nMental health\nThe Asfouriyeh Hospital, founded in 1896 in Lebanon, is considered the first modern mental health hospital in the Middle East The devastating impact of the Lebanese Civil War led to the hospital's closure in 1982 [353]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Lebanon reflects the legacy of various civilizations spanning thousands of years Originally home to the Canaanite-Phoenicians, and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the Assyrians, the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs, the Crusaders, the Ottoman Turks and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they \"share an almost common culture\" [354] Lebanese Arabic is universally spoken while food, music, and literature are deep-rooted \"in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms\" [354]\n\n\nArts\nIn visual arts, Moustafa Farroukh was among Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 20th century Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career [355] Many more contemporary artists are active, such as Walid Raad, a contemporary media artist residing in New York [356] In the field of photography, the Arab Image Foundation has a collection of over 400,000 photographs from Lebanon and the Middle East The photographs can be viewed in a research center and various events and publications have been produced in Lebanon and worldwide to promote the collection.\n\n\nLiterature\nIn literature, Kahlil Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi [357] He is particularly known for his book The Prophet (1923), which has been translated into over twenty different languages [358] Ameen Rihani was a major figure in the mahjar literary movement developed by Arab emigrants in North America, and an early theorist of Arab nationalism Mikhail Naimy is widely recognized as among the most important figures in modern Arabic letters and among the most important spiritual writers of the 20th century Several contemporary Lebanese writers have also achieved international success; including Elias Khoury, Amin Maalouf, Hanan al-Shaykh, and Georges Schéhadé.\n\n\nMusic\nWhile traditional folk music remains popular in Lebanon, modern music reconciling Western and traditional Arabic styles, pop, and fusion are rapidly advancing in popularity [359] Lebanese artists like Fairuz, Majida El Roumi, Wadih El Safi, Sabah, Julia Boutros or Najwa Karam are widely known and appreciated in Lebanon and in the Arab world Radio stations feature a variety of music, including traditional Lebanese, classical Arabic, Armenian [360] and modern French, English, American, and Latin tunes [361]\n\n\nMedia and cinema\nThe cinema of Lebanon, according to film critic and historian, Roy Armes, was the only cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, besides the dominant Egyptian cinema, [362] [363] that could amount to a national cinema [364] Cinema in Lebanon has been in existence since the 1920s, and the country has produced over 500 films with many films including Egyptian filmmakers and film stars [365] The media of Lebanon is not only a regional center of production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world [366] According to Press freedom's Reporters Without Borders, \"the media have more freedom in Lebanon than in any other Arab country\" [367] Despite its small population and geographic size, Lebanon plays an influential role in the production of information in the Arab world and is \"at the core of a regional media network with global implications\" [368]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nLebanon celebrates national and both Christian and Muslim holidays Christian holidays are celebrated following both the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar Greek Orthodox (with the exception of Easter), Catholics, Protestants, and Melkite Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December Armenian Apostolic Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning) Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture [369] Among the most famous are Baalbeck International Festival, Byblos International Festival, Beiteddine International Festival, Jounieh International Festival, Broumana Festival, Batroun International Festival, Ehmej Festival, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival [369] [370] These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's Ministry of Tourism Lebanon hosts about 15 concerts from international performers each year, ranking 1st for nightlife in the Middle East, and 6th worldwide [371]\n\n\nCuisine\nLebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus The Lebanese national dishes are the kibbe, a meat pie made from finely minced lamb and burghul (cracked wheat), and the tabbouleh, a salad made from parsley, tomatoes, and burghul wheat  Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of mezze – small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled meat or fish In general, meals are finished with Arabic coffee and fresh fruit, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.\n\n\nSports\nLebanon has six ski resorts Because of Lebanon's unique geography, it is possible to go skiing in the morning and swimming in the Mediterranean Sea in the afternoon [372] At the competitive level, basketball and football are among Lebanon's most popular sports Canoeing, cycling, rafting, climbing, swimming, sailing and caving are among the other common leisure sports in Lebanon The Beirut Marathon is held every fall, drawing top runners from Lebanon and abroad [373]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n\nGeneral

choosing Molina as his first defense, Wilder claimed there were other options, but their asking prices were too high [53] Molina was aiming to become the first Mexican-American world heavyweight champion in history A sold-out crowd of 9,347 was announced Wilder dominated, knocking down Molina near the end of round four, twice in the fifth, and knocking him out onto his back in the ninth round

This article highlights some of the most notable families that have achieved success in the Olympics.\n\n**Summer Olympics**\n\nMany families have made a name for themselves in the Summer Olympics, with multiple members winning medals in various sports.\n\n### Wife\n\nOne notable example is the family of Renée Pot, a Dutch sprinter who won a bronze medal in the 4x100 meters relay at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Her husband, Hans Leek, was a Dutch sprinter who competed in the 1960 and 1964 Summer Olympics, but did not win a medal. Their daughter, Jolanda Leek, went on to become a successful sprinter in her own right, winning a silver medal in the 4x100 meters relay at the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n### Parent-Child\n\nThe family of Bob and Judy Tyszkiewicz is another example of a family that has made a significant impact in the Summer Olympics. Bob Tyszkiewicz is a Canadian rower who won a bronze medal in the coxed pairs at the 1956 Summer Olympics, while his daughter, Judy Tyszkiewicz, won a bronze medal in the coxed eights at the 1960 Summer Olympics.\n\n### Siblings\n\nThe family of the Finnish brothers, Matti, Martti, and Eero Tapio, is a notable example of sibling success in the Summer Olympics.

The film is a sequel to Leone's 2018 film Terrifier, and it stars David Howard Thornton as the main antagonist, Art the Clown.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place after the events of the first film, where Art the Clown is resurrected by an unknown entity. The story follows Art as he brutally murders the coroner examining his body and then goes to a laundromat to clean his blood-soaked garments. There, he encounters the Little Pale Girl, a mysterious entity in similar clown attire. A lone patron sees Art interacting with the girl, who is invisible to him, before being killed.\n\nThe film then shifts its focus to the main character, Sienna Shaw, played by Lauren LaVera, who is a young woman trying to navigate her life with her friends. As Art begins to terrorize the town, Sienna and her friends become his targets. The film's plot is a mix of horror and dark comedy, with a focus on Art's brutal killings and the reactions of the characters around him.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe cast of Terrifier 2 includes David Howard Thornton as Art the Clown, Lauren LaVera as Sienna Shaw, and Casey Hartnett as Ally, a supporting character who becomes a victim of Art's. The film also features Jenna Kanell and Catherine Corcoran in photographic cameos as Tara and Dawn, respectively.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Terrifier 2 was a collaborative effort between Leone and his team. Leone had secured full funding for the film from a handful of private investors prior to filming, but he also launched an Indiegogo campaign to finance a practical effects-driven scene and to attach a well-known actor to the project. The campaign was a major success, grossing over $125,000 in the first week and reaching a total of $250,000 by the end of the campaign, 430% more than the initial goal.\n\nThe film's special effects were a major focus for Leone, who wanted to create a more realistic and intense experience for the audience. The film's notorious \"Bedroom Scene\" depicts the lengthy murder of the supporting character Ally, and it was the most challenging and technical scene to film out of the entire production. Leone had to create a life-size replica puppet of Hartnett that could work as an animatronic, and he used a combination of practical and digital effects to create the scene.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Terrifier 2 was focused on building anticipation and hype for the film's release. A teaser trailer for the film was released in July 2020, and it generated a lot of buzz and excitement among horror fans. The trailer showcased the film's intense and gory moments, and it gave a glimpse into the film's plot and characters.\n\n**Special Effects**\n\nThe film's special effects were a major focus for Leone, who wanted to create a more realistic and intense experience for the audience.

The film was theatrically released on October 6, 2022, and it was later available to stream on Screambox. Leone had previously expressed a desire to release the picture \"road show style\" once finished, but he ultimately decided to go with a traditional theatrical release.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received a mixed response from critics, with some praising its intense and gory moments, while others found it to be too excessive and gratuitous. The film's Rotten Tomatoes score is 86%, based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Terrifier 2 outdoes the original in every way – which makes it bad news for the squeamish, but a bloody good time for genre enthusiasts.\"\n\n**Audience Response**\n\nThe film's audience response was intense, with several reports of viewers vomiting and fainting during their screenings. Leone has spoken about the reactions, saying: \"Listen, I would have loved to have a couple of walk-outs, I think that's sort of a badge of honor because it is an intense movie. I don't want people fainting, getting hurt during the movie. But it's surreal.\"\n\n**Accolades**\n\nA novelization of Terrifier 2 was released by Titans Books on October 29, 2024. The novelization was written by Tim Waggoner, who is a well-known horror author. The novelization explores the film's plot and characters in more depth, and it provides a fresh perspective on the film's themes and motifs.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nIn 2019, Leone and Thornton stated that a Terrifier 3 is planned, along with further installments that will slowly build on Art's background and motives. In October 2022, Leone said he had an entire treatment for a third film but it \"is getting so big that it could potentially split into a Part 4 because I wouldn't want to make another 2 hour 20

{"title": "Cloud_computing", "content": "\nDefinition\nA European Commission communication issued in 2012 argued that the breadth of scope offered by cloud computing made a general definition \"elusive\", [5] whereas the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's 2011 definition of cloud computing identified \"five essential characteristics\":\n\n\nHistory\nThe history of cloud computing extends back to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE) The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users [7]\n\n\nValue proposition\nAdvocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, [14] [15] [16] providing burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand [17]\n\n\nChallenges and limitations\nOne of the main challenges of cloud computing, in comparison to more traditional on-premises computing, is data security and privacy Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection, such as GDPR or HIPAA [35]\n\n\nImplementation challenges\nApplications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing, a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment  [39]\n\n\nCloud cost overruns\nIn a report by Gartner, a survey of 200 IT leaders revealed that 69% experienced budget overruns in their organizations' cloud expenditures during 2023 Conversely, 31% of IT leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting, proactive monitoring of spending, and effective optimization  [40]\n\n\nService Level Agreements\nTypically, cloud providers' Service Level Agreements (SLAs) do not encompass all forms of service interruptions Exclusions typically include planned maintenance, downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues, human errors, like misconfigurations, natural disasters, force majeure events, or security breaches Typically, customers bear the responsibility of monitoring SLA compliance and must file claims for any unmet SLAs within a designated timeframe Customers should be aware of how deviations from SLAs are calculated, as these parameters may vary by service These requirements can place a considerable burden on customers Additionally, SLA percentages and conditions can differ across various services within the same provider, with some services lacking any SLA altogether In cases of service interruptions due to hardware failures in the cloud provider, the company typically does not offer monetary compensation Instead, eligible users may receive credits as outlined in the corresponding SLA  [41] [42] [43] [44]\n\n\nSecurity and privacy\nCloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time  It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information [45] Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for how data is stored [45] Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access [45] Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity [46] The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.\n\n\nService models\nThe service-oriented architecture (SOA) promotes the idea of \"Everything as a Service\" (EaaS or XaaS, or simply aAsS) [52] This concept is operationalized in cloud computing through several service models as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) The three standard service models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) [6] They are commonly depicted as layers in a stack, providing different levels of abstraction However, these layers are not necessarily interdependent For instance, SaaS can be delivered on bare metal, bypassing PaaS and IaaS, and a program can run directly on IaaS without being packaged as SaaS.\n\n\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS)\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers The use of containers offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles [53]\n\n\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as: [6]\n\n\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as: [6]\n\n\n\"Backend\" as a service (BaaS)\nIn the \"backend\" as a service (m) model, also known as \"mobile backend as a service\" (MBaaS), web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom software development kits (SDKs) Services include user management, push notifications, integration with social networking services [66] and more This is a relatively recent model in cloud computing, [67] with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later [68] [69] [70] but trends indicate that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers [71]\n\n\nServerless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)\nServerless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests Requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine per hour [72] Despite the name, serverless computing does not actually involve running code without servers [72] The business or person using the system does not have to purchase, rent, provide or provision servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.\n\n\nDeployment models\nThe deployment of services to the cloud is referred to as cloud migration \n\n\nPrivate\nPrivate cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally [6] Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities Self-run data centers [77] are generally capital intensive They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures They have attracted criticism because users \"still have to buy, build, and manage them\" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management, [78] essentially \" [lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept\" [79] [80]\n\n\nPublic\nCloud services are considered \"public\" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge [81] Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications [19] [82]\n\n\nHybrid\nHybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources, [84] [85] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources [6] Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers [86] A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.\n\n\nOthers\nCommunity cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether it is managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted internally or externally, the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud (but more than a private cloud) As a result, only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved.\n [6]\n\n\nCommunity\nCommunity cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether it is managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted internally or externally, the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud (but more than a private cloud) As a result, only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved.\n [6]\n\n\nDistributed\nA cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub service It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.\n\n\nMulti\nMulticloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy) [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nPoly\nPoly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers It differs from Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more than could be done with a single provider [96]\n\n\nBig data\nThe issues of transferring large amounts of data to the cloud as well as data security once the data is in the cloud initially hampered adoption of cloud for big data, but now that much data originates in the cloud and with the advent of bare-metal servers, the cloud has become [97] a solution for use cases including business analytics and geospatial analysis [98]\n\n\nHPC\nHPC cloud refers to the use of cloud computing services and infrastructure to execute high-performance computing (HPC) applications [99] These applications consume a considerable amount of computing power and memory and are traditionally executed on clusters of computers In 2016 a handful of companies, including R-HPC, Amazon Web Services, Univa, Silicon Graphics International, Sabalcore, Gomput, and Penguin Computing offered a high-performance computing cloud The Penguin On Demand (POD) cloud was one of the first non-virtualized remote HPC services offered on a pay-as-you-go basis [100] [101] Penguin Computing launched its HPC cloud in 2016 as an alternative to Amazon's EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud, which uses virtualized computing nodes [102] [103]\n\n\nArchitecture\nCloud architecture, [104] the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others.\n\n\nCloud engineering\nCloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines of cloud computing It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems, software, web, performance, information technology engineering, security, platform, risk, and quality engineering.\n\n\nMarket\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on cloud computing services has reached $706 billion and is expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025 [105] Gartner estimated that global public cloud services end-user spending would reach $600 billion by 2023 [106] According to a McKinsey & Company report, cloud cost-optimization levers and value-oriented business use cases foresee more than $1 trillion in run-rate EBITDA across Fortune 500 companies as up for grabs in 2030 [107] In 2022, more than $1.3 trillion in enterprise IT spending was at stake from the shift to the cloud, growing to almost $1.8 trillion in 2025,

"lang": "en", "article": "Cloud Computing\n\nCloud computing is a model of delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, databases, software, and applications are provided as a service to users on-demand. This approach allows users to access a shared pool of computing resources, rather than having to manage and maintain their own infrastructure.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe definition of cloud computing is somewhat elusive, as it encompasses a broad range of services and technologies. However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of cloud computing has its roots in the 1960s, when the initial ideas of time-sharing became popularized via remote job entry (RJE). The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end-users.\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nAdvocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.\n\n**Challenges and Limitations**\n\nOne of the main challenges of cloud computing, in comparison to more traditional on-premises computing, is data security and privacy. Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks. Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection, such as GDPR or HIPAA.\n\n**Implementation Challenges**\n\nApplications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing, a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment.\n\n**Cloud Cost Overruns**\n\nIn a report by Gartner, a survey of 200 IT leaders revealed that 69% experienced budget overruns in their organizations' cloud expenditures during 2023. Conversely, 31% of IT leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting, proactive monitoring of spending, and effective optimization.\n\n**Service Level Agreements**\n\nTypically, cloud providers' Service Level Agreements (SLAs) do not encompass all forms of service interruptions. Exclusions typically include planned maintenance, downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues, human errors, like misconfigurations, natural disasters, force majeure events, or security breaches. Customers bear the responsibility of monitoring SLA compliance and must file claims for any unmet SLAs within a designated timeframe.\n\n**Security and Privacy**\n\nCloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information. Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant. Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**Service Models**\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines three standard service models for cloud computing: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).\n\n**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**\n\nIaaS refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure. This includes virtual machines, storage, networks, and firewalls.\n\n**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**\n\nPaaS refers to complete development and deployment environments in the cloud, which are managed by the provider. This includes tools for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications.\n\n**Software as a Service (SaaS)**\n\nSaaS refers to software applications delivered over the internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software on individual computers, users can access the same software application over the internet.\n\n**Deployment Models**\n\nCloud computing can be deployed in three main models: public, private, and hybrid.\n\n**Public Cloud**\n\nPublic cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally.\n\n**Private Cloud**\n\nPrivate cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally.\n\n**Hybrid Cloud**\n\nHybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources, that remain distinct entities but are bound together.\n\n**Others**\n\nOther deployment models include community cloud, distributed cloud, multicloud, poly cloud, big data cloud, and HPC cloud.\n\n**Cloud Engineering**\n\nCloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines of cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems.\n\n**Market**\n\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on cloud computing services has reached $706 billion and is expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025. Gartner estimated that global public cloud services end-user spending would reach $600 billion by 2023.\n\n**Similar Concepts**\n\nThe goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cloud_computing\" following this outline:\n\n\nDefinition\nA European Commission communication issued in 2012 argued that the breadth of scope offered by cloud computing made a general definition \"elusive\", [5] whereas the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's 2011 definition of cloud computing identified \"five essential characteristics\":\n\n\nHistory\nThe history of cloud computing extends back to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE) The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the

avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, [14] [15] [16] providing burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand [17]\n\n\nChallenges and limitations\nOne of the main challenges of cloud computing, in comparison to more traditional on-premises computing, is data security and privacy Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks Cloud users also face compliance risks if they have to adhere to certain regulations or standards regarding data protection, such as GDPR or HIPAA [35]\n\n\nImplementation challenges\nApplications hosted in the cloud are susceptible to the fallacies of distributed computing, a series of misconceptions that can lead to significant issues in software development and deployment  [39]\n\n\nCloud cost overruns\nIn a report by Gartner, a survey of 200 IT leaders revealed that 69% experienced budget overruns in their organizations' cloud expenditures during 2023 Conversely, 31% of IT leaders whose organizations stayed within budget attributed their success to accurate forecasting and budgeting, proactive monitoring of spending, and effective optimization  [40]\n\n\nService Level Agreements\nTypically, cloud providers' Service Level Agreements (SLAs) do not encompass all forms of service interruptions Exclusions typically include planned maintenance, downtime resulting from external factors such as network issues, human errors, like misconfigurations, natural disasters, force majeure events, or security breaches Typically, customers bear the responsibility of monitoring SLA compliance and must file claims for any unmet SLAs within a designated timeframe Customers should be aware of how deviations from SLAs are calculated, as these parameters may vary by service These requirements can place a considerable burden on customers Additionally, SLA percentages and conditions can differ across various services within the same provider, with some services lacking any SLA altogether In cases of service interruptions due to hardware failures in the cloud provider, the company typically does not offer monetary compensation Instead, eligible users may receive credits as outlined in the corresponding SLA  [41] [42] [43] [44]\n\n\nSecurity and privacy\nCloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time  It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information [45] Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end-users' choices for how data is stored [45] Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access [45] Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing These systems distinguish between authorized and unauthorized users and determine the amount of data that is accessible to each entity [46] The systems work by creating and describing identities, recording activities, and getting rid of unused identities.\n\n\nService models\nThe service-oriented architecture (SOA) promotes the idea of \"Everything as a Service\" (EaaS or XaaS, or simply aAsS) [52] This concept is operationalized in cloud computing through several service models as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) The three standard service models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) [6] They are commonly depicted as layers in a stack, providing different levels of abstraction However, these layers are not necessarily interdependent For instance, SaaS can be delivered on bare metal, bypassing PaaS and IaaS, and a program can run directly on IaaS without being packaged as SaaS.\n\n\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS)\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc A hypervisor runs the virtual machines as guests Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers The use of containers offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles [53]\n\n\nPlatform as a service (PaaS)\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as: [6]\n\n\nSoftware as a service (SaaS)\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as: [6]\n\n\n\"Backend\" as a service (BaaS)\nIn the \"backend\" as a service (m) model, also known as \"mobile backend as a service\" (MBaaS), web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom software development kits (SDKs) Services include user management, push notifications, integration with social networking services [66] and more This is a relatively recent model in cloud computing, [67] with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later [68] [69] [70] but trends indicate that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers [71]\n\n\nServerless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)\nServerless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests Requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine per hour [72] Despite the name, serverless computing does not actually involve running code without servers [72] The business or person using the system does not have to purchase, rent, provide or provision servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.\n\n\nDeployment models\nThe deployment of services to the cloud is referred to as cloud migration \n\n\nPrivate\nPrivate cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally [6] Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities Self-run data centers [77] are generally capital intensive They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures They have attracted criticism because users \"still have to buy, build, and manage them\" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management, [78] essentially \" [lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept\" [79] [80]\n\n\nPublic\nCloud services are considered \"public\" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge [81] Architecturally, there are few differences between public- and private-cloud services, but security concerns increase substantially when services (applications, storage, and other resources) are shared by multiple customers Most public-cloud providers offer direct-connection services that allow customers to securely link their legacy data centers to their cloud-resident applications [19] [82]\n\n\nHybrid\nHybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources, [84] [85] that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources [6] Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers [86] A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cannot be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.\n\n\nOthers\nCommunity cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether it is managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted internally or externally, the costs are distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud (but more than a private cloud) As a result, only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved.\n [6]\n\n\nCommunity\nCommunity cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from

distributed among fewer users compared to a public cloud (but more than a private cloud) As a result, only a portion of the potential cost savings of cloud computing is achieved.\n [6]\n\n\nDistributed\nA cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub service It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.\n\n\nMulti\nMulticloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy) [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nPoly\nPoly cloud refers to the use of multiple public clouds for the purpose of leveraging specific services that each provider offers It differs from Multi cloud in that it is not designed to increase flexibility or mitigate against failures but is rather used to allow an organization to achieve more than could be done with a single provider [96]\n\n\nBig data\nThe issues of transferring large amounts of data to the cloud as well as data security once the data is in the cloud initially hampered adoption of cloud for big data, but now that much data originates in the cloud and with the advent of bare-metal servers, the cloud has become [97] a solution for use cases including business analytics and geospatial analysis [98]\n\n\nHPC\nHPC cloud refers to the use of cloud computing services and infrastructure to execute high-performance computing (HPC) applications [99] These applications consume a considerable amount of computing power and memory and are traditionally executed on clusters of computers In 2016 a handful of companies, including R-HPC, Amazon Web Services, Univa, Silicon Graphics International, Sabalcore, Gomput, and Penguin Computing offered a high-performance computing cloud The Penguin On Demand (POD) cloud was one of the first non-virtualized remote HPC services offered on a pay-as-you-go basis [100] [101] Penguin Computing launched its HPC cloud in 2016 as an alternative to Amazon's EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud, which uses virtualized computing nodes [102] [103]\n\n\nArchitecture\nCloud architecture, [104] the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others.\n\n\nCloud engineering\nCloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines of cloud computing It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems, software, web, performance, information technology engineering, security, platform, risk, and quality engineering.\n\n\nMarket\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on cloud computing services has reached $706 billion and is expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025 [105] Gartner estimated that global public cloud services end-user spending would reach $600 billion by 2023 [106] According to a McKinsey & Company report, cloud cost-optimization levers and value-oriented business use cases foresee more than $1 trillion in run-rate EBITDA across Fortune 500 companies as up for grabs in 2030 [107] In 2022, more than $1.3 trillion in enterprise IT spending was at stake from the shift to the cloud, growing to almost $1.8 trillion in 2025, according to Gartner [108]\n\n\nList of public clouds\nThe goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them The cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles [109] The main enabling technology for cloud

{"title": "Coronavirus_disease_2019", "content": "\nNomenclature\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", [28] [29] [30] with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\" [31] [32] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, [33] Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus [34] In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV [35] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [36] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma [37] [38] [39] The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\" [40] [41] The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications [40] [42]\n\n\nSymptoms and signs\n\n\n\nComplications\nComplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death [66] [67] [68] [69] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] and endothelial cell injury and dysfunction [76] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury [77] [78]\n\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) [87]\n\n\nTransmission\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing [88] [89] [90] [91] Transmission is more likely the closer people are However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors [88] [92]\n\n\nVirology\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan [103] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature, [104] particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats) [105]\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages [113] [114] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences\" [115] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR) [116] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage [114] [117]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs) [127] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs [128] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell [129]\n\n\nRespiratory tract\nFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways [130]  Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung [131]\n\n\nNervous system\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons [134] The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications [135] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed [136] While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain [137] [138] [139] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell [136]\n\n\nGastrointestinal tract\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium [145] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine [146]\n\n\nCardiovascular system\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system [147] [148] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, [149] and is more frequent in severe disease [150] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart [148] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function [148] [151]\n\n\nKidneys\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys [153] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems [158]\n\n\nImmunopathology\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑6, IL‑7, as well as the following suggest an underlying immunopathology: [149]\n\n\nViral and host factors\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n\nVirus proteins\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n\nHost factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID‑19 Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain [166]\n\n\nHost cytokine response\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm [170] Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease [171]\n\n\nPregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures [173]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions [27] [176] Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection [177] Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection [27]\n\n\nViral testing\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, [27] [178] which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments [179] As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited\" [180] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used [181] [182] Results are generally available within hours [27] The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease [183]\n\n\nImaging\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening [177] [189] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection [177] [190] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses [177] [191] Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions [192]\n\n\nCoding\nIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [194]\n\n\nPathology\nThe main pathological findings at autopsy are:\n\n\nPrevention\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, [200] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands [201] [202]\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\n\nFace masks and respiratory hygiene\n\n\n\nIndoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces\nThe CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection [240] When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission [240] [241] The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols [242] [243] [244]\n\n\nHand-washing and hygiene\nThorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required [246] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose [247] When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol [248] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis\" Glycerol is added as a humectant [249]\n\n\nSocial distancing\nSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others [250]\n\n\nSurface cleaning\nAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection [253] Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, [254] [255] [256] leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes [257] [258] Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air [259] [260]\n\n\nSelf-isolation\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation [267] Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups [268] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure [269]\n\n\nInternational travel-related control measures\nA 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19 [270] Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases [270] While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening [270]\n\n\nTreatment\n\nThe treatment and management of COVID-19 combines both supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support as needed, [271] [272] [273] and a growing list of approved medications Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important [274]  Some people may experience persistent symptoms or disability after recovery from the infection, known as long COVID, but there is still limited information on the best management and rehabilitation for this condition [275]\n\n\nPrognosis and risk factors\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation [299] Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [109] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death [300] Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support [301] [302] Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU [303] [304]\n\n\nGenetic risk factors\nGenetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid [325] For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19 [326] [327] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes [328] Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations For instance, an allele of the DOCK2 gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK2 especially in younger patients with severe Covid [329] In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections [330]\n\n\nChildren\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole [331] [332] Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults [333] The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU, [334] while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care [335] Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study [336] [337]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAround 10% to 30% of non-hospitalised people with COVID-19 go on to develop long COVID For those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence of long-term effects is over 50% [21] Long COVID is an often severe multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms There are likely various, possibly coinciding, causes [21] Organ damage from the acute infection can explain a part of the symptoms, but long COVID is also observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent [338]\n\n\nImmunity\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, [344] just as with most other infections [345] B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen [346] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease [347] The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms [347]\n\n\nMortality\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality [350] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health [351]\n\n\nCase fatality rate\nThe case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023 [356] The number varies by region [357] [351]\n\n\nInfection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk [360] [361] [362] This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases [363]\n\n\nEstimates\nA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy [364] That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85 [364] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO [365]\n\n\nEarlier estimates of IFR\nAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1% [366] [367] On 2 July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6% [368] [369] In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1% [370] Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected) [371] As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population) [372] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈0.9%, [373] and ≈1.4% [374] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died [375] In September 2020, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes [376]\n\n\nSex differences\nCOVID‑19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men [355] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die [378] [379] One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58) [380]\n\n\nEthnic differences\nIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups [388] Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, [389] hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death [390] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities [388] On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent [391] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults [392] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water [392]\n\n\nComorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19 [355] Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, [389] and cardiovascular disease [398] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions [399] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases [300] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischaemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).\n\n\nHistory\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection [104] [405] [406] A joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization indicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host [407] There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing [408] According to articles published in July 2022 in Science, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the Huanan wet market in the city of Wuhan (Hubei, China) [409] [410] [411] Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover [412] Earlier phylogenetics estimated that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019 [413] [414] [415] A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan [416]\n\n\nMisinformation\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online [466] [467] [468]\n\n\nOther species\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, [470] [471] a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis [472] [473]\n\n\nResearch\nInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers [478] [479] The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory [480] There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand [481]\n\n\nTransmission and prevention research\nModelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, [484] diagnosis and prognosis of infection, [485] estimation of the impact of interventions, [486] [487] or allocation of resources [488] Modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology, [489] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID‑19, [490] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, [491] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, [492] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic [493]\n\n\nTreatment-related research\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments [494] [495] Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [495]\n\n\nCytokine storm\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19 A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure [515] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm [516]\n\n\nPassive antibodies\nTransferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation [525] [526] Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2 The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies [527] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies [528] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections [527] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible [525] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development [525]\n\n\nBioethics\nSince the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis [529] Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, [530] and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies [531] [532] The socio-economic inequalities between genders, [533] races, [534] groups with disabilities, [535] communities, [536] regions, countries, [537] and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public [538] [539]\n\n\nSee

Disease 2019**\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has since spread globally, affecting millions of people and causing widespread illness and death.\n\n**Nomenclature**\n\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease, respectively. The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020, with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\".\n\n**Symptoms and Signs**\n\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe and include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and loss of appetite. In severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart inflammation, are also common.\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications of COVID-19 can include pneumonia, ARDS, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart inflammation, are also common. Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.\n\n**Cause**\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing. Transmission is more likely the closer people are, but infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.\n\n**Virology**\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature, particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats).\n\n**SARS-CoV-2 Variants**\n\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions, and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain, and Pango.\n\n**Pathophysiology**\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. COVID-19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs.\n\n**Respiratory Tract**\n\nFollowing viral entry, COVID-19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.\n\n**Nervous System**\n\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons. The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID-19 has been reported in many medical publications.\n\n**Gastrointestinal Tract**\n\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelium, as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.\n\n**Cardiovascular System**\n\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China.\n\n**Kidneys**\n\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys. Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.\n\n**Immunopathology**\n\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, as well as others, suggest an underlying immunopathology.\n\n**Viral and Host Factors**\n\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors. It includes two subunits: S1 and S2. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID-19.\n\n**Immunity**\n\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, just as with most other infections. B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality. The case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. The infection fatality rate (IFR) incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.\n\n**Sex Differences**\n\nCOVID-19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries. Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die.\n\n**Ethnic Differences**\n\nIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups.\n\n**Comorbidities**\n\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behavior (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID-19. Most of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n**History**\n\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection.

the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", [28] [29] [30] with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\" [31] [32] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, [33] Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus [34] In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV [35] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease [36] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma [37] [38] [39] The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 with COVID-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\" [40] [41] The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications [40] [42]\n\n\nSymptoms and signs\n\n\n\nComplications\nComplications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death [66] [67] [68] [69] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] and endothelial cell injury and dysfunction [76] Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID‑19 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury [77] [78]\n\n\nCause\nCOVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) [87]\n\n\nTransmission\n\nCOVID-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus Infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing [88] [89] [90] [91] Transmission is more likely the closer people are However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors [88] [92]\n\n\nVirology\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan [103] All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature, [104] particularly in Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats) [105]\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants\nThe many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages [113] [114] The WHO, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages by GISAID, Nextstrain and Pango The expert group convened by the WHO recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the Greek alphabet, for example, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences\" [115] Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR) [116] The Pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the B.1 lineage [114] [117]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body COVID‑19 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs) [127] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs [128] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell [129]\n\n\nRespiratory tract\nFollowing viral entry, COVID‑19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways [130]  Autopsies of people who died of COVID‑19 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung [131]\n\n\nNervous system\nOne common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons [134] The involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in COVID‑19 has been reported in many medical publications [135] It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues The virus is not detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed [136] While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain [137] [138] [139] The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood–brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell [136]\n\n\nGastrointestinal tract\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium [145] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine [146]\n\n\nCardiovascular system\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system [147] [148] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, [149] and is more frequent in severe disease [150] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart [148] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function [148] [151]\n\n\nKidneys\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys [153] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems [158]\n\n\nImmunopathology\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe COVID‑19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL‑2, IL‑6, IL‑7, as well as the following suggest an underlying immunopathology: [149]\n\n\nViral and host factors\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n\nVirus proteins\nMultiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus The S-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ACE2 receptors It includes two subunits: S1 and S2.\n\n\nHost factors\nHuman angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the host factor that SARS-CoV-2 virus targets causing COVID‑19 Theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and ACE inhibitors upregulating ACE2 expression might increase morbidity with COVID‑19, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of ARB; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes Until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain [166]\n\n\nHost cytokine response\nThe severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm [170] Levels of interleukin 1B, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with COVID‑19 disease severity Treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in COVID‑19 disease [171]\n\n\nPregnancy response\nThere are many unknowns for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic Given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures [173]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nCOVID‑19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions [27] [176] Along with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection [177] Detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection [27]\n\n\nViral testing\nThe standard methods of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 are nucleic acid tests, [27] [178] which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments [179] As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited\" [180] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used [181] [182] Results are generally available within hours [27] The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease [183]\n\n\nImaging\nChest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID‑19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening [177] [189] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection [177] [190] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses [177] [191] Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions [192]\n\n\nCoding\nIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID‑19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [194]\n\n\nPathology\nThe main pathological findings at autopsy are:\n\n\nPrevention\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, [200] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands [201] [202]\n\n\nVaccine\n\n\n\nFace masks and respiratory hygiene\n\n\n\nIndoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces\nThe CDC states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection [240] When indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission [240] [241] The WHO recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols [242] [243] [244]\n\n\nHand-washing and hygiene\nThorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required [246] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose [247] When soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol [248] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis\" Glycerol is added as a humectant [249]\n\n\nSocial distancing\nSocial distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others [250]\n\n\nSurface cleaning\nAfter being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days If a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection [253] Evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of COVID‑19, [254] [255] [256] leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes [257] [258] Deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air [259] [260]\n\n\nSelf-isolation\nSelf-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID‑19 and those who suspect they have been infected Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation [267] Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups [268] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID‑19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure [269]\n\n\nInternational travel-related control measures\nA 2021 Cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of COVID‑19 [270] Additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases [270] While test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up The review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of COVID‑19 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening [270]\n\n\nTreatment\n\nThe treatment and management of COVID-19 combines both supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support as needed, [271] [272] [273] and a growing list of approved medications Highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to SARS-CoV-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important [274]  Some people may experience persistent symptoms or disability after recovery from the infection, known as long COVID, but there is still limited information on the best management and rehabilitation for this condition [275]\n\n\nPrognosis and risk factors\nThe severity of COVID‑19 varies The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation [299] Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [109] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death [300] Abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with COVID-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support [301] [302] Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID‑19 and with a transfer to ICU [303] [304]\n\n\nGenetic risk factors\nGenetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off Covid [325] For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID‑19 [326] [327] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes [328] Some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations For instance, an allele of the DOCK2 gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in Asian populations but much less common in Europe The mutation leads to lower expression of DOCK2 especially in younger patients with severe Covid [329] In fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections [330]\n\n\nChildren\nWhile very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole [331] [332] Children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults [333] The CDC reports that in the US roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the ICU, [334] while a European multinational study of hospitalised children from June 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care [335] Four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the European study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study [336] [337]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nAround 10% to 30% of non-hospitalised people with COVID-19 go on to develop long COVID For those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence of long-term effects is over 50% [21] Long COVID is an often severe multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms There are likely various, possibly coinciding, causes [21] Organ damage from the acute infection can explain a part of the symptoms, but long COVID is also observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent [338]\n\n\nImmunity\nThe immune response by humans to SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production, [344] just as with most other infections [345] B cells interact with T cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen [346] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease [347] The presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection In another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms However, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2 Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms [347]\n\n\nMortality\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality [350] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health [351]\n\n\nCase fatality rate\nThe case fatality rate (CFR) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 March 2023 [356] The number varies by region [357] [351]\n\n\nInfection fatality rate\nA key metric in gauging the severity of COVID‑19 is the infection fatality rate (IFR), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk [360] [361] [362] This metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the CFR, the IFR incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases [363]\n\n\nEstimates\nA December 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population IFR during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and exceeded 2% in Italy [364] That study also found that most of these differences in IFR reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85 [364] These results were also highlighted in a December 2020 report issued by the WHO [365]\n\n\nEarlier estimates of IFR\nAt an early stage of the pandemic, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1% [366] [367] On 2 July, The WHO's chief scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6% [368] [369] In August, the WHO found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe showed IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1% [370] Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate (After sufficient time however, people can get reinfected) [371] As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID‑19 (0.3% of the population) [372] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ≈0.9%, [373] and ≈1.4% [374] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died [375] In September 2020, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific IFRs for public health planning purposes [376]\n\n\nSex differences\nCOVID‑19 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries However, in a few countries like India, Nepal, Vietnam, and Slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men [355] Globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the ICU and more likely to die [378] [379] One meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get COVID‑19 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (CI: 51.43–56.58) [380]\n\n\nEthnic differences\nIn the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID‑19 have occurred among African Americans and other minority groups [388] Structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes, [389] hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death [390] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities [388] On the one hand, in the Dominican Republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality In this Latin American territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects Dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of Haitian descent [391] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults [392] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water [392]\n\n\nComorbidities\nBiological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of COVID‑19 [355] Most of those who die of COVID‑19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, [389] and cardiovascular disease [398] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions [399] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases [300] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischaemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).\n\n\nHistory\nThe virus is thought to be of natural animal origin, most likely through spillover infection [104] [405] [406] A joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization indicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host [407] There are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing [408] According to articles published in July 2022 in Science, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in November 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the Huanan wet market in the city of Wuhan (Hubei, China) [409] [410] [411] Doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover [412] Earlier phylogenetics estimated that SARS-CoV-2 arose in October or November 2019 [413] [414] [415] A phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Guangdong before Wuhan [416]\n\n\nMisinformation\nAfter the initial outbreak of COVID‑19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online [466] [467] [468]\n\n\nOther species\nHumans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, [470] [471] a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis [472] [473]\n\n\nResearch\nInternational research on vaccines and medicines in COVID‑19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers [478] [479] The CDC has classified it to require a BSL3 grade laboratory [480] There has been a great deal of COVID‑19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand [481]\n\n\nTransmission and prevention research\nModelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission, [484] diagnosis and prognosis of infection, [485] estimation of the impact of interventions, [486] [487] or allocation of resources [488] Modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology, [489] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID‑19 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID‑19, [490] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure, [491] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission, [492] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic [493]\n\n\nTreatment-related research\nRepurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into COVID‑19 treatments [494] [495] Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [495]\n\n\nCytokine storm\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID‑19 A cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly A cytokine storm can lead to ARDS and multiple organ failure [515] Data collected from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China indicates that patients who had more severe responses to COVID‑19 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses These high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm [516]\n\n\nPassive antibodies\nTransferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID‑19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation [525] [526] Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2 The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies [527] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies [528] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID‑19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections [527] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible [525] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development [525]\n\n\nBioethics\nSince the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis [529] Academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators, [530] and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies [531] [532] The socio-economic inequalities between genders, [533] races, [534] groups with disabilities, [535] communities, [536] regions, countries, [537] and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public [538] [539]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nHealth agencies\n\n\nDirectories\n\n\nMedical
