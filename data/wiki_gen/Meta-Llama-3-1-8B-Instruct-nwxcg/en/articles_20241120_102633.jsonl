The book is a mystery, coming-of-age story set in the 1950s and 1960s in North Carolina. The novel follows the life of Kya Clark, a young girl who grows up in isolation in the marshes of Barkley Cove. The book has received widespread critical acclaim for its vivid portrayal of the natural world and its exploration of themes such as loneliness, love, and survival.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe novel is divided into two main parts: \"The Marsh\" and \"The Swamp\".\n\n### Part I: The Marsh\n\nIn 1952, six-year-old Catherine Danielle Clark, nicknamed \"Kya\", watches her mother abandon her and her family due to violent abuse from her husband, Kya's father. While Kya waits in vain for her mother's return, she witnesses her older siblings, Missy, Murph, Mandy, and Jodie, all leave as well, due to their father's drinking and physical abuse. After her mother leaves, her father burns most of her mother's wardrobe and paintings.\n\nKya is left alone in the marsh, with no one to care for her. She learns to fend for herself, relying on her wits and resourcefulness to survive. She becomes fascinated with the natural world around her, learning about the plants, animals, and insects that live in the marsh. She also becomes aware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows, including the threat of hunters and trappers who come to the marsh to exploit its resources.\n\nAs Kya grows older, she begins to experience the consequences of her isolation. She struggles to form relationships with others, fearing rejection and abandonment. She also struggles to understand her own identity and place in the world.\n\n### Part II: The Swamp\n\nIn 1965, Kya is 19. Chase Andrews, Barkley Cove's star quarterback and playboy, invites her to a picnic, during which he tries to have sex with her. He later apologizes, and the two form a romantic relationship. He shows her an abandoned fire tower, and she gives him a necklace of a shell he found during their picnic, strung on a rawhide string.\n\nDespite her suspicions, she believes Chase's promises of marriage and consummates their relationship in a cheap motel room in Asheville, North Carolina. After seeing in a newspaper that Chase has become engaged, Kya realizes his promises of marriage were a ruse. She then ends their relationship.\n\n**Ethology**\n\nEthology, the study of animal behavior, is a topic that is covered in the book. Kya reads about ethology, including an article titled \"Sneaky Fuckers\", where she learns about female fireflies, who use their coded flashing light signal to lure a male of another species to his death. She also learns about female mantises who lure a male mate and start eating the mate's head and thorax while his abdomen is still copulating with her.\n\nKya's fascination with ethology serves as a metaphor for her own experiences with love and relationships. She learns that in the natural world, there are predators and prey, and that survival often depends on cunning and adaptability.\n\n**Meaning of title**\n\nCrawdad is an American slang word for crayfish. These crustaceans cannot sing, but when Kya's mother encouraged her to explore the marsh, she would often say: \"Go as far as you can — way out yonder where the crawdads sing.\" When Tate also used the phrase, she asked him the meaning and he replied: \"Just means far in the bush where critters are wild, still behaving like critters.\" Owens's mother had used the phrase when she was a child.\n\nThe title of the book serves as a reminder of Kya's childhood and her relationship with her mother. It also serves as a metaphor for the natural world, where creatures are free to roam and behave as they please.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe book was selected for Reese Witherspoon's book club in September 2018 and for Barnes & Noble's Best Books of 2018.\n\n**Film adaptation**\n\nSony Pictures Releasing bought the film rights to the book, and Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine production company produced the film, with Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter as co-producers. Lucy Alibar adapted the book to film script. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Kya, with Taylor John Smith and Harris Dickinson as Tate Walker and Chase Andrews, respectively. Filming took place from mid-April through mid/late-June 2021 in and around New Orleans and Houma, Louisiana.

The book is a semi-autobiographical account of the author's experiences growing up in a wealthy and aristocratic family. The novel is a satirical exploration of the social conventions and mores of the British upper class in the early 20th century.\n\n**Plot summary**\n\nThe narrator of the novel is Fanny, whose mother (called the \"Bolter\" for her habit of serial monogamy) and father have left her to be brought up by her aunt Emily and the valetudinarian Davey, whom Emily marries early in the novel. Fanny also spends holidays with her uncle, Matthew Radlett, her aunt, Sadie, and numerous cousins at Alconleigh. Linda, the second Radlett daughter, is Fanny's best friend and the main character of the novel.\n\nThe early chapters of the novel recount the Radlett children's bizarre upbringing, including their contrasting obsessions with hunting and preventing cruelty to animals, and the activities of their secret society, the \"Hons\". The Radlett daughters receive little in the way of formal education, and as Linda grows older, she is increasingly consumed by a desire for romantic love and marriage.\n\nAs the novel progresses, the Radlett family's social status and reputation become increasingly intertwined with the lives of their acquaintances, particularly the aristocratic family of the Marquess of Rockingham. The novel's satirical tone is evident in its portrayal of the social conventions and class distinctions of the time, as well as the absurdities of the Radlett family's behavior.\n\n**The Radletts**\n\nThe Radlett family, as depicted in the novel, is a quintessential example of the British upper class in the early 20th century. The family is wealthy, aristocratic, and well-connected, but also eccentric, bohemian, and morally ambiguous. The characters are complex and multi-dimensional, with each one having their own distinct personality, quirks, and flaws.\n\nThe family's patriarch, Matthew Radlett, is a charming and affable figure, but also a bit of a drunkard and a womanizer. His wife, Sadie, is a strong-willed and independent woman who is determined to maintain the family's social status and reputation. The Radlett daughters, Linda and Fanny, are the main characters of the novel and are portrayed as intelligent, witty, and fiercely loyal to one another.\n\n**Other characters**\n\nIn addition to the Radlett family, the novel features a range of other characters who are equally well-drawn and memorable. These include the Marquess of Rockingham, a wealthy and aristocratic nobleman who becomes embroiled in the Radlett family's affairs; Sir Owen, a charming but slightly dodgy aristocrat who is a friend of the family; and Lady Rockingham's daughter, a beautiful and flirtatious young woman who becomes the object of Linda's affections.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nThe Pursuit of Love was adapted into a miniseries in 1980 by ITV, titled Love in a Cold Climate. The miniseries starred Alison Leggatt as Linda Radlett and was well-received by critics and audiences alike. The miniseries was a faithful adaptation of the novel, capturing the essence of the characters and the story while also bringing the story to life in a new and exciting way.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Nancy Mitford\n* Love in a Cold Climate\n* British upper class\n* Social satire\n* Aristocracy\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Pursuit of Love at Goodreads\n* The Pursuit of Love at Wikipedia\n* Love in a Cold Climate (1980 miniseries) at IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Pursuit_of_Love\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot summary\nThe narrator is Fanny, whose mother (called the \"Bolter\" for her habit of serial monogamy) and father have left her to be brought up by her aunt Emily and the valetudinarian Davey, whom Emily marries early in the novel Fanny also spends holidays with her uncle, Matthew Radlett, her aunt, Sadie and numerous cousins at Alconleigh Linda, the second Radlett daughter, is Fanny's best friend and the main character of the novel The early chapters recount the Radlett children's bizarre upbringing, including their contrasting obsessions with hunting and preventing cruelty to animals, and the activities of their secret society, the \"Hons\" The Radlett daughters receive little in the way of formal education, and as Linda grows older she is increasingly consumed by a desire for romantic love and marriage.\n\n\nThe Radletts\nIn 1980 The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate were adapted into an eight part miniseries by ITV under the title Love in a Cold Climate.\n\n\nOther characters\nIn 1980 The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate were adapted into an eight part miniseries by ITV under the title Love in a Cold Climate.\n\n\nAdaptations\nIn 1980 The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate were adapted into an eight part miniseries by ITV under the title Love in a Cold Climate.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Laines [2] in Plumpton, East Sussex [3]—and their London house in South Kensington [4] Her parents were British Army officer-turned-businessman Major Bruce Shand and his wife, Rosalind, daughter of Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe Camilla has a younger sister, Annabel Elliot, and had a younger brother, Mark Shand [5] One of her maternal great-grandmothers, Alice Keppel, was a mistress of King Edward VII [6] [7]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nIn the late 1960s, Shand met Andrew Parker Bowles, then a Guards officer – a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals through his younger brother, Simon, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair [29] After an on-and-off relationship for years, Parker Bowles and Shand's engagement was announced in The Times in 1973 [30] Sally Bedell Smith claimed that the announcement was sent out by the pair's parents without their knowledge, which forced Parker Bowles to propose [31] They married on 4 July 1973 in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, in London [32] Shand was 25 years old and Parker Bowles 33 Her wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, [32] and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles's goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert [33] It was considered the \"society wedding of the year\" [34] with 800 guests [32] Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne; the Queen's sister, Margaret; and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [34]\n\n\nFirst marriage\nIn the late 1960s, Shand met Andrew Parker Bowles, then a Guards officer – a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals through his younger brother, Simon, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair [29] After an on-and-off relationship for years, Parker Bowles and

with 800 guests [32] Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne; the Queen's sister, Margaret; and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [34]\n\n\nRelationship with Charles\nShand reportedly met Prince Charles in mid-1971 [46] Andrew Parker Bowles had ended his relationship with Shand in 1970 and was courting Princess Anne [47] Though Shand and Charles belonged to the same social circle and occasionally attended the same events, they had not formally met Gyles Brandreth states that they did not first meet at a polo match, as has been commonly believed [48] [49] Instead, they first met at the home of their friend Lucía Santa Cruz, who formally introduced them [25] [50] They became close friends and eventually began a romantic relationship, which was well known within their social circle [51] As a couple, they regularly met at polo matches at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, where Charles often played polo [52] They also became part of a set at Annabel's in Berkeley Square [46] As the relationship grew more serious, Charles met Shand's family in Plumpton, and he introduced her to some members of his family [53] The relationship was put on hold after Charles travelled overseas to join the Royal Navy in early 1973, and ended abruptly afterward [1] [54]\n\n\nImage rehabilitation\nFollowing both of their divorces, Charles declared his relationship with Parker Bowles was \"non-negotiable\" [79] Charles was aware that the relationship was receiving a lot of negative publicity, and appointed Mark Bolland—whom he had employed in 1995 to refurbish his own image‍—‌to enhance Parker Bowles's public profile [80] In July 1997, she was involved in a head-on car accident while driving to Highgrove House, though neither she nor the other driver sustained any major injuries [81] Parker Bowles occasionally became Charles's unofficial companion at events In 1999, they made their first public appearance together at the Ritz London Hotel, where they attended a birthday party for her sister; about 200 photographers and reporters from around the world were there to witness them together [82] In 2000, she accompanied Charles to Scotland for a number of official engagements, and in 2001, she became president of the Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS), which introduced her to the public [83]\n\n\nSecond marriage\nOn 10 February 2005, Clarence House publicised the engagement of Camilla Parker Bowles and the Prince of Wales As an engagement ring, Charles gave Parker Bowles a diamond ring believed to have been given to his grandmother when she gave birth to Charles's mother [97] The ring comprised a square-cut diamond with three diamond baguettes on each side [98] As the future supreme governor of the Church of England, the prospect of Charles marrying a divorcée was seen as controversial, but with the consent of the Queen, [99] the government, [100] and the Church of England, the couple were able to wed The Queen and Tony Blair, along with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, offered their best wishes in statements to the media [101] In the two months following the announcement of their engagement, Clarence House received 25,000 letters with \"95 or 99 per cent being supportive\"; 908 hate mail letters were also received, with the more threatening and personal ones sent to the police for investigation [102]\n\n\nDuchess of Cornwall\nAfter becoming Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla automatically acquired rank as the second highest woman in the British order of precedence (after Queen Elizabeth II), and as typically fifth or sixth in the orders of precedence of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant viceroy, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales Within two years of the marriage, the Queen extended Camilla visible tokens of membership in the royal family: she lent Camilla the Greville Tiara, which previously belonged to the Queen Mother, [113] and granted her the badge of the Royal Family Order of Elizabeth II [114]\n\n\nForeign and domestic trips\nCamilla's first solo engagement as Duchess of Cornwall was a visit to Southampton General

in Maryland to give a presentation on osteoporosis to high-profile health figures [214]\n\n\nVictims of rape and sexual abuse\nAfter visiting nine rape crisis centres in 2009 and hearing accounts from

McConnell, a nearby tabloid journalist, also intervened, and was shot in the chest [55] Ball approached Anne's car and told her that he intended to kidnap her and hold her for ransom, the sum given by varying sources as £2 million [56] or £3 million, which he claimed he intended to give to the National Health Service [53] Ball told Anne to get out of the car, to which she replied, \"Not bloody

media often called the young Anne \"aloof\" and \"haughty\", giving her the nickname \"her royal rudeness\" [131] She spurred controversy for telling photographers to \"naff off\" at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1982 [133] Vanity Fair wrote that Anne \"has a reputation for having inherited her father's famously sharp tongue and waspish wit\" [133] Of her early public role, she has said: \"It's not just about 'can I get a tick in the box for doing this?' No, it's about serving…It took me probably 10 years before I really felt confident enough to contribute to Save the Children's public debates because you needed to understand how it works on the ground and that needed a very wide coverage So my early trips were really important.\" [133] Anne has been frequently named the \"hardest working royal\", [134] [135] and she carried out 11,088 engagements between 2002 and 2022, more than any other member of the royal family [136]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nAnne is the seventh Princess Royal, [4] an appellation given only to the eldest daughter of the Sovereign The previous holder was King George V's daughter, Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood, Anne's great-aunt.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nAnne is the seventh Princess Royal, [4] an appellation given only to the eldest daughter of the Sovereign The previous holder was King George V's daughter, Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood, Anne's great-aunt.\n\n\nHonours\nAnne is a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, [156] [d] an Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, [156] [d] Grand Master of the Royal Victorian Order, [159] a Dame Grand Cross of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, [160] a Recipient of the Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II, [161] and a Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Sovereign.\n\n\nArms\nDivorced 14 June 2021\n\n\nIssue\nDivorced 14 June 2021\n\n\nAncestry\nThe Princess Royal's ancestry can be traced as far back as Cerdic, King of Wessex (519–534) [165]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\nForewords\n\n\nLectures\n\n\nGuest-editor\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Introduction\n\nAnne, Princess Royal, is a British royal and member of the House of Windsor.

As was customary for untitled men marrying into the royal family, Phillips was offered an earldom, which he declined; consequently their children were born without titles. Anne and her husband had two children: Peter (born 1977) and Zara Phillips (born 1981). Anne and Phillips have five grandchildren. On 31 August 1989, Anne and Phillips announced their intention to separate; the couple had been rarely seen in public together and both were romantically linked with other people. They shared custody of their children, and initially announced that \"there were no plans for divorce.\" On 13 April 1992, the Palace announced that Anne had filed for divorce, which was finalised ten days later.\n\n# Marriage to Sir Timothy Laurence\n\nAnne met Timothy Laurence, a commander in the Royal Navy, while he was serving on the Royal Yacht Britannia. Their relationship developed in early 1989, three years after Laurence was appointed as an equerry to the Queen. In 1989, the existence of private letters from Laurence to Anne was revealed by The Sun newspaper. The couple married at Crathie Kirk near Balmoral Castle in Scotland, on 12 December 1992. Approximately 30 guests were invited for the private marriage service. Unlike the Church of England at the time, the Church of Scotland considered marriage to be an ordinance of religion rather than a sacrament and permitted the remarriage of divorced persons under certain circumstances. Anne became the first royal divorcée to remarry since Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, granddaughter of Queen Victoria.\n\n# Kidnapping Attempt\n\nOn 20 March 1974, Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were returning to Buckingham Palace from a charity event when a Ford Escort forced their Princess IV car to stop on The Mall. The driver of the Escort, Ian Ball, jumped out and began firing a pistol. Inspector James Beaton, Anne's personal protection officer, exited the car to shield her and to try to disarm Ball. Ball's firearm, a Walther PPK, jammed, and he was shot by Ball, as was Anne's chauffeur, Alex Callender, when he tried to disarm Ball. Brian McConnell, a nearby tabloid journalist, also intervened, and was shot in the chest. Ball approached Anne's car and told her that he intended to kidnap her and hold her for ransom. The sum given by varying sources as £2 million or £3 million, which he claimed he intended to give to the National Health Service. Ball told Anne to get out of the car, to which she replied, \"Not bloody likely!\" She reportedly briefly considered hitting Ball. In 1983, she spoke about the event on Parkinson, saying she was 'scrupulously polite' to Ball as she thought it would be 'silly to be too rude at that stage'.\n\n# Activities\n\nAnne undertakes a number of duties and engagements on behalf of the sovereign. Kevin S MacLeod, the then Canadian Secretary to the Queen, said of Anne in 2014: \"Her credo is, 'Keep me busy I'm here to work I'm here to do good things I'm here to meet as many people as possible'.\" It was reported in December 2017 that the Princess Royal had undertaken the most official engagements that year out of all the royal family, her mother the Queen included. Among her royal visits, the Princess has toured Norway, Jamaica, Germany, Austria, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\n# Patronages\n\nAnne is involved with over 200 charities and organisations in an official capacity. She works extensively for Save the Children, serving as president from 1970 to 2017, and has been patron since 2017. Anne has visited the organisation's projects in Bangladesh, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result of her work, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 by Kenneth Kaunda, President of Zambia. She initiated The Princess Royal Trust for Carers in 1991. Her extensive work for St John Ambulance as Commandant-in-Chief of St John Ambulance Cadets has helped to develop many young people, as she annually attends the Grand Prior Award Reception. She is patron of St Andrew's First Aid. In 2021, she became patron of Mercy Ships, an international charity that operates the largest non-governmental hospital ships in the world.\n\n# Public Image and Style\n\nAnne has been called the royal family's \"trustiest anchor\" and a \"beacon of good, old-fashioned public service\", having carried out over 20,000 engagements since her 18th birthday. In her early adulthood, she was cited as a \"royal renegade\" for choosing to forgo titles for her children despite being the \"spare to the heir\". The media often called the young Anne \"aloof\" and \"haughty\", giving her the nickname \"her royal rudeness\". She spurred controversy for telling photographers to \"naff off\" at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1982. Vanity Fair wrote that Anne \"has a reputation for having inherited her father's famously sharp tongue and waspish wit\". Of her early public role, she has said: \"It's not just about 'can I get a tick in the box for doing this?' No, it's about serving…It took me probably 10 years before I really felt confident enough to contribute to Save the Children's public debates because you needed to understand how it works on the ground and that needed a very wide coverage So my early trips were really important.\" Anne has been frequently named the \"hardest working royal\", and she carried out 11,088 engagements between 2002 and 2022, more than any other member of the royal family.\n\n# Titles, Styles, Honours and Arms\n\nAnne is the seventh Princess Royal, an appellation given only to the eldest daughter of the Sovereign. The previous holder was King George V's daughter, Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood, Anne's great-aunt. Anne is a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, an Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, Grand Master of the Royal Victorian Order, a Dame Grand Cross of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, a Recipient of the Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II, and a Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Sovereign.", "prompt": "Write

The flag has a rich history and has been used by various groups and individuals in different contexts, including American patriotism, libertarianism, and right-wing politics.\n\n**Appearance and Symbolism**\n\nThe Gadsden flag typically features a coiled rattlesnake on a yellow or gold background, with the motto \"Don't Tread on Me\" written in a bold, sans-serif font. The snake is usually depicted as coiled and ready to strike, with its body forming a circle around the center of the flag. The motto is written in a straightforward and bold font, emphasizing the idea of resistance to oppression.\n\nHowever, many variations of the Gadsden flag exist, and the motto may or may not include an apostrophe in the word \"Don't\". The typeface used for the motto may also be serif or sans-serif. In some representations, the rattlesnake is shown as resting on a green ground, while others display nothing below the snake. The rattlesnake usually faces to the left, but some versions show the snake facing to the right.\n\n**History of the Rattlesnake Symbol in America**\n\nThe timber rattlesnake can be found in the area of the original Thirteen Colonies, and its significance lies in its uniqueness to the Americas. The use of the rattlesnake as a symbol of the American colonies can be traced back to the publications of Benjamin Franklin. In 1751, he made the first reference to the rattlesnake in a satirical commentary published in his Pennsylvania Gazette.\n\nThe policy of the British Parliament to send convicted criminals to Britain's North American colonies led Franklin to suggest that Americans thank Parliament by sending rattlesnakes to Britain. This satirical commentary marked the beginning of the use of the rattlesnake as a symbol of American resistance and patriotism.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Gadsden flag was first introduced by Christopher Gadsden, a Continental Army general, in 1775. Gadsden presented the flag to the Continental Congress, which adopted it as the official flag of the Continental Navy. The flag was designed to be a symbol of American patriotism and resistance to British rule.\n\nThe Continental Navy, established by George Washington in 1775, used the Gadsden flag as its official flag. The first ships of the Continental Navy were used to intercept incoming transport ships carrying war supplies to the British in the colonies. This marked the beginning of the American Revolutionary War.\n\n**Modern Use**\n\nFor historical reasons, the Gadsden flag is still popularly flown in Charleston, South Carolina, the city where Christopher Gadsden first presented the flag. The flag was also commonly used during the revolution, along with the blue and white crescent flag of pre-Civil War South Carolina.\n\nIn the 1970s, libertarians began using the Gadsden flag as a symbol to represent individual rights and limited government. The flag's prominent yellow or gold color is also strongly associated with libertarianism. The libertarian Free State Project in New Hampshire uses a modified version of the flag with the snake replaced by a porcupine, a symbol of the libertarian movement.\n\n**Use by the Left**\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the New Left People's Bicentennial Commission used the Gadsden flag symbolism on buttons and literature. This marked one of the first instances of the Gadsden flag being used by left-wing groups.\n\n**Use by the Right**\n\nThe Gadsden flag has also been used by groups and individuals on the right. The flag was featured prominently in a report related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol. This marked a significant instance of the Gadsden flag being used as a symbol of right-wing extremism.\n\n**Use as a Symbol of the Tea Party Movement**\n\nBeginning in 2009, the Gadsden flag was widely used as a protest symbol by protesters who supported the American Tea Party movement. The flag was also displayed by members of Congress at Tea Party rallies. In some cases, the flag was ruled to be a political, rather than a historic or military, symbol due to the strong Tea Party connection.\n\n**Used in a Terrorist Act**\n\nIn 2014, the flag was used by Jerad and Amanda Miller, the perpetrators of the 2014 Las Vegas shootings, who killed two police officers and a citizen. The Millers reportedly placed the Gadsden Flag on the corpse of one of the officers they killed. This marked a dark and sinister instance of the Gadsden flag being used as a symbol of violence and extremism.\n\n**Legal Cases Involving the Gadsden Flag**\n\nIn March 2013, the Gadsden flag was raised at a vacant armory building in New Rochelle, New York, without permission from city officials. The city ordered its removal, and the United Veterans Memorial & Patriotic Association, which had maintained the U.S. flag at the armory, filed suit against the city. A federal judge dismissed the case, rejecting the United Veterans' First Amendment argument and ruling that the flagpole in question was city property and thus did not represent private speech.\n\n**Rainbow Version**\n\nStreet Patrol, a 1990s queer self-defense group affiliated with Queer Nation/San Francisco, used as its logo a coiled snake over a triangle holding a ribbon with the motto \"Don't Tread on Me\". Some libertarian circles use a version of the flag with the snake and motto placed over a rainbow flag. Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, posters containing a rainbow Gadsden flag inscribed with \"#ShootBack\" were placed around West Hollywood.\n\n**Use Outside the U.S.**\n\nThe Gadsden flag has been used by supporters of Argentine right-libertarian president Javier Milei. During Milei's inauguration, there were Gadsden flags flown, which is one of the first times the flag was flown with notability in a foreign inauguration.\n\n**Parodies**\n\nParodies and pastiches of the Gadsden flag exist, with one common design replacing the \"Don't tread on me\" motto with \"No Step on Snek\", sometimes paired with a crudely drawn snake.\n\n**Appearances in Popular Culture**\n\nThe Gadsden flag has made numerous appearances in popular culture, particularly in post-apocalyptic stories. The flag has been featured in various films, television shows, and music videos, often as a symbol of resistance or rebellion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Gadsden flag is a complex and multifaceted symbol with a rich history and multiple meanings. From its origins as a symbol of American patriotism and resistance to British rule to its modern uses as a libertarian and right-wing symbol, the flag has been used in various contexts and has been subject to different interpretations. While the flag has been used by extremist groups in the past, it remains a powerful symbol of American identity and a reminder of the country's complex and often contentious history.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gadsden_flag\" following this outline:\n\n\nAppearance and symbolism\nMany variations of the Gadsden flag exist The motto may or may not include an apostrophe in the word \"Don't\";

{"title": "2023–24_South_Pacific_cyclone_season", "content": "\nSeasonal forecasts\nAhead of the season officially starting on November 1, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) and the University of Newcastle's Australian Centre for Water, Climate and Land (ACWCL), each issued a tropical cyclone outlook that discussed the upcoming season These outlooks took into account a variety of factors such as a developing El Niño event and what had happened in previous seasons such as 1972–73, 1982–83, 1987–88, 1991–92, 1997–98, 2002–03, 2004–05, 2009–10 and 2015–16 [1] [5]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nThe season began with the formation of Cyclone Lola on October 19, thirteen days before the official start of the season Three days later, it rapidly intensified into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, making it the strongest pre-season cyclone in a South Pacific cyclone season since Cyclone Xavier in 2006 In November, Cyclone Mal would form, peak as a severe tropical cyclone, and impact Fiji before dissipating On December 2, the precursor disturbance to Cyclone Jasper would form before entering the Australian region a day later.\n\n\nSystems\nOn October 19, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that Tropical Disturbance 01F had developed out of an area of low pressure, about 1295 km (805 mi) to the northeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands [7] [8] At this time, the system was located in an area favourable for further development, with warm sea-surface temperatures of 30–31 °C (86–88 °F) and low to moderate vertical wind shear [7] [9] Over the next few days, the system gradually moved southwestward before the FMS classified it as a tropical depression on October 21 [10] The cyclone drifted southward until an upper-level ridge forced the storm to the south [11] During the next day, it intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, resulting in the FMS naming it Lola [12] Lola would rapidly intensify, becoming a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 12:00 UTC that day, peaking with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) [13] With convective rain bands wrapping into the circulation, the JTWC assessed Lola as having one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) [14] At the same time, the FMS followed suit and upgraded the system to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone [15] Lola's eye quickly disappeared, signaling a phase of rapid weakening [16] It would steadily weaken before making landfall in Sowan, around 03:00 UTC on October 25 [17] Lola would rapidly weaken, becoming a tropical depression on October 26, and degenerating into a remnant low as the JTWC issued their final advisory on Lola [18] [19]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Lola\nOn October 19, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that Tropical Disturbance 01F had developed out of an area of low pressure, about 1295 km (805 mi) to the northeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands [7] [8] At this time, the system was located in an area favourable for further development, with warm sea-surface temperatures of 30–31 °C (86–88 °F) and low to moderate vertical wind shear [7] [9] Over the next few days, the system gradually moved southwestward before the FMS classified it as a tropical depression on October 21 [10] The cyclone drifted southward until an upper-level ridge forced the storm to the south [11] During the next day, it intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, resulting in the FMS naming it Lola [12] Lola would rapidly intensify, becoming a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 12:00 UTC that day, peaking with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) [13] With convective rain bands wrapping into the circulation, the JTWC assessed Lola as having one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) [14] At the same time, the FMS followed suit and upgraded the system to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone [15] Lola's eye quickly disappeared, signaling a phase of rapid weakening [16] It would steadily weaken before making landfall in Sowan, around 03:00 UTC on October 25 [17] Lola would rapidly weaken, becoming a tropical depression on October 26, and degenerating into a remnant low as the JTWC issued their final advisory on Lola [18] [19]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Mal\nOn November 11, the FMS reported that Tropical Disturbance 02F had formed near the Solomon Islands and moved towards Fiji [23] Although the disturbance was disorganized, it underwent further development from warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate vertical wind shear [24] By November 12, the system intensified into a tropical depression [25] Persistent deep convection then organized as rainbands circulate around the center [26] It intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone later on November 13, with the FMS naming it as Mal [27] Mal continued to strengthen over the favorable conditions as well as high ocean heat content  Hot towers also rose around the center of the storm, a sign of consolidation [28] On November 14, it intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone [29] As the storm continued to move southeast by the southwest edge of a subtropical ridge, Mal strengthened into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC of the same day [30] On November 15, it began to weaken as it entered an environment of high wind shear [31] It later entered the New Zealand MetService's area of responsibility, where it was reclassified as an ex-tropical cyclone [32]\n\n\nTropical Disturbance 03F (Jasper)\nOn December 2, the FMS declared that Tropical Disturbance 03F had formed [39] Analysis from the JTWC indicated that the disturbance was in a favorable environment for development, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear [40] Moving southward, the disturbance would exit the basin on December 4 and enter the Australian region, where the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) assumed responsibility for the system In the Australian basin, the system would later intensify into Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasper [41] [42]\n\n\nTropical Disturbance 04F\nOn January 25, the FMS reported that Tropical Disturbance 04F had developed about 110 km (70 mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji [45] [46] At this stage, the system was poorly organised and lied under the eastern edge of an upper-level ridge of high pressure in a low to moderate area of vertical wind shear, with sea surface temperatures near 29 °C (84 °F) [45] The next day, they stopped monitoring the system [47]\n\n\nTropical Depression 05F\nOn February 1, Subtropical Low 06U entered the basin from the Australian region and was reclassified as 05F by the FMS [48] Under a moderately sheared environment with warm sea surface temperatures The disturbance's convective structure rapidly deteriorated in the low-level circulation center (LLLC) [49] However, the system quickly re-developed LLLC, and three days later, [50] [51] the system moved eastwards onto the boundary of the region—the 160th meridian east—at approximately 12:00 UTC on February 5, before returning to the Southern Pacific basin proper on February 7, and the JTWC issued a TCFA on the low, noting that it was likely to intensify significantly [52] [53] The next day, the agency upgraded the system to tropical storm, initiating advisories on it as Tropical Cyclone 12P [54] The storm continued to be negatively effected by northwesterly wind shear [55] Later, the storm began undergoing rapid expansion, with a central cold cover along with colder convective tops [56] However, as it moved over Epi island in Vanuatu, its weakly-defined and exposed LLLC embedded in deep convection [57] [58] Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued their final warning, as it became elongated due to a dry air intrusion [59] [60] Over the next few weeks, the FMS continued monitoring the system as a tropical disturbance, before it was last noted as it moved into the MetService's area of responsibility on February 28 [61]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Nat\nOn February 3, the JTWC started to monitor a subtropical disturbance that had persisted about 815 km (505 mi) to the south-southeast of Nadi, Fiji, within an area that was marginally conducive to further development [64] During that day, the system moved north-eastwards before it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 06F by the FMS, while it was located about 270 km (165 mi) to the southwest of Pago Pago in American Samoa [65] Two days later, they upgraded the system into a tropical depression [66] The next day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [67]  A few hours later, they recognized the system as Tropical Cyclone 10P [68] Later that day, the FMS upgraded the system into a tropical cyclone, naming it Nat [69] Despite partially exposing the LLLC and degrading its deep convection, the FMS upgraded the system into a Category 2 tropical cyclone on February 6 [70] [71] The intrusion of dry air lead to Nat to continue rapidly weakening [72] By February 8, the JTWC subsequently issued its final advisory on Nat, [73] as it moved steadily east-southwards within an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear, the LLCC became exposed later [74] [75] Under a mid-latitude upper low, it became strongly influenced by the low and started to exhibit subtropical characteristics, prompting the JTWC to classify the storm as a subtropical cyclone at 23:00 UTC on that day [76] The system then moved into TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility on February 10, where it was reclassified as a non-tropical low, [77] although the JTWC later reported that the system had dissipated that day [78]\n\n\nTropical Disturbance 07F\nOn February 5, the FMS noted that Tropical Disturbance 07F had developed within an area of moderate vertical windshear about 705 km (440 mi) to the northwest of Papeete in French Polynesia [81] [82] During that day, atmospheric convection persisted over the low level circulation, as it moved south-eastwards and passed through French Polynesia's Society Islands [82] [83]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Osai\nOn February 6, the FMS stated that Tropical Disturbance 08F had formed [84] The disturbance was located within a favorable environment for further development with good equator-ward outflow, exceptionally warm (29–30 °C) sea surface temperatures [85] Deep convection with formative bands surrounding the system's circulation caused the JTWC to issue a TCFA that day at 06:00 UTC, with the system located about 595 km (370 mi) northwest of Pago Pago in American Samoa [86] During that day, the system continued to develop and was classified as a tropical depression by the FMS [87] The JTWC followed suit a few hours later, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 11P [88] A few hours later, the FMS upgraded 08F into a tropical cyclone, naming it Osai [89] Osai showed a consolidating system with convective banding wrapping into a well-defined LLLC [90]  Soon, it started experiencing an increase in vertical wind shear [91] By February 8, the circulation had become exposed, prompting the JTWC and FMS to issue their final warning on Osai [92] [93] Over the next few days, Osai moved slowly over the South Pacific Ocean as a tropical disturbance before it was last noted on February 12 [94] [95]\n\n\nTropical Disturbance 09F\nOn February 11, the FMS noted that Tropical Disturbance 09F had developed within an area of high vertical windshear about 160 km (100 mi) to the southwest of Papeete in French Polynesia [96] Over the next couple of days, the disturbance moved south-eastwards and remained poorly organised with atmospheric convection displaced to the east of the low-level circulation centre, before it was last noted on February 13, as it dissipated to the north of the island of Rapa in French Polynesia [97] [98] [99]\n\n\nTropical Depression 10F\nOn February 14, the FMS noted that Tropical Depression 10F had formed about 350 km (215 mi) to the northeast of Palmerston in the Southern Cook Islands [100] During the next day, the system intensified as it moved south-eastward in a weak steering environment, while the storm started to wrap into the system's consolidating LLLC [101] The system embedded within the South Pacific Convergence Zone, to the northeast of Niue, leading the JTWC to issue a TCFA [102] During the day, the JTWC initiated advisories on the disturbance and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 15P [103] By February 17, the system had transitioned to a subtropical cyclone, prompting the JTWC to discontinue warnings on the system [104] The FMS still tracked the system until the next day [105]\n\n\nTropical Disturbance 11F\nOn March 8, the FMS stated that Tropical Disturbance 11F had formed [106] The next day, the JTWC began monitoring it [107] They stopped monitoring it the next day [108] The FMS kept monitoring it until 11F dissipated on March 15 [109]\n\n\nTropical Disturbance 12F\nOn March 18, the FMS began monitoring a tropical disturbance [110] By the next day, they stopped monitoring it [111]\n\nStorm names\nWithin the Southern Pacific, a tropical depression is judged to have reached tropical cyclone intensity should it reach winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) and it is evident that gales are occurring at least halfway around the center With tropical depressions intensifying into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 25°S and between 160°E - 120°W named by the FMS However, should a tropical depression intensify to the south of 25°S between 160°E and 120°W it will be named in conjunction with the FMS by MetService The names Mal, Nat and Osai were used for

tropical cyclones formed in the South Pacific Ocean. It started on November 1, 2023, and ended on April 30, 2024. The season was slightly above average in terms of the number of tropical cyclones that formed.\n\nSeasonal Forecasts\nAhead of the season officially starting on November 1, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), and the University of Newcastle's Australian Centre for Water, Climate and Land (ACWCL), each issued a tropical cyclone outlook that discussed the upcoming season. These outlooks took into account a variety of factors such as a developing El Niño event and what had happened in previous seasons. \n\nSeasonal Summary\nThe season began with the formation of Cyclone Lola on October 19, thirteen days before the official start of the season. Three days later, it rapidly intensified into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, making it the strongest pre-season cyclone in a South Pacific cyclone season since Cyclone Xavier in 2006. In November, Cyclone Mal would form, peak as a severe tropical cyclone, and impact Fiji before dissipating. On December 2, the precursor disturbance to Cyclone Jasper would form before entering the Australian region a day later.\n\nSystems\n## Cyclone Lola\nOn October 19, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) reported that Tropical Disturbance 01F had developed out of an area of low pressure, about 1295 km (805 mi) to the northeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands. At this time, the system was located in an area favourable for further development, with warm sea-surface temperatures of 30–31 °C (86–88 °F) and low to moderate vertical wind shear. Over the next few days, the system gradually moved southwestward before the FMS classified it as a tropical depression on October 21. The cyclone drifted southward until an upper-level ridge forced the storm to the south. During the next day, it intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, resulting in the FMS naming it Lola. Lola would rapidly intensify, becoming a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 12:00 UTC that day, peaking with maximum ten-minute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). With convective rain bands wrapping into the circulation, the JTWC assessed Lola as having one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). At the same time, the FMS followed suit and upgraded the system to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. Lola's eye quickly disappeared, signaling a phase of rapid weakening. It would steadily weaken before making landfall in Sowan, around 03:00 UTC on October 25. Lola would rapidly weaken, becoming a tropical depression on October 26, and degenerating into a remnant low as the JTWC issued their final advisory on Lola.\n\n## Cyclone Mal\nOn November 11, the FMS reported that Tropical Disturbance 02F had formed near the Solomon Islands and moved towards Fiji. Although the disturbance was disorganized, it underwent further development from warm sea-surface temperatures and low to moderate vertical wind shear. By November 12, the system intensified into a tropical depression. Persistent deep convection then organized as rainbands circulated around the center. It intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone later on November 13, with the FMS naming it as Mal. Mal continued to strengthen over the favorable conditions as well as high ocean heat content. Hot towers also rose around the center of the storm, a sign of consolidation. On November 14, it intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone. As the storm continued to move southeast by the southwest edge of a subtropical ridge, Mal strengthened into a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC of the same day. On November 15, it began to weaken as it entered an environment of high wind shear. It later entered the New Zealand MetService's area of responsibility, where it was reclassified as an ex-tropical cyclone.\n\n## Tropical Disturbance 03F (Jasper)\nOn December 2, the FMS declared that Tropical Disturbance 03F had formed. Analysis from the JTWC indicated that the disturbance was in a favorable environment for development, with warm sea-surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear. Moving southward, the disturbance would exit the basin on December 4 and enter the Australian region, where the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) assumed responsibility for the system. In the Australian basin, the system would later intensify into Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasper.\n\n## Tropical Disturbance 04F\nOn January 25, the FMS reported that Tropical Disturbance 04F had developed about 110 km (70 mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. At this stage, the system was poorly organised and lied under the eastern edge of an upper-level ridge of high pressure in a low to moderate area of vertical wind shear, with sea-surface temperatures near 29 °C (84 °F). The next day, they stopped monitoring the system.\n\n## Tropical Depression 05F\nOn February 1, Subtropical Low 06U entered the basin from the Australian region and was reclassified as 05F by the FMS. Under a moderately sheared environment with warm sea-surface temperatures, the disturbance's convective structure rapidly deteriorated in the low-level circulation center (LLLC). However, the system quickly re-developed LLLC, and three days later, the system moved eastwards onto the boundary of the region—the 160th meridian east—at approximately 12:00 UTC on February 5, before returning to the Southern Pacific basin proper on February 7, and the JTWC issued a TCFA on the low, noting that it was likely to intensify significantly. The next day, the agency upgraded the system to tropical storm, initiating advisories on it as Tropical Cyclone 12P. The storm continued to be negatively affected by northwesterly wind shear. Later, the storm began undergoing rapid expansion, with a central cold cover along with colder convective tops. However, as it moved over Epi island in Vanuatu, its weakly-defined and exposed LLLC embedded in deep convection. Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued their final warning, as it became elongated due to a dry air intrusion. Over the next few weeks, the FMS continued monitoring the system as a tropical disturbance, before it was last noted as it moved into the MetService's area of responsibility on February 28.\n\n## Tropical Cyclone Nat\nOn February 3, the JTWC started to monitor a subtropical disturbance that had persisted about 815 km (505 mi) to the south-southeast of Nadi, Fiji, within an area that was marginally conducive to further development. During that day, the system moved north-eastwards before it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 06F by the FMS, while it was located about 270 km (165 mi) to the southwest of Pago Pago in American Samoa. Two days later, they upgraded the system into a tropical depression. The next day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system. A few hours later, they recognized the system as Tropical Cyclone 10P. Later that day, the FMS upgraded the system into a tropical cyclone, naming it Nat. Despite partially exposing the LLLC and degrading its deep convection, the FMS upgraded the system into a Category 2 tropical cyclone on February 6. The intrusion of dry air led to Nat to continue rapidly weakening. By February 8, the JTWC subsequently issued its final advisory on Nat, as it moved steadily east-southwards within an environment of warm sea-surface temperatures and moderate wind shear, the LLCC became exposed later. Under a mid-latitude upper low, it became strongly influenced by the low and started to exhibit subtropical characteristics, prompting the JTWC to classify the storm as a subtropical cyclone at 23:00 UTC on that day. The system then moved into TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility on February 10, where it was reclassified as a non-tropical low, although the JTWC later reported that the system had dissipated that day.\n\n## Tropical Disturbance 07F\nOn February 5, the FMS noted that Tropical Disturbance 07F had developed within an area of moderate vertical wind shear about 705 km (440 mi) to the northwest of Papeete in French Polynesia. During that day, atmospheric convection persisted over the low-level circulation, as it moved south-eastwards and passed through French Polynesia's Society Islands.\n\n## Tropical Cyclone Osai\nOn February 6, the FMS stated that Tropical Disturbance 08F had formed. The disturbance was located within a favorable environment for further development with good equator-ward outflow, exceptionally warm (29–30 °C) sea-surface temperatures. Deep convection with formative bands surrounding the system's circulation caused the JTWC to issue a TCFA that day at 06:00 UTC, with the system located about 595 km (370 mi) northwest of Pago Pago in American Samoa. During that day, the system continued to develop and was classified as a tropical depression by the FMS. The JTWC followed suit a few hours later, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 11P. A few hours later, the FMS upgraded 08F into a tropical cyclone, naming it Osai. Osai showed a consolidating system with convective banding wrapping into a well-defined LLLC. Soon, it started experiencing an increase in vertical wind shear. By February 8, the circulation had become exposed, prompting the JTWC and FMS to issue their final warning on Osai. Over the next few days, Osai moved slowly over the South Pacific Ocean as a tropical disturbance before it was last noted on February 12.\n\n## Tropical Disturbance 09F\nOn February 11, the FMS noted that Tropical Disturbance 09F had developed within an area of high vertical wind shear about 160 km (100 mi) to the southwest of Papeete in French Polynesia. Over the next couple of days, the disturbance moved south-eastwards and remained poorly organised with atmospheric convection displaced to the east of the low-level circulation centre, before it was last noted on February 13, as it dissipated to the north of the island of Rapa in French Polynesia.\n\n## Tropical Depression 10F\nOn February 14, the FMS noted that Tropical Depression 10F had formed about 350 km (215 mi) to the northeast of Palmerston in the Southern Cook Islands. During the next day, the system intensified as it moved south-eastward in a weak steering environment, while the storm started to wrap into the system's consolidating LLLC. The system embedded within the South Pacific Convergence Zone, to the northeast of Niue, leading the JTWC to issue a TCFA. During the day, the JTWC initiated advisories on the disturbance and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 15P. By February 17, the system had transitioned to a subtropical cyclone, prompting the JTWC to discontinue warnings on the system. The FMS still tracked the system until the next day.\n\n## Tropical Disturbance 11F\nOn March 8, the FMS stated that Tropical Disturbance 11F had formed. The next day, the JTWC began monitoring it. They stopped monitoring it the next day. The FMS kept monitoring it until 11F dissipated on March 15.\n\n## Tropical Disturbance 12F\nOn March 18, the FMS began monitoring a tropical disturbance. By the next day, they stopped monitoring it.\n\nStorm Names\nWithin the Southern Pacific, a tropical depression is judged to have reached tropical cyclone intensity should it reach winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) and it is evident that gales are occurring at least halfway around the center. With tropical depressions intensifying into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 25°S and between 160°E - 120°W named by the FMS. However, should a tropical depression intensify to the south of 25°S between 160°E and 120°W it will be named in conjunction with the FMS by MetService. The names Mal, Nat and Osai were used for the first time (and the only time for Mal), as they replaced Meena, Nancy and Olaf from the 2004-05 season. If a tropical cyclone leaves the basin and enter the Australian region, it will retain its original name. The names that will be used for the 2023–24 season are listed below.\n\nRetirement\nAfter the season, the names Lola and Mal were retired due to the damages they caused, and their replacements are Lute and Mata.\n\nSeason Effects\nThis table lists all the storms that developed in the South Pacific to the east of longitude 160°E during the 2023–24 season. It includes their intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, duration, name, landfalls, deaths, and damages. All data is taken from RSMC Nadi and/or TCWC Wellington, and all of the damage figures are in 2023 or 2024 USD.\n\nSee Also\nReferences\nExternal Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

He is best known for co-creating the FX horror-drama anthology series American Horror Story with Ryan Murphy, as well as for his work on other notable television shows such as Nip/Tuck, Glee, and Scream Queens.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBrad Falchuk was born in Massachusetts to Jewish parents. His mother, Nancy Falchuk, was the national president of the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America from 2007 to 2011. Falchuk attended high school, where he attempted to stand out from his classmates by wearing a tie to school each day. He was also an avid athlete, playing baseball, basketball, and lacrosse. However, despite his efforts to appear intelligent, Falchuk struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia. He eventually graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1993.\n\n**Career**\n\nFalchuk's career in television began as a writer for Mutant X (2001), Earth: Final Conflict (2001-02), and Veritas: The Quest (2003). He was hired to work on the first season of Nip/Tuck in 2003, where he formed a close bond and partnership with the show's creator, Ryan Murphy. Falchuk and Murphy went on to write a television pilot titled Pretty/Handsome, about a transgender gynecologist, which the FX network bought in 2008. However, the pilot was not picked up as a series. Falchuk's work on Nip/Tuck laid the groundwork for his future collaborations with Murphy.\n\n**Beginnings and Glee**\n\nFalchuk's career in television began as a writer for Mutant X (2001), Earth: Final Conflict (2001-02), and Veritas: The Quest (2003), before he was hired to work on the first season of Nip/Tuck in 2003. While working on Nip/Tuck, he formed a close bond and partnership with the show's creator, Ryan Murphy. Falchuk and Murphy went on to write a television pilot titled Pretty/Handsome, about a transgender gynecologist, which the FX network bought in 2008. However, the pilot was not picked up as a series.\n\nFalchuk's work on Nip/Tuck marked the beginning of his successful collaboration with Murphy, which would go on to produce some of the most iconic and critically acclaimed television shows of the 21st century. In 2009, Falchuk and Murphy created the musical comedy-drama Glee, which premiered on Fox and ran for six seasons. Glee became a cultural phenomenon, with its catchy musical numbers and memorable characters capturing the hearts of audiences around the world.\n\n**Anthology Series and Scream Queens**\n\nIn 2011, Falchuk co-created the FX horror-drama anthology series American Horror Story with previous collaborator Ryan Murphy. The first season, starring Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, and Dylan McDermott, premiered on October 5, 2011, and received critical acclaim. The series was nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards in 2012, and 15 Primetime Emmys in 2013, with Falchuk nominated for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie both years.\n\nIn 2014, the show was once again nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards, with Falchuk nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.

The show's success has cemented Falchuk and Murphy's reputation as two of the most innovative and successful television creators of our time.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1997, as a student at the American Film Institute, Falchuk co-founded the arts education nonprofit Young Storytellers with Mikkel Bondesen and Andrew Barrett, in response to cutbacks in funding for creative arts programs in Los Angeles Unified School District.

She has also gained attention for her affiliation with the Church of Scientology and her recent collaboration with the band Linkin Park.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEmily Armstrong was born in Los Angeles, California. Her parents were prominent members of the Church of Scientology, and she was raised as a Scientologist. Armstrong began writing songs and playing guitar at the age of 11 and started singing when she was 15. She dropped out of high school, citing her passion for music as her primary reason for leaving. In an interview, Armstrong stated that music was the one thing that kept her motivated in life.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 2002, Armstrong began playing with guitarist Siouxsie Medley, whom she met through a mutual friend. Both Medley and Armstrong shared similar tastes in music, drawing inspiration from Nirvana, L7, and 1960s and 1970s folk and blues artists, as well as classic rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell, and Fleetwood Mac. As a songwriter, Armstrong was significantly influenced by folk rock, incorporating open and alternate tunings, similar to those used by Mitchell, which resulted in Dead Sara's signature sound. As a performer, Armstrong was influenced by artists such as Iggy Pop and Janis Joplin.\n\n**Dead Sara**\n\nArmstrong's musical career began with Dead Sara, a rock band formed with guitarist Siouxsie Medley in 2002. The band's music style is characterized by Armstrong's powerful vocals and Medley's guitar work. Dead Sara's sound is a blend of alternative rock, hard rock, and folk rock, with lyrics that often focus on themes of love, heartbreak, and social commentary.\n\n**Linkin Park**\n\nOn September 5, 2024, at the start of a livestreamed Linkin Park concert, Armstrong was introduced as the band's new co-lead vocalist. The livestream included a performance of \"The Emptiness Machine,\" the lead single of the group's forthcoming album \"From Zero,\" which will be released on November 15, 2024.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nIn 2013, Armstrong was photographed attending the 44th Anniversary Gala of the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Centre International, where she was identified as one of several \"prominent members.\" Shortly after joining Linkin Park, Armstrong was the subject of media reports about her ties to the Church, sparking criticism from some of the band's fans. According to reports, several of Dead Sara's lyrics suggest criticism and rejection of Scientology's teachings.\n\n**Church of Scientology**\n\nArmstrong's affiliation with the Church of Scientology has been a subject of controversy, with some critics accusing the Church of being a cult. The Church has denied these allegations, stating that it is a legitimate spiritual organization. Armstrong has not publicly commented on her relationship with the Church, but her attendance at the 2013 gala and her subsequent involvement with Linkin Park have raised questions about her commitment to the Church's teachings.\n\n**Danny Masterson trial**\n\nIn September 2024, it was reported that Armstrong had attended a 2020 criminal hearing of former actor and convicted rapist Danny Masterson, a longtime Scientologist. One of Masterson's alleged victims, Chrissie Carnell-Bixler, and her spouse, Mars Volta and At the Drive-In singer and former Scientologist Cedric Bixler-Zavala, publicly criticized Armstrong's decision to attend the hearing during Masterson's trial. On September 6, Armstrong clarified that while she attended one court appearance in support of Masterson, whom she considered a friend at the time, she realized shortly afterward that she should not have done so and had not spoken to Masterson since. She stated that she does not condone abuse or violence against women and empathizes with Masterson's victims.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2016, Armstrong was in a relationship with model Kate Harrison.

{"title": "N._T._Rama_Rao", "content": "\nEarly life\nNandamuri Taraka Rama Rao was born on 28 May 1923 in a Telugu Hindu agrarian family [1] in Nimmakuru, a small village in Gudivada taluk of Krishna district, which was a part of the erstwhile Madras Presidency of British India He was given in adoption to his paternal uncle because his uncle and aunt were childless [25] He was first educated by a teacher who came from a nearby village, whom he would attribute his command of Telugu to, as well as his father, an aspiring thespian and patron of the arts Although children were normally pulled out of school after completing their primary education, on account of being the first male child in the family, his father sent him to Vijayawada, where he continued his education, matriculating in 1940 before studying at SRR & CVR College and completed a bachelor's degree from Andhra Christian College in Guntur  [26]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 1943, at the age of 20, while still pursuing his Intermediate, Rao married Smt Basava Rama Tarakam, the daughter of his maternal uncle The marriage resulted in twelve children; including eight sons and four daughters, namely: Ramakrishna Sr., Jayakrishna, Saikrishna, Harikrishna, Nandamuri Mohana Krishna, Balakrishna, Ramakrishna Jr., Jayashankarakrishna, Garapati Lokeswari (daughter), Daggubati Purandeswari (daughter), Nara Bhuvaneswari (daughter), and Kantamaneni Umamaheswari (daughter) [29]\n\n\nFilm career\nRama Rao started his film career with a walk-on role as a policeman in Mana Desam (1949) [11] Following this, he appeared in Palletoori Pilla (1950), directed by B A Subba Rao [45] His first religious film was in 1957, where he portrayed the Hindu god Krishna in the blockbuster film Maya Bazaar [46] He played Krishna in 17 films, [46] including some landmark films such as Sri Krishnarjuna Yudham (1962), the Tamil film Karnan (1964) and Daana Veera Soora Karna (1977) He was also known for his portrayal of the god Rama, essaying that role in films such as Lava Kusa (1963) and Sri Ramanjaneya Yuddham (1974) to name a few He has also portrayed other characters from the Ramayana, such as Ravana in Bhookailas (1958) and Seetharama Kalyanam (1961) among others He portrayed the god Vishnu in films such as Sri Venkateswara Mahatyam (1960) among others and the god Shiva in Dakshayagnam (1962) He has also enacted the roles of Mahabharata characters, such as Bheeshma, Arjuna, Karna and Duryodhana \n\n\nPolitical career\nNadendla Bhaskara Rao, a veteran politician joined Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founded by Rama Rao, on 29 March 1982 in Hyderabad He said that this decision was based on a historic need to rid Andhra Pradesh of the corrupt and inept rule of the Indian National Congress, which had governed the state since its formation in 1956 [50]\n\n\nFirst term as Chief Minister, 1983\nIn the elections, the TDP allied with the Sanjaya Vichara Manch party and decided to field educated candidates who had a good name in the society [citation needed] and were not indulging in corruption, which was an innovative political concept at the time Rao himself decided to contest from two assembly constituencies, Gudivada and Tirupati He used many innovative ways of campaigning, such as being the first politician in India to use rath yatras for campaigning For this, he used a modified Chevrolet van which was given the name of Chaitanya Ratham In this, Rao travelled across the state of Andhra Pradesh, crisscrossing all the districts With his son Nandamuri Harikrishna, also a film actor, driving the van, Rao notched up over 75,000 kilometers during his campaign, a distinctive sight with the van's yellow party flags and banners and Rao sitting on top of the vehicle hailing the crowds [51] He campaigned for restoring the dignity of the Telugu people and advocated forming a closer bond between the government and the common people, going into the elections with the slogan, Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam (lit Telugu people's self-respect) [52]\n\n\nLoss of power, 1984\nOn 15 August 1984, Rao was removed from office by the then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Thakur Ram Lal, while Rao was in the US to undergo open heart surgery [56] His finance minister, Nadendla Bhaskara Rao, a former Congressman, was made the Chief Minister by the Governor Thakur Ram Lal Bhaskar Rao purportedly had the support of majority of the TDP MLAs [citation needed]\n\n\nReturn to power, 1984\nRama Rao returned to India immediately after his surgery, disputed the claims by Bhaskara Rao and demonstrated his strength by bringing all the MLAs supporting him, which was a majority in the 294-member assembly, to the Raj Bhavan (Governor's Office) [56] Ramlal did not relent, as a result of which Rama Rao relaunched his Chaitanya Ratham campaign, this time campaigning for the restoration of democracy by mobilizing the support of people and various anti-Congress political parties in the country including the Janata Party (JP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the National Conference (NC) During the one-month crisis, the MLAs supporting Rama Rao were secured in a secret place to avoid horse-trading This was achieved with the support of Ramakrishna Hegde, Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde moved all the TDP MLAs to a Budget Hotel, Das Prakash, in Mysuru (Mysore), as Congress was known for poaching MLAs regularly and was felt necessitated This was the first time in Indian Politics that MLAs were secured at a safe place from poaching Also, due to mobilization of several political parties and the people and due to press, the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi unwillingly removed Governor Ramlal and appointed a Congress veteran, Shankar Dayal Sharma, as the governor of Andhra Pradesh to pave the way for restoring Rao [56]\n\n\nCampaigning in Tamil Nadu, 1984\nIn 1984, when the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and fellow senior actor M G Ramachandran (M.G.R.) was unable to campaign in the state assembly election due to him being hospitalized in the US, N.T.R., who was a close friend of M.G.R., [57] and R M Veerappan who was handling the party affairs, campaigned for the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) [citation needed] As leader of the National Front, he campaigned extensively for the constituent parties when they faced elections, again using his Chaitanya Ratham campaigning concept [58]\n\n\nGeneral elections, 1984\nA month later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated and was succeeded as prime minister by her son, Rajiv Gandhi In the ensuing national elections to the Lok Sabha, the Congress, riding on the sympathy wave caused by Gandhi's assassination, won convincingly all over the country except in Andhra Pradesh where the TDP secured a landslide victory TDP became the first regional party to serve as the main opposition party in the Lok Sabha [59]\n\n\nSecond term as Chief Minister, 1985\nMeanwhile, in the state, Rao recommended dissolution of the Assembly and called for fresh elections the following year in the state to ensure that the people had a fresh choice to elect their representatives The TDP again won with a massive majority in those elections, with Rao winning from 3 seats: Hindupur, [60] Nalgonda [61] and Gudivada, [62] thus marking the beginning of his second term as Chief Minister Senior Leaders of the Congress in the state including former Chief Ministers Kasu Brahmananda Reddy and Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy lost in their constituencies of Narasaraopet and Kurnool respectively to the TDP Rao completed his five-year term as Chief Minister [63]\n\n\nYears as opposition, 1989\nIn the December 1989 assembly elections however, he was voted out of power due to a wave of anti-incumbency sweeping the state as a result of which the Congress returned to power During this time, he suffered a mild stroke, as a result of which he was unable to campaign, which, according to some political analysts and TDP supporters, was the reason for the TDP's loss [citation needed]\n\n\nNational politics, 1989\nDuring 1989, he established himself in national politics, forming a coalition of non-Congress parties opposed to the Congress known as the National Front It included parties, besides the TDP, such as the Janata Dal and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) This alliance governed India between 1989 and 1990 with support from the BJP Meanwhile, Rao assumed the position as the Leader of Opposition in the state His National Front government at the national level led by V P Singh was at the forefront of social justice by implementing the provisions in the Mandal Commission for providing 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC's) [citation needed]\n\n\nThird term as Chief Minister, 1994\nRao returned to power for a third and final time in the December 1994 state assembly elections with his party in alliance with the Left Front This alliance won 269 seats in the 294 seat Assembly, with the TDP alone winning 226 The Congress, which once again had multiple Chief Ministers in the state during its five-year rule between 1989 and 1994, won only 26 seats Rao contested again from Hindupur and won the seat for the third consecutive time, [60] achieving a rare hat-trick of wins from the same assembly constituency He also won from another assembly constituency, Tekkali [64] In 1995, TDP leaders unhappy with Lakshmi Parvati NTR wife interring in politics, led a revolt in the party against Rao, which led to N Chandrababu Naidu becoming the CM on 1 September 1995 replacing Rao [65] The internal rebellion was triggered by the controversial role of Lakshmi Parvathi, NTR's second wife, in the party and the government [66] Naidu was able to secure the support of the majority of the legislators  Following this, NTR vowed to take revenge against Naidu in an interview with Reuters [67] However, NTR died in 1996 His second wife, Lakshmi Parvathi led NTR Telugu Desam Party which was eventually closed and joined INC, later YSRCP.\n\n\nAwards and honors\nThe NTR National Award is a national award in honour of Rao It was instituted in 1996 by the Government of Andhra Pradesh to recognise notable film

Rao's early life was marked by his adoption by his paternal uncle, who was childless at the time.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nIn 1923, Rao was born to a Telugu Hindu agrarian family in Nimmakuru, a small village in Gudivada taluk of Krishna district. His family was known for their modest means, and Rao's father, Nandamuri Lakshminarayana, was a struggling farmer. The family was forced to relocate to a nearby village, where Rao spent most of his childhood. Despite the challenges faced by the family, Rao's father encouraged his love for the arts, particularly music and dance.\n\nRao's early education was provided by a local teacher from a nearby village. This teacher played a significant role in shaping Rao's love for Telugu language and literature. Rao's father also contributed to his education, sending him to Vijayawada, where he matriculated in 1940. Rao then pursued his higher education at SRR & CVR College and later graduated from Andhra Christian College in Guntur.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1943, at the age of 20, Rao married Basava Rama Tarakam, the daughter of his maternal uncle. The marriage resulted in 12 children, including eight sons and four daughters. Rao's family life was marked by his strong commitment to his children's education and upbringing. He believed in the importance of family values and often incorporated these values in his film roles and public life.\n\n**Film Career**\n\nRao's film career began with a walk-on role in the 1949 film \"Mana Desam.\" He then appeared in \"Palletoori Pilla\" (1950), directed by B. A. Subba Rao. Rao's first religious film was \"Maya Bazaar\" (1957), where he portrayed the Hindu god Krishna. He played Krishna in 17 films, including some landmark films such as \"Sri Krishnarjuna Yudham\" (1962), \"Karnan\" (1964), and \"Daana Veera Soora Karna\" (1977). Rao was also known for his portrayal of the god Rama in films such as \"Lava Kusa\" (1963) and \"Sri Ramanjaneya Yuddham\" (1974).\n\nRao's film career spanned over four decades, during which he appeared in over 100 films. He was known for his versatility and range as an actor, and his performances in both mythological and commercial films earned him widespread recognition.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nRao joined the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1982, founded by himself. He was a key figure in the party's early years, and his leadership played a significant role in the party's success. Rao was elected as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1983, a position he held until 1984. During his tenure, he implemented several innovative policies, including the use of Rath Yatras for campaigning.\n\nRao's tenure as Chief Minister was marked by his commitment to social justice and his efforts to promote the dignity of the Telugu people. He advocated for a closer bond between the government and the common people, and his slogan, \"Telugu Vari Atma Gauravam,\" reflected his vision for a more inclusive and equal society.\n\n**First Term as Chief Minister (1983)**\n\nRao's first term as Chief Minister was marked by his innovative approach to politics. He used the Rath Yatras, a modified Chevrolet van, to campaign across the state. The van was given the name \"Chaitanya Ratham,\" and it became a symbol of Rao's commitment to the people of Andhra Pradesh. Rao campaigned extensively, traveling over 75,000 kilometers during his campaign. His efforts earned him widespread support, and he was able to mobilize the support of the people and various anti-Congress political parties in the country.\n\n**Loss of Power (1984)**\n\nRao was removed from office by the Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Thakur Ram Lal, on August 15, 1984. Rao was in the US at the time, undergoing open-heart surgery. His finance minister, Nadendla Bhaskara Rao, a former Congressman, was made the Chief Minister by the Governor. Rao disputed the claims by Bhaskara Rao and demonstrated his strength by bringing all the MLAs supporting him to the Raj Bhavan.\n\n**Return to Power (1984)**\n\nRao returned to India immediately after his surgery and relaunched his Chaitanya Ratham campaign. He mobilized the support of the people and various anti-Congress political parties in the country. The crisis lasted for a month, during which the MLAs supporting Rao were secured in a secret place to avoid horse-trading. Ramakrishna Hegde, the Chief Minister of Karnataka, moved the TDP MLAs to a Budget Hotel in Mysuru. The mobilization of several political parties and the people, as well as the press, eventually led to the removal of Governor Ramlal and the appointment of a new Governor, Shankar Dayal Sharma.\n\n**Campaigning in Tamil Nadu (1984)**\n\nIn 1984, when the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran, was unable to campaign in the state assembly election due to his hospitalization in the US, Rao, a close friend of Ramachandran, campaigned for the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Rao used his Chaitanya Ratham concept to campaign extensively for the constituent parties of the National Front.\n\n**General Elections (1984)**\n\nA month later, Indira Gandhi was assassinated, and her son, Rajiv Gandhi, succeeded her as Prime Minister. The national elections to the Lok Sabha were held, and the Congress, riding on the sympathy wave caused by Gandhi's assassination, won convincingly all over the country except in Andhra Pradesh, where the TDP secured a landslide victory.\n\n**Second Term as Chief Minister (1985)**\n\nRao recommended the dissolution of the Assembly and called for fresh elections the following year. The TDP won with a massive majority in those elections, with Rao winning from three seats: Hindupur, Nalgonda, and Gudivada. This marked the beginning of his second term as Chief Minister.\n\n**Years as Opposition (1989)**\n\nIn the December 1989 assembly elections, Rao was voted out of power due to a wave of anti-incumbency sweeping the state. The Congress returned to power, and Rao suffered a mild stroke, which he claimed was the reason for the TDP's loss.\n\n**National Politics (1989)**\n\nRao established himself in national politics, forming a coalition of non-Congress parties opposed to the Congress known as the National Front. The alliance included parties such as the Janata Dal and the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). This alliance governed India between 1989 and 1990 with the support of the BJP. Rao assumed the position as the Leader of Opposition in the state.\n\n**Third Term as Chief Minister (1994)**\n\nRao returned to power for a third and final time in the December 1994 state assembly elections. The TDP, in alliance with the Left Front, won 269 seats in the 294-seat Assembly. Rao contested from Hindupur and Tekkali and won both seats.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRao's legacy is marked by his commitment to social justice and his efforts to promote the dignity of the Telugu people. His innovative approach to politics, including the use of Rath Yatras, has been emulated by several politicians in India. Rao's film career, spanning over four decades, earned him widespread recognition, and his performances in both mythological and commercial films remain iconic to this day.\n\n**Electoral Performance**\n\nRao died of a heart attack on January 18, 1996, at the age of 72. He was cremated, and his ashes were immersed at Srirangapatna by his second wife, Lakshmi Parvathi, eight years later, in May 2004.\n\n**Institutions and Other Establishments Founded by Late Sri. Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao**\n\nRao founded several institutions and establishments during his lifetime, including the Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences, which was established as the University of Health Sciences by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and was renamed in his honor after his death.\n\n**Portrayals**\n\nRao has been portrayed in several films and television shows, including a biopic

achieved with the support of Ramakrishna Hegde, Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde moved all the TDP MLAs to a Budget Hotel, Das Prakash, in Mysuru (Mysore), as Congress was known for poaching MLAs regularly and was felt necessitated This was the first time in Indian Politics that MLAs were secured at a safe place from poaching Also, due to mobilization of several political parties and the people and due to press, the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi unwillingly removed Governor Ramlal and appointed a Congress veteran, Shankar Dayal Sharma, as the governor of Andhra Pradesh to pave the way for restoring Rao [56]\n\n\nCampaigning in Tamil Nadu, 1984\nIn 1984, when the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and fellow senior actor M G Ramachandran (M.G.R.) was unable to campaign in the

Lakshmi Parvati NTR wife interring in politics, led a revolt in the party against Rao, which led to N Chandrababu Naidu becoming the CM on 1 September 1995 replacing Rao [65] The internal rebellion

Born in Paris, Rau has been open about her experiences as a transgender woman and has used her platform to advocate for transgender rights and visibility.\n\nEarly Life\n---------\n\nRau was born to a French-North African family in Paris. Her early life was marked by a sense of identity that did not align with societal expectations. As she grew older, Rau began to explore her gender identity, eventually coming out as a trans woman at the age of 16. Her decision to transition was partly inspired by the life story of British model Caroline \"Tula\" Cossey, who had also transitioned and become a prominent figure in the fashion industry.\n\nRau's transition was a significant turning point in her life, allowing her to express herself authentically and pursue her passions without fear of judgment. At the age of 16, she underwent gender-affirming surgery, which marked the beginning of her journey as a confident and self-assured trans woman.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\nAfter turning 18, Rau began to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, initially working as a dancer for DJs in Ibiza. It was during this time that she met French DJ and producer David Guetta, with whom she became close friends. Guetta has since become a vocal supporter of Rau's work and has credited her with helping to promote acceptance and understanding of transgender individuals.\n\nIn 2013, at the age of 23, Rau made her modeling debut in a spread for the French luxury magazine OOB, posing nude alongside American model Tyson Beckford. This marked a significant milestone in her career, as it was one of her first public appearances as a trans woman. Her decision to pose nude was a bold statement, highlighting her confidence and self-assurance as a trans woman.\n\nJust a year later, in 2014, Rau appeared in Playboy's \"A-Z issue,\" a special edition that aimed to showcase the diversity of human experience. Her spread, titled \"Evolution,\" was a powerful statement about the growing acceptance of gender identities beyond the male-female binary. Rau's appearance in Playboy marked a significant moment in the history of the magazine, as she became the second trans woman to be featured, after Caroline \"Tula\" Cossey in 1981.\n\nRau's relationship with French footballer Kylian Mbappé has also been widely reported, with the two being spotted together on several occasions. While the nature of their relationship has not been publicly confirmed, their association has helped to raise Rau's profile and increase her visibility in the media.\n\nActivism\n--------\n\nFollowing her coming-out, Rau became increasingly active in advocating for transgender rights. In 2016, she appeared on the French news format Sept à Huit, an episode focused on her life and experiences as a trans woman. Her appearance on the show helped to raise awareness and promote understanding of transgender issues, highlighting the importance of acceptance and inclusivity.\n\nRau's activism extends beyond her own experiences, with a focus on promoting visibility and acceptance for all transgender individuals. Through her work, she aims to challenge societal norms and promote a more inclusive and accepting environment for trans people.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nInes Rau is a talented model, dancer, and activist who has made a significant impact in the fashion and entertainment industries. Her courage and confidence in the face of adversity have inspired countless others, highlighting the importance of acceptance and inclusivity. Through her activism, Rau continues to promote understanding and visibility for transgender individuals, helping to create a more inclusive and accepting world for all.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ines_Rau\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRau was born in Paris and is of French-North African descent [1] [11]Rau transitioned and underwent gender-affirming surgery at the age of 16, after being inspired by the life story of English trans model Caroline \"Tula\" Cossey [1] [11]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter turning 18, Rau started dancing for DJs in Ibiza, during which she became friends with David Guetta [12] [13] In 2013, at age 23, she first posed nude with Tyson Beckford for a spread in OOB, a French luxury magazine, shortly after coming out as transgender [14] In May 2014, she first appeared in Playboy's \"A-Z issue\" in a spread titled \"Evolution\" that aimed to depict the growing acceptance of gender identities beyond the male-female binary [15] She became the second transgender woman to be featured in Playboy after Cossey in 1981 and the first who came out voluntarily (Cossey was outed against her will and reappeared in the magazine in 1991) She has also been in a relationship with French footballer Kylian Mbappé [9] [16] [17] [18]\n\n\nActivism\nFollowing her coming-out, Rau became more active campaigning for transgender rights In 2016, she appeared on the TF1 news format Sept à Huit on an episode focused on her life [20]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Walter_Mondale", "content": "\nEarly life\nWalter Frederick Mondale was born on January 5, 1928, in Ceylon, Minnesota, [4] to Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a Methodist minister, and Claribel Hope (née Cowan), a part-time music teacher [5] [6] Walter's half-brother Lester Mondale became a Unitarian minister [7] Mondale also has two brothers, Clarence, known as Pete (1926–2014), and William, known as Mort His paternal grandparents were Norwegian immigrants, with some distant German ancestry [8] Mondale's paternal grandfather Frederik Mundal had emigrated from Norway with his family in 1856, eventually settling in southern Minnesota in 1864 [9] The surname Mondale derives from that of Mundal, a valley and town in the Fjærland region of Norway [10] His mother was born in Iowa, the daughter of an immigrant father, Robert Cowan, who was born in Seaforth, Ontario; she was of Scottish and English descent [11]\n\n\nEntry into politics\nMondale became involved in national politics in the 1940s At age 20, he was visible in Minnesota politics by helping organize Hubert Humphrey's successful Senate campaign in 1948 Humphrey's campaign assigned Mondale to cover the staunchly Republican 2nd district Mondale, who had grown up in the region, was able to win the district for Humphrey by a comfortable margin [20]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1964–1976)\nOn December 30, 1964, Minnesota Governor Karl Rolvaag appointed Mondale to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by Hubert Humphrey's resignation; Humphrey had stepped down after being elected vice president of the United States Mondale was elected to the Senate for the first time in 1966, defeating Republican candidate Robert A Forsythe by a margin of 53.9% to 45.2% [26]\n\n\nPolicies\nMondale worked hard to build up the center of the party on economic and social issues Unlike his father, a fervent liberal, he was not a crusader for the New Deal Instead, he realized that the Democratic base (especially ethnic blue-collar workers) was gradually moving to the right, and he worked to keep their support [31] Mondale showed little or no interest in foreign policy until about 1974, when he realized that some foreign policy knowledge was necessary if he had loftier aspirations than the Senate He developed a centrist position, avoiding alignment with either the party's hawks (such as Henry M Jackson) or its doves (such as McGovern) [32] Mondale took a liberal position on civil rights, which proved acceptable in Minnesota, a state with \"a minuscule black population\" [33] Mondale was a chief sponsor of the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing and created the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity as the primary enforcer of the law [34]\n\n\nCommittees\nMondale rotated on and off numerous committees, including the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee; the Finance Committee; the Labor and Public Welfare Committee; the Budget Committee; and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee He also served as chairman of the Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunity and the Intelligence Committee's Domestic Task Force He additionally served as chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee's subcommittee on Children and Youth and the Senate subcommittee on social security financing [37]\n\n\nApollo 1 accident (1967)\nIn 1967, Mondale served on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, then chaired by Clinton P Anderson, when astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire on January 27 while testing the Apollo 204 (later renumbered Apollo 1) spacecraft NASA Administrator James E Webb secured

prominent American politician who served as the 42nd Vice President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was a key figure in the Democratic Party and played a significant role in shaping the country's politics during the 1970s and 1980s. Mondale was a dedicated public servant, serving in various capacities, including the United States Senate, the Vice Presidency, and as the United States Ambassador to Japan.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nWalter Mondale was born on January 5, 1928, in Ceylon, Minnesota, to Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a Methodist minister, and Claribel Hope (née Cowan), a part-time music teacher. His half-brother Lester Mondale became a Unitarian minister, and Mondale also has two brothers, Clarence, known as Pete, and William, known as Mort. Mondale's paternal grandparents were Norwegian immigrants, with some distant German ancestry, and his surname Mondale derives from the name of Mundal, a valley and town in the Fjærland region of Norway.\n\n**Entry into Politics**\n\nMondale became involved in national politics in the 1940s. At the age of 20, he was visible in Minnesota politics by helping organize Hubert Humphrey's successful Senate campaign in 1948. Humphrey's campaign assigned Mondale to cover the staunchly Republican 2nd district, and Mondale, who had grown up in the region, was able to win the district for Humphrey by a comfortable margin.\n\n**U.S. Senate (1964–1976)**\n\nOn December 30, 1964, Minnesota Governor Karl Rolvaag appointed Mondale to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy created by Hubert Humphrey's resignation. Mondale was elected to the Senate for the first time in 1966, defeating Republican candidate Robert A. Forsythe by a margin of 53.9% to 45.2%. During his time in the Senate, Mondale worked hard to build up the center of the party on economic and social issues. He took a liberal position on civil rights, which proved acceptable in Minnesota, a state with a minuscule black population. Mondale was a chief sponsor of the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing and created the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity as the primary enforcer of the law.\n\n**Policies**\n\nMondale worked to keep the support of the Democratic base, especially ethnic blue-collar workers, by not being a crusader for the New Deal. He showed little or no interest in foreign policy until about 1974, when he realized that some foreign policy knowledge was necessary if he had loftier aspirations than the Senate. Mondale developed a centrist position, avoiding alignment with either the party's hawks or its doves.\n\n**Committees**\n\nMondale rotated on and off numerous committees, including the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, the Finance Committee, the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. He also served as chairman of the Select Committee on Equal Education Opportunity and the Intelligence Committee's Domestic Task Force. Additionally, Mondale served as chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee's subcommittee on Children and Youth and the Senate subcommittee on social security financing.\n\n**Apollo 1 Accident (1967)**\n\nIn 1967, Mondale served on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, then chaired by Clinton P. Anderson, when astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire on January 27 while testing the Apollo 204 (later renumbered Apollo 1) spacecraft. NASA Administrator James E. Webb secured President Lyndon Johnson's approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight.\n\n**Vice Presidency (1977–1981)**\n\nWhen Jimmy Carter won the Democratic nomination for president in 1976, he chose Mondale as his running mate. Mondale campaigned for the ticket in various states, and the ticket was narrowly elected on November 2, 1976. Mondale was inaugurated as Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1977, and he also became the first vice president to live at Number One Observatory Circle.\n\n**1980 Election**\n\nCarter and Mondale were renominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. That year, Mondale opened the XIII Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid, New York.\n\n**Post-Vice Presidency (1981–2021)**\n\nAfter losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at Winston and Strawn, a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long. Mondale returned to private law practice with Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was United States Ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study campaign finance reform, and was Clinton's special envoy to Indonesia in 1998.\n\n**2002 U.S. Senate Election and Beyond**\n\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a plane crash 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become vice president in 1977.\n\n**Family and Personal Life**\n\nMondale's wife, Joan Mondale, was a national advocate for the arts and was the Honorary Chairman of the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities during the Carter Administration. On February 3, 2014, she died at a hospice in Minneapolis surrounded by family members.\n\n**Death**\n\nWalter Mondale passed away on April 19, 2021, at the age of 93, after a long illness. His death was announced by his family, and he was remembered as a dedicated public servant who had a long and distinguished career in politics.\n\n**Electoral History**\n\nIn the \"Walter F.

{"title": "Public_Investment_Fund", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) was established by the King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in 1971 [9] by Royal Decree M/24 [10] with the stated intent to provide financing support for projects of strategic significance to the national economy [11] For much of its history, the PIF was a passive entity that oversaw the Saudi state's equity in listed firms When neighboring petrostates began using their sovereign wealth funds for influence, Saudi Arabia followed them The PIF expanded its staff from 50 in 2015 to nearly 500 in 2018 [9]\n\n\nInvestment projects\nThe PIF has 38% stake in Posco Engineering & Construction Co., a 5% stake in Uber (for $3.5 billion), and a 5% stake in the video game companies Capcom and Nexon (for $1 billion) [19] In March 2016, it was announced that ownership of Saudi Aramco would be transferred to the PIF and that the Kingdom will seek to list 5 percent of Aramco's shares by 2017 [20] PIF owns Qiddiya, [21] spearheads the Red Sea Project for luxury beach resorts, [22] [23] and owns the closed joint-stock company named Neom [24] [25] PIF owns a 5.7% stake (valued at $500 million) in concert distributor Live Nation [26] In 2020, PIF purchased minority stakes in major U.S companies including Boeing, Meta Platforms (then Facebook) and Citigroup [27] PIF disclosed a $713.7 million stake in Boeing, around $522 million in Citigroup, a $522 million stake in Facebook, a $495.8 million stake in Disney and a $487.6 million stake in Bank of America It also disclosed a small stake in Berkshire Hathaway [28] PIF also disclosed an $827.7 million stake in oil company BP [29] In 2020, PIF purchased a 2.32% stake (valued at $1.5 billion) in India's Jio Platforms, [30] [31] and reduced its holdings in US stocks to $7 billion from $10.1 billion in the third quarter It instead left a stake of $2.7 billion in Uber [32]\n\n\nFormer Donald Trump administration officials\nIn 2021 PIF invested $2 billion into a private equity firm that had been newly formed by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, shortly after he left the White House PIF advisers raised questions about the merits of the investment, but PIF management overruled the advisers [4] By April 2022, Kushner's equity firm primarily depended on Saudi money, as it only had $2.5 billion under its management [4] Within the Donald Trump administration, Kushner was a staunch defender of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman [4] According to ethics experts, the investment created the appearance of potential payback for Kushner [4]\n\n\nTakeover of Newcastle United\nOn 14 April 2020 it emerged that a deal to transfer ownership of Newcastle United F.C for £300m had been agreed between incumbent owner Mike Ashley and a prospective buying consortium consisting of the Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and Reuben Brothers [54] However, the Premier League controversially refused to ratify the deal and so Mike Ashley subsequently engaged in various legal proceedings against the Premier League in an attempt to complete the takeover [55] [56] On 7 October 2021, it was announced that the club would be acquired by the consortium led by the Public Investment Fund, [57] after the Premier League stated it had received \"legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club\" [58]\n\n\nEstablishment of LIV Golf\nIn October 2021 a division of the PIF, Golf Saudi funded the establishment of LIV Golf Investments, with Greg Norman declared to be its CEO The private company introduced a professional tour, LIV Golf, also referred to beforehand as the Super Golf League It came as a new challenge against the PGA Tour, after the World Golf Tour and the Premier Golf League [65] [66] [67] [68]\n\n\nExposure to Credit Suisse crisis\nIn 2022 PIF made a $1.5 billion investment in Credit Suisse as part of a broader goal of diversifying its portfolio into global banking The PIF connected Credit Suisse to the Saudi National Bank, and made the Saudi National Bank the largest shareholder with less than 10% ownership (which, according to the Saudi National Bank, prevented them from having to deal with regulatory requirements for 10%+ shareholder ownership) [83] After the March 2023 United States bank failures had gripped the global banking sector, Saudi National Bank chairman Ammar al-Khudair publicly stated on 15 March 2023 that they would \"absolutely not\" supply Credit Suisse with more capital (referencing the regulatory requirements for 10%+ shareholders as the reason why), which then promptly caused the share price of Credit Suisse to drop 25% more On 19 March 2023, UBS confirmed their planned acquisition of Credit Suisse [84]\n\n\nATP and WTA Tour Partnership\nIn 2024 the Public Investment Fund announced partnerships with the ATP and WTA tours [85] [86]\n\n\nPartnership with Central Group\nOn 7 October 2024, PIF announced a strategic partnership with Central Group Through this alliance, PIF acquired a 40% stake in Selfridges Group, following a binding agreement to acquire Signa Holding’s stake in Selfridges, pending regulatory approvals In this arrangement, PIF held 40% of both Selfridges Group's operating and property companies, while Central Group owned the remaining 60% This partnership aligned with PIF's strategy to invest in key sectors globally and aimed to unlock additional value for Selfridges By leveraging PIF's investment capabilities alongside Central Group’s industry expertise, the collaboration sought to accelerate Selfridges' growth, reinforcing its status in European luxury retail [88]\n\n\nList of investments\nThe following lists contain all the investments of the PIF as of April 2024: [89]\n\n\nGiga-projects\nPIF has been characterized as among the least transparent sovereign wealth funds in the world In 2016, The Wall Street Journal noted that none of the

sometimes other government ministries.\" [9] As the PIF is a ministry-operated company with an overwhelming focus on domestic investments, some scholars characterize it as a \"quasi-sovereign wealth

Its history, investments, and partnerships have raised both praise and criticism, highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Public_Investment_Fund\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) was established by the King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in 1971 [9] by Royal Decree M/24 [10] with the stated intent to provide financing support for projects of strategic significance to the national economy [11] For much of its history, the PIF was a passive entity that oversaw the Saudi state's equity in listed firms When neighboring petrostates began using their sovereign wealth funds for influence, Saudi Arabia followed them The PIF expanded its staff from 50 in 2015 to nearly 500 in 2018 [9]\n\n\nInvestment projects\nThe PIF has 38% stake in Posco Engineering & Construction Co., a 5% stake in Uber (for $3.5 billion), and a 5% stake in the video game companies Capcom and Nexon (for $1 billion) [19] In March 2016, it was announced that ownership of Saudi Aramco would be transferred to the PIF and that the Kingdom will seek to list 5 percent of Aramco's shares by 2017 [20] PIF owns Qiddiya, [21] spearheads the Red Sea Project for luxury beach resorts, [22] [23] and owns the closed joint-stock company named Neom [24] [25] PIF owns a 5.7% stake (valued at $500 million) in concert distributor Live Nation [26] In 2020, PIF purchased minority stakes in major U.S companies including Boeing, Meta Platforms (then Facebook) and Citigroup [27] PIF disclosed a $713.7 million stake in Boeing, around $522 million in Citigroup, a $522 million stake in Facebook, a $495.8 million stake in Disney and a $487.6 million stake in Bank of America It also disclosed a small stake in Berkshire Hathaway [28] PIF also disclosed an $827.7 million stake in oil company BP [29] In 2020, PIF purchased a 2.32% stake (valued at $1.5 billion) in India's Jio Platforms, [30] [31] and reduced its holdings in US stocks to $7 billion from $10.1 billion in the third quarter It instead left a stake of $2.7 billion in Uber [32]\n\n\nFormer Donald Trump administration officials\nIn 2021 PIF invested $2 billion into a private equity firm that had been newly formed by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, shortly after he left the White House PIF advisers raised questions about the merits of the investment, but PIF management overruled the advisers [4] By April 2022, Kushner's equity firm primarily depended on Saudi money, as it only had $2.5 billion under its management [4] Within the Donald Trump administration, Kushner was a staunch defender of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman [4] According to ethics experts, the investment created the appearance of potential payback for Kushner [4]\n\n\nTakeover of Newcastle United\nOn 14 April 2020 it emerged that a deal to transfer ownership of Newcastle United F.C for £300m had been agreed between incumbent owner Mike Ashley and a prospective buying consortium consisting of the Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and Reuben Brothers [54] However, the Premier League controversially refused to ratify the deal and so Mike Ashley subsequently engaged in various legal proceedings against the Premier League in an attempt to complete the takeover [55] [56] On 7 October 2021, it was announced that the club would be acquired by the consortium led by the Public Investment Fund, [57] after the Premier League stated it had received \"legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club\" [58]\n\n\nEstablishment of LIV Golf\nIn October 2021 a division of the PIF, Golf Saudi funded the establishment of LIV Golf Investments, with Greg Norman declared to be its CEO The private company introduced a professional tour, LIV Golf, also referred to beforehand as the Super Golf League It came as a new challenge against the PGA Tour, after the World Golf Tour and the Premier Golf League [65] [66] [67] [68]\n\n\nExposure to Credit Suisse crisis\nIn 2022 PIF made a $1.5 billion investment in Credit Suisse as part of a broader goal of diversifying its portfolio into global banking The PIF connected Credit Suisse to the Saudi National Bank, and made the Saudi National Bank the largest shareholder with less than 10% ownership (which, according to the Saudi National Bank, prevented them from having to deal with regulatory requirements for 10%+ shareholder ownership) [83] After the March 2023 United States bank failures had gripped the global banking sector, Saudi National Bank chairman Ammar al-Khudair publicly stated on 15 March 2023 that they would \"absolutely not\" supply Credit Suisse with more capital (referencing the regulatory requirements for 10%+ shareholders as the reason why), which then promptly caused the share price of Credit Suisse to drop 25% more On 19 March 2023, UBS confirmed their planned acquisition of Credit Suisse [84]\n\n\nATP and WTA Tour Partnership\nIn 2024 the Public Investment Fund announced partnerships with the ATP and WTA tours [85] [86]\n\n\nPartnership with Central Group\nOn 7 October 2024, PIF announced a strategic partnership with Central Group Through this alliance, PIF acquired a 40% stake in Selfridges Group, following a binding agreement to acquire Signa Holding’s stake in Selfridges, pending regulatory approvals In this arrangement, PIF held 40% of both Selfridges Group's operating and property companies, while Central Group owned the remaining 60% This partnership aligned with PIF's strategy to invest in key sectors globally and aimed to unlock additional value for Selfridges By leveraging PIF's investment capabilities alongside Central Group’s industry expertise, the collaboration sought to accelerate Selfridges' growth, reinforcing its status in European luxury retail [88]\n\n\nList of investments\nThe following lists contain all

target was a game at the Stade de France, controversies about the safety of players and tourists during the upcoming tournament arose Noël Le Graët, president of the French Football Federation, explained that the concern for security had increased following the attacks He claimed: \"there was already a concern for the Euros, now it's obviously a lot higher We will continue to do everything we can so that security is assured despite all the risks that this entails I know that everyone is vigilant Obviously, this means that we will now be even more vigilant But it's a permanent concern

events may have also been a contributor [135] [136]\n\n\nMoths\nBefore the final match started, the stadium was invaded by Silver Y moths, which caused some irritation to the players, staff and

during the warm-up tried swatting the moths, and ground staff used brushes to clean moths from the walls, ground and other places [147] [148] One moth was infamously captured flying on and around

other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015 [34] [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nVenues\nTen stadiums were used for the competition Initially, twelve stadiums were presented for the French bid, chosen on 28 May 2010 These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used [38] [39] The French Football Federation had to decide which nine would be

staged away from their bases From an initial list of 66 bases, the 24 participating teams had to confirm their selection with UEFA by 31 January 2016 [45]\n\n\nFinals format\nTo accommodate the expansion from a 16-team finals tournament to 24 teams, the format was changed from the one used in 2012 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout stage The six groups (A to F) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout stage In the new format, however, the four best third-ranked sides also progressed, leaving 16 teams going into the new round of 16 knockout stage (ahead of the usual quarter-finals, semi-finals and final), and only eight teams going out after the group stage [17]

€27 million (for winning all group matches and the final) [117]\n\n\nDiscipline\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences: [16]\n\n\nIssues\nPre-tournament concerns included heavy flooding of the River Seine in Paris, [119] and strikes in the transport sector shortly before the beginning of the event [120]\n\n\nSecurity\nFollowing the attacks on Paris on 13 November 2015, including one in which the intended target was a game at the Stade de France, controversies about the safety of players and tourists during the upcoming tournament arose Noël Le Graët, president of the French Football Federation, explained that the concern for security had increased following the attacks He claimed: \"there was already a concern for the Euros, now it's obviously a lot higher We will continue to do everything we can so that security is assured despite all the risks that this entails I know that everyone is vigilant Obviously, this means that we will now be even more vigilant But it's a permanent concern for the federation and the  [French] state\" [121]\n\n\nHooliganism\nThe day before the tournament, fighting broke out between local youths and

stadiums were criticised during the group stage for their poor quality France coach Didier Deschamps was especially critical [133] [134] UEFA tournament director Martin Kallen blamed heavy rain for damaged turf, though the press speculated that non-football events may have also been a contributor [135] [136]\n\n\nMoths\nBefore the final match started, the stadium was invaded by Silver Y moths, which caused some irritation to the players, staff and coaches The reason this occurred is because the workers at the stadium left the lights switched on the day before the match which attracted huge swaths of insects The players and coaches of each team during the warm-up tried swatting the moths, and ground staff used brushes to clean moths from the walls, ground and other places [147] [148] One moth was infamously captured flying on and around Cristiano Ronaldo's face when he was sitting on the pitch after being injured during the match [149]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe UEFA Euro 2016 video game was

From the early days of static web pages to the dynamic, user-generated content of Web 2.0, the web has evolved into a vast and complex network of interconnected services and platforms. The latest iteration, often referred to as Web3, promises to take the web to a new level of decentralization, security, and innovation. However, the concept of Web3 is still shrouded in mystery, and its true potential is yet to be fully realized.\n\n**Background**\n\nWeb 1.0 and Web 2.0 refer to eras in the history of the World Wide Web as it evolved through various technologies and formats.

Web 2.0, on the other hand, is based around the idea of \"the web as platform\" and centers on user-created content uploaded to forums, social media, and networking services, blogs, and wikis, among other services. Web 2.0 is generally considered to have begun around 2004 and continues to the current day.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nWeb3 is distinct from Tim Berners-Lee's 1999 concept of a Semantic Web, which was also sometimes referred to as Web 3.0.

list of powers Congress does not have, and Section Ten enumerates powers of the state, some of which may only be granted by Congress [83] Constitutional amendments have granted Congress additional powers Congress also has implied powers derived from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause.\n\n\nHistory\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies [14] On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, referring to the new nation as the \"United States of America\" The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created the Congress of the Confederation, a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions Congress had executive but not legislative authority, and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty [15] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws [16] [17]\n\n\n18th century\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies [14] On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, referring to

which each state had a veto over most decisions Congress had executive but not legislative authority, and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty [15] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws [16] [17]\n\n\n19th century\nIn 1800, Thomas Jefferson's election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties John Marshall, 4th chief justice of the Supreme Court, empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case Marbury v Madison in 1803, effectively giving the Supreme Court a power to nullify congressional legislation [29] [30]\n\n\n20th century\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, party structures and leadership emerged as key organizers of Senate proceedings [34]\n\n\n21st century\nIn 2009, Congress authorized another delegate for the Northern Mariana Islands These six members of Congress enjoy floor privileges to introduce bills and resolutions, and in recent Congresses they vote in permanent and select committees, in party caucuses and in joint conferences with the Senate They have Capitol Hill offices, staff and two annual appointments to each of the four military academies While their votes are constitutional when Congress authorizes their House Committee of the Whole votes, recent Congresses have not allowed for that, and they cannot vote when the House is meeting as the House of Representatives [75]\n\n\nWomen in Congress\nVarious social and structural barriers have prevented women from gaining seats in Congress In the early 20th century, women's domestic roles and the inability to vote forestalled opportunities to run for and hold public office The two party system and the lack of term limits favored incumbent white men, making the widow's succession – in which a woman temporarily took over a seat vacated by the death of her husband – the most common path to Congress for white women [77]\n\n\nRole\nArticle One of the Constitution creates and sets forth the structure and most of the powers of Congress Sections One through Six describe how Congress is elected and gives each House the power to create its own

amendments have granted Congress additional powers Congress also has implied powers derived from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause.\n\n\nEnumeration\nThe Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress in detail In addition, other congressional powers have been granted, or confirmed, by constitutional amendments The Thirteenth (1865), Fourteenth (1868), and Fifteenth Amendments (1870) gave Congress authority to enact legislation to enforce rights of African Americans, including voting rights, due process, and equal protection under the law [107] Generally militia forces are controlled by state governments, not Congress [108]\n\n\nImplicit, commerce clause\nCongress also has implied powers deriving from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause which permit Congress to \"make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof\" [109] Broad interpretations of this clause and of the Commerce Clause, the enumerated power to regulate commerce, in rulings such as McCulloch v Maryland, have effectively widened the scope of Congress's legislative authority far beyond that prescribed in Section Eight [110] [111]\n\n\nTerritorial government\nConstitutional responsibility for the oversight of Washington, D.C., the federal district and national capital, and the U.S territories of Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands rests with Congress [112] The republican form of government in territories is devolved by congressional statute to the respective territories including direct election of governors, the D.C mayor and locally elective territorial legislatures [113]\n\n\nChecks and balances\nRepresentative Lee H Hamilton explained how Congress functions within the federal government:\n\n\nStructure\nCongress is split into two chambers – House and Senate – and manages the task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\n\n\nCommittees\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress [129] As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs The choice of specialty may be influenced by the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience [130] Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap [131] Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs [132]\n\n\nSpecializations\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a

specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs [132]\n\n\nPower\nCommittees write legislation While procedures, such as the House discharge petition process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action Committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems [133] They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber [133] In addition, they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing [133]\n\n\nOfficer\nAt the start of each two-year session, the House elects a speaker who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader In the Senate, the vice president is the ex officio president of the Senate In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the president pro tempore Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress In the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\n\n\nSupport services\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800 It is primarily housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill, but also includes several other sites: the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Washington, D.C.; the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Virginia; a large book storage facility located in Fort Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices The Library had mostly law books when it was burnt by British forces in 1814 during the War of 1812, but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of Thomas Jefferson's private library One of the library's missions is to serve Congress and its staff as well as the American public It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages [134]\n\n\nLibrary of Congress\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act

Library of Congress, provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan research for senators, representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties It provides ideas for legislation, helps members analyze a bill, facilitates public hearings, makes reports, consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure, and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements It has been called the \"House's think tank\" and has a staff of about 900 employees [135]\n\n\nCongressional Budget Office\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a federal agency which provides economic data to Congress [136]\n\n\nLobbying\nLobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients' needs Lobby groups and their members sometimes write legislation and whip bills In 2007, there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington, D.C [138] They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations Some lobbyists represent non-profit organizations and work pro bono for issues in which they are personally interested.\n\n\nPolice\nCongress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties, known as bipartisanship, and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting, known as partisanship The period after the Civil War was marked by partisanship, as is the case today It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades, but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution [139]\n\n\nPartisanship versus bipartisanship\nCongress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties, known as bipartisanship, and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting, known as partisanship The period after the Civil War was marked by partisanship, as is the case

as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution [139]\n\n\nProcedures\nA term of Congress is divided into two \"sessions\", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session A new session commences on January 3 each year unless Congress decides differently The Constitution requires Congress to meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n\nSessions\nA term of Congress is divided into two \"sessions\", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called

either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n\nJoint sessions\nJoint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from House and Senate These sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president's State of the Union address The constitutionally mandated report, normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's Speech from the Throne, was written by most presidents after Jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with Wilson in 1913 Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.\n\n\nBills and resolutions\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review [7] A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\n\n\nPublic interaction\nSenators face reelection every six years, and representatives every two Reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts [66] Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund-raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing, according to some critics [145] Although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters.\n\n\nAdvantage of incumbency\nSenators face reelection every six years, and representatives every two Reelections encourage candidates to focus their

Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund-raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing, according to some critics [145] Although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters.\n\n\nExpensive campaigns\nIn 1971, the cost of running for Congress in Utah was $70,000 [150] but costs have climbed [151] The biggest expense is television advertisements [59] [146] [150] [152] [153] Today's races cost more than a million dollars for a House seat, and six million or more for a Senate seat [11] [59] [152] [154] [155] Since fundraising is vital, \"members of Congress are forced to spend ever-increasing hours raising money for their re-election.\" [attribution needed] [156]\n\n\nTelevision and negative advertising\nSince members of Congress must advertise heavily on television, this usually involves negative advertising, which smears an opponent's character without focusing on the issues [160] Negative advertising is seen as effective because \"the messages tend to stick.\" [161] These advertisements sour the public on the political process in general as most members of Congress seek to avoid blame [162] One wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election, which leads to a culture of risk avoidance, a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors, [162] [163] and concentrating publicity efforts in the members' home districts [66]\n\n\nPerceptions\nProminent Founding Fathers, writing in The Federalist Papers, felt that elections were essential to liberty, that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential, [164] and that \"frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.\" [164] In 2009, few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress [165] [166] [167] The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but has been falling since, although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election [168] Public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job Congress is doing have, in the last few decades, hovered around 25% with some variation [11] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] Scholar Julian Zeliger suggested that the \"size, messiness, virtues, and vices that make Congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution .. Unlike the presidency, Congress is difficult to conceptualize.\" [175] Other scholars suggest that despite the criticism, \"Congress is a remarkably resilient institution .. its place in the political process is not threatened .. it is rich in resources\" and that most members behave ethically [9] They contend that \"Congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend\" and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for Congress run against Congress, which is an \"old form of American politics\" that further undermines Congress's reputation with the public: [11]\n\n\nSmaller states and bigger states\nWhen the Constitution was ratified in 1787, the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one The Connecticut Compromise gave every state, large and small, an equal vote in the Senate [177] Since each state has two senators, residents of smaller states have more clout in the Senate than residents of larger states But since 1787, the population disparity between large and small states has grown; in 2006, for example, California had seventy times the population of Wyoming [178] Critics, such as constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson, have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady redistribution of resources from \"large states to small states\" [179] [180] [181] Others argue that the Connecticut Compromise was deliberately intended by the Founding Fathers to construct the Senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population, [177] and contend that the result works well on balance.\n\n\nMembers and constituents\nA major role for members of Congress is providing services to constituents [182] Constituents request assistance with problems [183] Providing services helps members of Congress win votes and elections [148] [184] [185] and can make a difference in close races [186] Congressional staff can help citizens navigate government bureaucracies [8] One academic described the complex intertwined relation between lawmakers and constituents as home style [187]: 8 \n\n\nMotivation\nOne way to categorize lawmakers, according to former University of Rochester political science professor Richard Fenno, is by their general motivation:\n\n\nPrivileges\nRepresentative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on their future careers as lobbyists after serving – that Congress was a \"Farm League for K Street\" [188] [189] Family members of active legislators have also been hired by lobbying firms, which while not allowed to lobby their family member, has drawn criticism as a conflict of interest [190]\n\n\nOutside income and gifts\nRepresentative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on their future careers as lobbyists after serving – that Congress was a \"Farm League for K Street\" [188] [189] Family members of active legislators have also been hired by lobbying firms, which while not allowed to lobby their family member, has drawn criticism as a conflict of interest [190]\n\n\nPay\nSome critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American income [196] Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government [169] Another criticism is that members of Congress are insulated from the health care market due to their coverage [197] Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress [150] [153] In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires [198] Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute [199]\n\n\nPostage\nThe franking privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense Though they are not permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races [205] [206] Some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers [12] [failed verification] [207]\n\n\nProtection\nMembers of Congress enjoy parliamentary privilege, including freedom from arrest in all cases except for treason, felony, and breach of the peace, and freedom of speech in debate This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions [208] The term \"arrest\" has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of law enforcement, including court summons and subpoenas The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so Senate rules are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose [209]\n\n\nSee also\n38°53′23″N 77°0′32″W﻿ / ﻿38.88972°N 77.00889°W﻿ / 38.88972;

It is a bicameral legislature, consisting of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n**History**\n\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the Thirteen Colonies, which took place in 1774. This event marked the beginning of a new era in American history, as the colonies came together to discuss their grievances against the British government. The Second Continental Congress, which was formed in 1775, adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, declaring the United States to be an independent nation.\n\nThe Articles of Confederation, which were adopted in 1781, created the Congress of the Confederation, a unicameral body with equal representation among the states. However, this government proved to be ineffective, and the Articles were eventually replaced by the United States Constitution in 1789.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe United States Congress is composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n## **House of Representatives**\n\nThe House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a district in one of the 50 states. Members of the House are elected by the people of their district and serve for a term of two years.\n\n## **Senate**\n\nThe Senate has 100 members, with two senators representing each state. Senators are elected by the people of their state and serve for a term of six years.\n\n**Powers**\n\nThe United States Congress has a number of powers, including:\n\n## **Legislative Powers**\n\nThe Congress has the power to make laws, which are then signed by the President. If the President vetoes a law, it can still be passed with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate.\n\n## **Taxation Powers**\n\nThe Congress has the power to tax, which is used to fund the government and its programs.\n\n## **Regulatory Powers**\n\nThe Congress has the power to regulate commerce, which includes the power to regulate interstate trade and commerce.\n\n**Committees**\n\nThe Congress has a number of committees, which are responsible for investigating and overseeing various government programs and agencies. These committees are:\n\n## **House Committees**\n\nThe House has a number of committees, including the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Education and Labor Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n## **Senate Committees**\n\nThe Senate has a number of committees, including the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n**Lobbying**\n\nLobbying is the practice of influencing the government by means of persuasion or pressure. Lobbyists represent a variety of interests, including corporations, trade associations, and non-profit organizations.\n\n**Public Opinion**\n\nPublic opinion plays an important role in shaping the policies of the United States Congress. Members of the Congress are elected by the people, and they are expected to represent the interests of their constituents.\n\n**Perceptions**\n\nThe United States Congress is often viewed as being out of touch with the needs of the American people. This perception is due in part to the fact that many members of the Congress are wealthy and are not representative of the average American.\n\n**Smaller States and Bigger States**\n\nThe United States Congress is often criticized for favoring the interests of smaller states over those of larger states. This is due in part to the fact that each state has two senators, regardless of its population.\n\n**Members and Constituents**\n\nA major role for members of the Congress is providing services to their constituents. Constituents request assistance with problems, and members of the Congress are expected to provide this assistance.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nMembers of the Congress are motivated by a variety of factors, including a desire to serve their constituents, a desire to make a difference in the world, and a desire to advance their own careers.\n\n**Privileges**\n\nMembers of the Congress have a number of privileges, including the privilege of franking, which allows them to send official mail to their constituents at government expense.\n\n**Protection**\n\nMembers of the Congress have a number of protections, including immunity from arrest and prosecution for actions taken in the course of their duties.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe United States Congress has a number of related topics, including:\n\n* **House of Representatives**\n* **Senate**\n* **Legislative Branch**\n* **Executive Branch**\n* **Judicial Branch**\n* **Constitution**\n* **Government**\n* **Politics**\n* **Law**\n\n**References**\n\nThe United States Congress is a complex and multifaceted institution, and this article is intended to provide a general overview of its history, structure, powers, and functions.

Declaration of Independence, referring to the new nation as the \"United States of America\" The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created the Congress of the Confederation, a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions Congress had executive but not legislative authority, and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty [15] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws [16] [17]\n\n\n18th century\nThe First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the Thirteen

legislative authority, and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty [15] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws [16] [17]\n\n\n19th century\nIn 1800, Thomas Jefferson's election to the presidency marked a peaceful transition of power between the parties John Marshall, 4th chief justice of the Supreme Court, empowered the courts by establishing the principle of judicial review in law in the landmark case Marbury v Madison in 1803, effectively giving the Supreme Court a power to nullify congressional legislation [29] [30]\n\n\n20th century\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, party structures and leadership emerged as key organizers of Senate proceedings [34]\n\n\n21st century\nIn 2009, Congress authorized another delegate for the Northern Mariana Islands These six members of Congress enjoy floor privileges to introduce bills and resolutions, and in recent Congresses they vote in permanent and select committees, in party caucuses and in joint conferences with the Senate They have Capitol Hill offices, staff and two annual appointments to each of the four military academies While their votes are constitutional when Congress authorizes their House Committee of the Whole votes, recent Congresses have not allowed for that, and they cannot vote when the House is meeting as the House of Representatives [75]\n\n\nWomen in Congress\nVarious social and structural barriers have prevented women from gaining seats in Congress In the early 20th century, women's domestic roles and the inability to vote forestalled opportunities to run for and hold public office The two party system and the lack of term limits favored incumbent white men, making the widow's succession – in which a woman temporarily took over a seat vacated by the death of her husband – the most common path to Congress for white women [77]\n\n\nRole\nArticle One of the Constitution creates and sets forth the structure and most of the powers of Congress Sections One through Six describe how Congress is elected and gives each House the power to create its own structure Section Seven lays out the process for creating laws, and

Congress does not have, and Section Ten enumerates powers of the state, some of which may only be granted by Congress [83] Constitutional amendments have granted Congress additional powers Congress also has implied powers derived from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause.\n\n\nEnumeration\nThe Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress in detail In addition, other congressional powers have been granted, or confirmed, by constitutional amendments The Thirteenth (1865), Fourteenth (1868), and Fifteenth Amendments (1870) gave Congress authority to enact legislation to enforce rights of African Americans, including voting rights, due process, and equal protection under the law [107] Generally militia forces are controlled by state governments, not Congress [108]\n\n\nImplicit, commerce clause\nCongress also has implied powers deriving from the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause which permit Congress to \"make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof\" [109] Broad interpretations of this clause and of the Commerce Clause, the enumerated power to regulate commerce, in rulings such as McCulloch v Maryland, have effectively widened the scope of Congress's legislative authority far beyond that prescribed in Section Eight [110] [111]\n\n\nTerritorial government\nConstitutional responsibility for the oversight of Washington, D.C., the federal district and national capital, and the U.S territories of Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands rests with Congress [112] The republican form of government in territories is devolved by congressional statute to the respective territories including direct election of governors, the D.C mayor and locally elective territorial legislatures [113]\n\n\nChecks and balances\nRepresentative Lee H Hamilton explained how Congress functions within the federal government:\n\n\nStructure\nCongress is split into two chambers – House and Senate – and manages the task of writing national legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees Further, Congress has ancillary organizations such as the Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.\n\n\nCommittees\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely It is neither expected nor possible that a member be an expert on all subject areas before Congress [129] As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs The choice of specialty may be influenced by the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience [130] Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap [131] Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs [132]\n\n\nSpecializations\nThe committee structure permits members of Congress to study a particular subject intensely It is neither expected nor possible

procedures, such as the House discharge petition process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action Committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems [133] They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber [133] In addition, they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing [133]\n\n\nOfficer\nAt the start of each two-year session, the House elects a speaker who does not normally preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader In the Senate, the vice president is the ex officio president of the Senate In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the president pro tempore Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there is a change in party control Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore at the beginning of a new Congress In the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.\n\n\nSupport services\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800 It is primarily housed in three buildings on Capitol Hill, but also includes several other sites: the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Washington, D.C.; the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Virginia; a large book storage facility located in Fort Meade, Maryland; and multiple overseas offices The Library had mostly law books when it was burnt by British forces in 1814 during the War of 1812, but the library's collections were restored and expanded when Congress authorized the purchase of Thomas Jefferson's private library One of the library's missions is to serve Congress and its staff as well as the American public It is the largest library in the world with nearly 150 million items including books, films, maps, photographs, music, manuscripts, graphics, and materials in 470 languages [134]\n\n\nLibrary of Congress\nThe Library of Congress was established by an act of Congress in 1800 It is primarily housed in three buildings on

representatives, and their staff to help them carry out their official duties It provides ideas for legislation, helps members analyze a bill, facilitates public hearings, makes reports, consults on matters such as parliamentary procedure, and helps the two chambers resolve disagreements It has been called the \"House's think tank\" and has a staff of about 900 employees [135]\n\n\nCongressional Budget Office\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a federal agency which provides economic data to Congress [136]\n\n\nLobbying\nLobbyists represent diverse interests and often seek to influence congressional decisions to reflect their clients' needs Lobby groups and their members sometimes write legislation and whip bills In 2007, there were approximately 17,000 federal lobbyists in Washington, D.C [138] They explain to legislators the goals of their organizations Some lobbyists represent non-profit organizations and work pro bono for issues in which they are personally interested.\n\n\nPolice\nCongress has alternated between periods of constructive cooperation and compromise between parties, known as bipartisanship, and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting, known as partisanship The period after the Civil War was marked by partisanship, as is the case today It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when compromise is possible Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades, but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution [139]\n\n\nPartisanship

alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies, as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution [139]\n\n\nProcedures\nA term of Congress is divided into two \"sessions\", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session A new session commences on January 3 each year unless Congress decides differently The Constitution requires Congress to meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n\nSessions\nA term of Congress is divided into two \"sessions\", one for each year; Congress has occasionally been called into an extra or special session A new session commences on January 3 each year unless Congress decides differently The Constitution requires Congress to meet at least once each year and forbids either house from meeting outside the Capitol without the consent of the other house.\n\n\nJoint sessions\nJoint sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that require a concurrent resolution from House and Senate These sessions include counting electoral votes after a presidential election and the president's State of the Union address The constitutionally mandated report, normally given as an annual speech, is modeled on Britain's Speech from the Throne, was written by most presidents after Jefferson but personally delivered as a spoken oration beginning with Wilson in 1913 Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the speaker of the House, except when counting presidential electoral votes when the vice president (acting as the president of the Senate) presides.\n\n\nBills and resolutions\nIdeas for legislation can come from members, lobbyists, state legislatures, constituents, legislative counsel, or executive agencies Anyone can write a bill, but only members of Congress may introduce bills Most bills are not written by Congress members, but originate from the Executive branch; interest groups often draft bills as well The usual next step is for the proposal to be passed to a committee for review [7] A proposal is usually in one of these forms:\n\n\nPublic interaction\nSenators face reelection every six years, and representatives every two Reelections encourage candidates to focus their publicity efforts at their home states or districts [66] Running for reelection can be a grueling process of distant travel and fund-raising which distracts senators and representatives from paying attention to governing, according to some critics [145] Although others respond that the process is necessary to keep members of Congress in touch with voters.\n\n\nAdvantage of

heavily on television, this usually involves negative advertising, which smears an opponent's character without focusing on the issues [160] Negative advertising is seen as effective because \"the messages tend to stick.\" [161] These advertisements sour the public on the political process in general as most members of Congress seek to avoid blame [162] One wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election, which leads to a culture of risk avoidance, a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors, [162] [163] and concentrating publicity efforts in the members' home districts [66]\n\n\nPerceptions\nProminent Founding Fathers, writing in The Federalist Papers, felt that elections were essential to liberty, that a bond between the people and the representatives was particularly essential, [164] and that \"frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.\" [164] In 2009, few Americans were familiar with leaders of Congress [165] [166] [167] The percentage of Americans eligible to vote who did, in fact, vote was 63% in 1960, but has been falling since, although there was a slight upward trend in the 2008 election [168] Public opinion polls asking people if they approve of the job Congress is doing have, in the last few decades, hovered around 25% with some variation [11] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] Scholar Julian Zeliger suggested that the \"size, messiness, virtues, and vices that make Congress so interesting also create enormous barriers to our understanding the institution .. Unlike the presidency, Congress is difficult to conceptualize.\" [175] Other scholars suggest that despite the criticism, \"Congress is a remarkably resilient institution .. its place in the political process is not threatened .. it is rich in resources\" and that most members behave ethically [9] They contend that \"Congress is easy to dislike and often difficult to defend\" and this perception is exacerbated because many challengers running for Congress run against Congress, which is an \"old form of American politics\" that further undermines Congress's reputation with the public: [11]\n\n\nSmaller states and bigger states\nWhen the Constitution was ratified in 1787, the ratio of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one The Connecticut Compromise gave every state, large and small, an equal vote in the Senate [177] Since each state has two senators, residents of smaller states have more clout in the Senate than residents of larger states But since 1787, the population disparity between large and small states has grown; in 2006, for example, California had seventy times the population of Wyoming [178] Critics, such as constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson, have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady redistribution of resources from \"large states to small states\" [179] [180] [181] Others argue that the Connecticut Compromise was deliberately intended by the Founding Fathers to construct the Senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population, [177] and contend that the result works well on balance.\n\n\nMembers and constituents\nA major role for members of Congress is providing services to constituents [182] Constituents request assistance with problems [183] Providing services helps members of Congress win votes and elections [148] [184] [185] and can make a difference in close races [186] Congressional staff can help citizens navigate government bureaucracies [8] One academic described the complex intertwined relation between lawmakers and constituents as home style [187]: 8 \n\n\nMotivation\nOne way to categorize lawmakers, according to former University of Rochester political science professor Richard Fenno, is by their general motivation:\n\n\nPrivileges\nRepresentative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on their future careers as lobbyists after serving – that Congress was a \"Farm League for K Street\" [188] [189] Family members of active legislators have also been hired by lobbying firms, which while not allowed to lobby their family member, has drawn criticism as a conflict of interest [190]\n\n\nOutside income and gifts\nRepresentative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on their future careers as lobbyists after serving – that Congress was a \"Farm League for K Street\" [188] [189] Family members of active legislators have also been hired by lobbying firms, which while not allowed to lobby their family member, has drawn criticism as a conflict of interest [190]\n\n\nPay\nSome critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American income [196] Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government [169] Another criticism is that members of Congress are insulated from the health care market due to their coverage [197] Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress [150] [153] In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires [198] Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute [199]\n\n\nPostage\nThe franking privilege allows members of Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense Though they are not permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races [205] [206] Some academics consider free mailings as giving incumbents a big advantage over challengers [12] [failed verification] [207]\n\n\nProtection\nMembers of Congress enjoy parliamentary privilege, including freedom from arrest in all cases except for treason, felony, and breach of the peace, and freedom of speech in debate This constitutionally derived immunity applies to members during sessions and when traveling to and from sessions [208] The term \"arrest\" has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course of law enforcement, including court summons and subpoenas The rules of the House strictly guard this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on their own but must seek the permission of the whole house to do so Senate rules are less strict and permit individual senators to waive the privilege as they choose [209]\n\n\nSee also\n38°53′23″N 77°0′32″W﻿ / ﻿38.88972°N 77.00889°W﻿ / 38.88972;

was courting Princess Anne [47] Though Shand and Charles belonged to the same social circle and occasionally attended the same events, they had not formally met Gyles Brandreth states that they did not first meet at a polo match, as has been commonly believed [48] [49] Instead, they first met at the home of their friend Lucía Santa Cruz, who formally introduced them [25] [50] They became close

rehabilitation\nFollowing both of their divorces, Charles declared his relationship with Parker Bowles was \"non-negotiable\" [79] Charles was aware that the relationship was receiving a lot of negative publicity, and appointed Mark Bolland—whom he had employed in 1995 to refurbish his own image‍—‌to enhance Parker Bowles's public profile [80] In July 1997, she was involved in a head-on car accident while driving to Highgrove House, though neither she nor the other driver sustained any major injuries [81] Parker Bowles occasionally became Charles's unofficial companion at events In 1999,

each side [98] As the future supreme governor of the Church of England, the prospect of Charles marrying a divorcée was seen as controversial, but with the consent of the Queen, [99] the government, [100] and the Church of England, the couple were able to wed The Queen and Tony Blair, along with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, offered their best wishes in statements to the media [101] In the two months following the announcement of their engagement, Clarence House received 25,000 letters with \"95 or 99 per cent being supportive\"; 908 hate mail letters were also received, with the

Duchess of Cornwall, is the second wife of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the Queen consort of the United Kingdom. Born as Camilla Rosemary Shand, she has been a prominent figure in British society for several decades, known for her philanthropic work, fashion sense, and her long-standing relationship with Charles.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nCamilla Rosemary Shand was born on 17 July 1947 at King's College Hospital, London. Her family split their time between their country house, The Laines in Plumpton, East Sussex, and their London house in South Kensington. Her parents, Major Bruce Shand and Rosalind, were a British Army officer-turned-businessman and a member of the aristocracy, respectively. Camilla has a younger sister, Annabel Elliot, and a younger brother, Mark Shand, who was a travel writer and conservationist. One of her maternal great-grandmothers, Alice Keppel, was a mistress of King Edward VII.\n\n## Marriages and Children\n\nIn the late 1960s, Camilla met Andrew Parker Bowles, then a Guards officer, through his younger brother, Simon, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair. After an on-and-off relationship for years, Parker Bowles and Shand's engagement was announced in The Times in 1973. However, the engagement was reportedly sent out by the pair's parents without their knowledge, forcing Parker Bowles to propose. They married on 4 July 1973 in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, in London. The wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles's goddaughter, Lady Emma Herbert. The ceremony was considered the \"society wedding of the year\" with 800 guests, including royal guests such as Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne, and the Queen's sister, Margaret.\n\n## First Marriage\n\nCamilla's first marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles was marked by periods of separation and reconciliation. In the late 1960s, Shand met Prince Charles in mid-1971, and they began a romantic relationship, which was well known within their social circle. As a couple, they regularly met at polo matches at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, where Charles often played polo. They also became part of a set at Annabel's in Berkeley Square.

their time between their country house—18th-century The Laines [2] in Plumpton, East Sussex [3]—and their London house in South Kensington [4] Her parents were British Army officer-turned-businessman Major Bruce Shand and his wife, Rosalind, daughter of Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe Camilla has a younger sister, Annabel Elliot, and had a younger brother, Mark Shand [5] One of her maternal great-grandmothers, Alice Keppel, was a mistress of King Edward VII [6] [7]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nIn the late 1960s, Shand met Andrew Parker Bowles, then a Guards officer – a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals through his younger brother, Simon, who worked for her father's wine firm in Mayfair [29] After an on-and-off relationship for years, Parker Bowles and Shand's engagement was announced in The Times in 1973 [30] Sally Bedell Smith claimed that the announcement was sent out by the pair's parents without their knowledge, which forced Parker Bowles to propose [31] They married on 4 July 1973 in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Guards' Chapel, Wellington Barracks, in London [32] Shand was 25 years old and Parker Bowles 33 Her wedding dress was designed by British fashion house Bellville Sassoon, [32] and the bridesmaids included Parker Bowles's goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert [33] It was considered the \"society wedding of the year\" [34] with 800 guests [32] Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne; the Queen's sister, Margaret; and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [34]\n\n\nFirst marriage\nIn the late

considered the \"society wedding of the year\" [34] with 800 guests [32] Royal guests present at the ceremony and reception included Queen Elizabeth II's daughter, Anne; the Queen's sister, Margaret; and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [34]\n\n\nRelationship with Charles\nShand reportedly met Prince Charles in mid-1971 [46] Andrew Parker Bowles had ended his relationship with Shand in 1970 and was courting Princess Anne [47] Though Shand and Charles belonged to the same social circle and occasionally attended the same events, they had not formally met Gyles Brandreth states that they did not first meet at a polo match, as has been commonly believed [48] [49] Instead, they first met at the home of their friend Lucía Santa Cruz, who formally introduced them [25] [50] They became close friends and eventually began a romantic relationship, which was well known within their social circle [51] As a couple, they regularly met at polo matches at Smith's Lawn in Windsor Great Park, where Charles often played polo [52] They also became part of a set at Annabel's in Berkeley Square [46] As the relationship grew more serious, Charles met Shand's family in Plumpton, and he introduced her to some members of his family [53] The relationship was put on hold after Charles travelled overseas to join the Royal Navy in early 1973, and ended abruptly afterward [1] [54]\n\n\nImage rehabilitation\nFollowing both of their divorces, Charles declared his relationship with Parker Bowles was \"non-negotiable\" [79] Charles was aware that the relationship was receiving a lot of negative publicity, and appointed Mark Bolland—whom he had employed in 1995 to refurbish his own image‍—‌to enhance Parker Bowles's public profile [80] In July 1997, she was involved in a head-on car accident while driving to Highgrove House, though neither she nor the other driver sustained any major injuries [81] Parker Bowles occasionally became Charles's unofficial companion at events In 1999,

each side [98] As the future supreme governor of the Church of England, the prospect of Charles marrying a divorcée was seen as controversial, but with the consent of the Queen, [99] the government, [100] and the Church of England, the couple were able to wed The Queen and Tony Blair, along with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, offered their best wishes in statements to the media [101] In

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [159] had warned that extreme weather events would become more common as a consequence of climate change, including heavy rainfall In an interview with CNA, Renard said that due to climate change, it would be harder for climatologists to predict the weather accurately, citing that the northeast monsoon which usually causes floods on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia has also affected the west coast this time He also disagreed with the government's claims regarding the 100-year flood, citing that in recent years, the devastating flooding caused by climate change had recently occurred in other regions including Europe, China and the United States His statement was later echoed by environment lecturer at Universiti Putra Malaysia, Haliza Abdul Rahman, where she added that this flood and the recent floods in Turkey were caused by climate change She also similarly disagreed that the flood was labelled as a \"100-year flood\", as similar events could also happen in the future [160] In order to mitigate this issue, aside from improving weather monitoring systems, experts and activists have urged action to be taken to reduce the effects of climate change This includes reducing carbon emissions, encouraging public transport and carpooling as a means of transportation, ending deforestation, and encouraging global cooperation to tackle climate change [160] Moreover, this could involve reviewing the construction of infrastructure that will be affected by storms, flooding and rising sea levels, and granting international aid to help countries cope with climate change [161]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2021–2022 Malaysian Floods**\n\nThe 2021–2022 Malaysian floods, also known as the Kelantan flood, were a series of floods that occurred in Malaysia in late 2021 and early 2022. The floods were caused by heavy rainfall and poor drainage, resulting in widespread flooding and displacement of thousands of people.\n\n**Weather Events**\n\nThe floods were triggered by a tropical depression that formed in the South China Sea on December 14, 2021. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and made landfall in the state of Pahang on December 16, 2021. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing widespread flooding and damage to homes and infrastructure.\n\nThe flooding was exacerbated by the heavy rainfall, which was caused by a combination of factors, including the northeast monsoon and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The heavy rainfall caused rivers to overflow, resulting in widespread flooding and displacement of thousands of people.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nPrior to the floods, the Kelantan Welfare Department prepared RM1.3 million (US$309,500) for relief efforts. The National Disaster Command Centre (NDCC) had planned 5,731 temporary shelters that could accommodate over 1.6 million victims across the nation for emergency purposes.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe floods had a significant impact on the people and the economy of Malaysia. Thousands of people were displaced, and many homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. The flooding also caused widespread power outages and disruptions to transportation and communication services.\n\nThe flooding was particularly severe in the states of Kelantan, Selangor, and Kuala Lumpur. In Kelantan, five rivers recorded rises in water levels, with three achieving dangerous levels for the next two days. Multiple districts of Kelantan were flooded, leading to the evacuation of 548 inhabitants from four districts, housed in eight temporary shelters.\n\nIn Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, the flooding was even more severe. MetMalaysia issued the severest alert for 8 districts at the state for continuous rainfall since December 17 for 4 days. However, floods had already been present at Sepang, Hulu Langat, and Klang a day before the warning was issued. 16 rivers had breached the danger level by then.\n\nThe flooding caused widespread damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure. In the township of Taman Sri Muda, located at Shah Alam, 14 deaths were reported. The township was entirely flooded and suffered catastrophic damage. 16 pumps were used to expedite the pumping process at Sri Muda.\n\n**Terengganu**\n\nMinor flooding prior to the landfall of 29W on December 3 left 140 people displaced at Setiu and Besut for several days.\n\n**Bentong Mudslide**\n\nDuring the late-night of December 18, a mudslide at Bentong destroyed a series of chalets. Ten were swept away by the strong currents, and five were killed during the incident.\n\n**Sabah**\n\nMany parts of Sabah started evacuations as rain continued to pour in areas such as Kudat. The number of evacuees increased to approximately 1,161 people (from Kota Marudu, Kudat, Paitan, Beluran, Telupid, and Sandakan).\n\n**Malacca**\n\nHeavy rain had persisted over Alor Gajah, Melaka Tengah, and Jasin since December 17. The first temporary shelter was opened the following day when 40 people were evacuated amidst floods across several villages. The rising water levels at Rembau River caused the collapse of the riverbanks near the Berembang River, resulting in floods at Lubok Cina that were 1.8 meters deep. It was reported to be the worst floods to hit the region in 50 years.\n\n**Negeri Sembilan**\n\nNegeri Sembilan was hit by floods on December 18. 274 people were evacuated from 29 different areas in the initial displacement. They were sheltered at five relief centres. A government clinic at Jelebu could not operate due to floods. The NDCC accounted 68 severely damaged telecommunications towers throughout the state. Operations in two water treatment plants in Seremban and Jelebu were paralyzed after receiving structural damages.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe Malaysian government responded to the floods by deploying troops and equipment to affected areas. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, visited several affected areas and pledged support to the victims.\n\n**International Response**\n\nThe international community also responded to the floods, with several countries offering aid and assistance to Malaysia. The United States, Japan, and Singapore were among the countries that offered aid.\n\n**Non-Governmental Organizations**\n\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) also played a significant role in responding to the floods. Several NGOs, including the Red Cross and the Malaysian Medical Relief Society, provided aid and assistance to the victims.\n\n**Criticism of the Government**\n\nThe government's response to the floods was criticized by several opposition politicians and civil society groups. They accused the government of being slow to respond to the crisis and of not providing adequate support to the victims.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nIn June 2022, 50 residents of Taman Sri Muda in Shah Alam, Selangor, have filed a lawsuit in the Shah Alam High Court against 10 respondents for more than RM3.7 million in compensation over the December 2021 floods.\n\n**Connection to Climate Change**\n\nPrior to the floods, scientists and organizations had warned that extreme weather events would become more common as a consequence of climate change, including heavy rainfall. Experts and activists have urged action to be taken to reduce the effects of climate change, including reducing carbon emissions, encouraging public transport and carpooling, ending deforestation, and encouraging global cooperation to tackle climate change.\n\nThe floods in Malaysia were a significant event that highlighted the impact of climate change on the country and the world. The event served as a reminder of the importance of taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changing climate.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

years, the devastating flooding caused by climate change had recently occurred in other regions including Europe, China and the United States His statement was later echoed by environment lecturer at

Roussimoff came out to congratulate him, shaking Hogan's hand with a strong grip, which surprised the Hulkster [64] On the following week's Piper's Pit, Roussimoff was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being \"the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.\" Although he had suffered a handful of countout and disqualification losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring Hogan came out to congratulate him and ended up being the focal point of the interview Apparently annoyed, Roussimoff walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech [65] [66] A discussion between Roussimoff and Hogan was scheduled, and on a Piper's Pit that aired 7 February 1987, the two met [67] Hogan was introduced first, followed by Roussimoff, who was led by longtime rival Bobby Heenan.\n\n\nColossal Connection (1989–1990)\nIn late 1989, Roussimoff was joined with fellow Heenan Family member Haku to form a new tag team called the Colossal Connection, in part to fill a void left by the departure of Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson (the Brain Busters, who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging Roussimoff in the main event spotlight His last singles match was a loss to The Ultimate Warrior in 20 seconds at a house show in Cape Girardeau, Missouri on 11 December 1989 [85] The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters) At a television taping on 13 December 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles [86] Roussimoff and Haku successfully defended their title, mostly against Demolition, until WrestleMania VI on 1 April 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts [87] After the match, a furious Heenan blamed him for the title loss and after shouting at him, before Heenan slapped him in the face; an angry Roussimoff responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring [88] Roussimoff also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting support and turning Roussimoff face for the first time since 1987 Due to his ongoing health issues, Roussimoff was unable to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging him in.\n\n\nSporadic appearances (1990–1991)\nRoussimoff returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation Instead, Roussimoff made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on 11 October in Reseda, California [90] (the segment aired in 1991) He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF [91] The following month on 30 November at a house show in Miami, Florida, the World Wrestling Federation announced his return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami two months later) Roussimoff was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury [92]\n\n\nAll Japan Pro Wrestling;

She was the youngest serving head of government in the world at the time of her appointment, and the third female Prime Minister of Finland.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nSanna Marin was born on 16 November 1985 in Helsinki, Finland. She also lived in Espoo and Pirkkala before moving to Tampere with her family. Marin's parents separated when she was very young, and she was raised by her mother and her mother's female partner. This experience has shaped her perspective on family and relationships, and she has spoken publicly about the importance of same-sex families.\n\nMarin's early life was marked by financial difficulties, and her family struggled to make ends meet. However, this experience did not deter her from pursuing her education. She attended a local school in Tampere and later went on to study at the University of Tampere, where she graduated with a degree in adult education.\n\n**Early political career**\n\nMarin's entry into politics began at the age of 20, when she joined the Social Democratic Youth. She quickly rose through the ranks and became the organization's first director in 2010. During her time as director, she worked closely with the party's leadership and helped to shape the organization's policies.\n\nIn 2015, Marin was elected as a member of the Tampere City Council, where she served for four years. During her time on the council, she focused on issues related to education, social welfare, and environmental protection.\n\n**Prime Minister of Finland (2019–2023)**\n\nIn December 2019, Marin was nominated by the Social Democratic Party to succeed Antti Rinne as Prime Minister of Finland. She was elected by the Finnish parliament, and her government was sworn in on 10 December 2019. Marin was just 34 years old at the time, making her the youngest serving head of government in the world.\n\nMarin's government was a coalition of five parties, including the Social Democrats, the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party, the Left Alliance, and the Green League. She was the first female Prime Minister of Finland to lead a coalition government.\n\nDuring her time as Prime Minister, Marin focused on issues related to climate change, education, and social welfare. She also worked to promote the role of women in politics and to support the rights of marginalized communities.\n\n**Foreign policy**\n\nMarin has been an outspoken critic of human rights abuses around the world. In March 2021, she condemned the persecution of ethnic Uyghurs in the Chinese province of Xinjiang, and emphasized that \"trade or the economy is not a reason to ignore these atrocities.\"\n\n**Trendi photoshoot**\n\nIn October 2020, Marin was featured on the cover of the Finnish lifestyle magazine Trendi. The photo shoot was accompanied by an interview in which she discussed her job and its expectations. However, the photo itself generated controversy, as some critics accused her of demeaning her office by wearing a low-cut trouser suit with no shirt underneath.\n\n**Spending**\n\nIn May 2021, Finnish media reported that Marin and her family were spending about €300 per month on groceries with public funds as part of the Prime Minister's tax-free housing benefits in the official residence, Kesäranta. The legality of the customary arrangement was questioned, as the rules on residential benefits did not explicitly mention food provisions.\n\nHowever, it was later revealed that the amount spent was actually €850 per month, not €300. Marin and her family had used around €14,363.20 on catering services in the form of breakfast provisions and cold evening meals in the Prime Minister's official residence between January 2020 and May 2021.\n\n**Actions during the COVID-19 pandemic**\n\nIn December 2021, Marin visited a night club in Helsinki with some friends, despite having been in contact with Finland's foreign minister earlier that day, who had subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Marin was advised by an Undersecretary of State that she did not need to self-isolate, as she was fully vaccinated. However, two text messages were sent to her governmental work phone alerting her that she should self-isolate, but she did not receive them because she was only carrying her parliamentary work phone.\n\n**Private party videos**\n\nIn August 2022, leaked videos of Marin partying and dancing in an apartment in Helsinki became public, and went viral. In response to what Marin called \"serious allegations in the public domain\" regarding drug use, she voluntarily took a drug test on 19 August and tested negative.\n\n**Sámi rights legislation**\n\nIn October 2022, Marin apologized to the Indigenous Sámi people for the delays in the reform of the Sámi human rights legislation. The legislation has been in the making for three parliamentary terms without success, and has been repeatedly blocked by the Centre Party.\n\n**2023 election**\n\nOn 2 April 2023, Marin conceded defeat to her center-right rivals, the National Coalition, led by Petteri Orpo, as her party came in third in the 2023 Finnish parliamentary election, behind Orpo's NCP and the nationalists Finns, led by Riikka Purra.\n\n**Career after tenure as Prime Minister (2023–)**\n\nOn 5 April 2023, Marin announced that she would resign as the leader of the Social Democratic Party at the next party congress in the autumn. She was succeeded by Antti Lindtman on 1 September 2023.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nMarin describes herself as coming from a \"rainbow family\", as she was raised by two female parents. She was the first person in her family to attend university.\n\n**Awards and reception**\n\nMarin was selected for the cover of Time magazine's \"Time100 Next\" theme issue, which showcases one hundred influential leaders from around the world. In the December 2022 Financial Times selected Marin on the 25 most influential women list.\n\n**Further reading**\n\nFor further information on Sanna Marin, see:\n\n* \"Sanna Marin: The youngest Prime Minister in the world\" by The Guardian\n* \"Sanna Marin: The Finnish leader who's making waves\" by The New York Times\n* \"Sanna Marin: The woman who's challenging the status quo in Finland\" by The Economist\n\n**External links**\n\nFor more information on Sanna Marin, see:\n\n* Sanna Marin's official website\n* Sanna Marin on Twitter\n* Sanna Marin on Facebook", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sanna_Marin\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nSanna Mirella Marin was born on 16 November 1985 in Helsinki [3] [4] [5] She also lived in Espoo and Pirkkala before moving to Tampere [6] Her parents separated when she was very young;

Monday is made around this date as well (which happened in 1957, 1985, and 2013).\n\n\nLocations\nMost presidential inaugurations since 1801 have been held in Washington D.C at the Capitol Building Prior inaugurations were held, first at Federal Hall in New York City (1789), [5] and then at Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1793 and 1797) Each city was, at the time, the nation's capital The location for James Monroe's 1817 swearing in was moved to the Old Brick Capitol in Washington due to ongoing restoration work at the Capitol building following the War of 1812 [6]  Three other inaugurations—Franklin D Roosevelt's fourth (1945), Harry S Truman's first (1945), and Gerald Ford's (1974)—were held at the White House.\n\n\nOrganizers\nBefore Inauguration Day, the president-elect will name a Presidential Inaugural Committee This committee is the legal entity responsible for fundraising for and the planning and coordination of all official events and activities surrounding the inauguration of president and vice president (other than the ceremony), such as the balls and parade [11]\n\n\nAttendees\nIn addition to the public, the attendees at the inauguration generally include the vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, high-ranking military officers, former presidents and vice-presidents, living Medal of Honor recipients, and other dignitaries The outgoing president and vice president also customarily attend the ceremony.\n\n\nCommunication\nThe way inauguration ceremony events are communicated to the public has changed over the years with each advance in technology Improvements in mass media technologies have allowed presidents to reach substantially greater numbers of their constituents In 1829, Andrew Jackson spoke to approximately 10,000 people at his inauguration [18] Most recently, in 2017, it is estimated that about 160,000 people were in the National Mall areas in the hour leading up to Donald Trump's swearing in [19] An additional 30.6 million people in the United States watched it on television, [20] and more than 6.8 million worldwide streamed it live on Twitter [21] Among the inauguration mass communication milestones are: [22]\n\n\nCeremony elements\nInauguration procedure is governed by tradition rather than the Constitution, the only constitutionally required procedure being the presidential oath of office (which may be taken anywhere, with anyone in attendance who can legally witness an oath, and at any time prior to the actual beginning of the new president's term) [14] Traditionally, the president-elect arrives at the White House and then proceeds to the Capitol Building with the out-going president Around or after 12 noon, the president takes the oath of office, usually administered by the chief justice of the United States, and then delivers the inaugural address.\n\n\nOaths of office\nThe vice president is sworn into office in the same ceremony as the president Prior to 1937, the vice presidential oath was administered in the Senate Chamber (in keeping with the vice president's position as president of the Senate) The oath is administered to the vice president first Immediately afterwards, the United States Marine Band will perform four \"ruffles and flourishes\", followed by \"Hail, Columbia\" Unlike the presidential oath, however, the Constitution does not specify specific words that must be spoken Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789 The current form, which is also recited by senators, representatives, and other government officers, has been in use since 1884:\n\n\nInaugural address\nNewly sworn-in presidents usually give a speech referred to as an inaugural address As with many inaugural customs, this one was started by George Washington in 1789 After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall, he proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries Every president since Washington has delivered an inaugural address While many of the early presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the chief justice administer the oath first, followed by the president's speech [12] William McKinley requested the change in 1897, so that he could reiterate the words of the oath at the close of his first inaugural address.\n\n\nPrayers\nSince 1937, the ceremony has incorporated one or more prayers [39] [40]  Since 1933 an associated prayer service either public or private attended by the president-elect has often taken place on the morning of the day [41]  At times a major public or broadcast prayer service takes place after the main ceremony most recently on the next day [42]\n\n\nPoems\nSix inaugural ceremonies since 1961 have included a reading by a poet [43] The following poetry readings have taken place: \n\n\nOther elements\nOver the years, various inauguration traditions have arisen that have expanded the event from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long one, including parades, speeches, and balls In fact, contemporary inaugural celebrations typically span 10 days, from five days before the inauguration to five days after On some occasions however, either due to the preferences of the new president or to other constraining circumstances, they have been scaled back Such was the case in 1945, because of rationing in effect during World War II More recently, in 1973, the celebrations marking Richard Nixon's second inauguration were altered because of the death of former president Lyndon B Johnson two days after the ceremony All pending events were cancelled so preparations for Johnson's state funeral could begin Because of the construction work on the center steps of the East Front, Johnson's casket was taken up the Senate wing steps of the Capitol when taken into the rotunda to lie in state [50] When it was brought out, it came out through the House wing steps of the Capitol [50] In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festivities were scaled back.\n\n\nCongressional luncheon\nSince 1953, the president and vice president have been guests of honor at a luncheon held by the leadership of the United States Congress immediately following the inaugural ceremony The luncheon is held in Statuary Hall and is organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, and attended by the leadership of both houses of Congress as well as guests of the president and vice president By tradition, the outgoing president and vice president will not attend In 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the luncheon was replaced by a gift-giving ceremony.\n\n\nInaugural parade\nFollowing the arrival of the presidential entourage to the White House, it is customary for the president, vice-president, their respective families and leading members of the government and military to review an inaugural parade from an enclosed stand at the edge of the North Lawn, a custom begun by James Garfield in 1881 The parade, which proceeds along 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the stand and the Front Lawn in view of the presidential party, features both military and civilian participants from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; this parade largely evolved from the post-inaugural procession to the White House, and occurred as far back as Jefferson's second inauguration in 1805, when workers from the Washington Navy Yard, accompanied by military music, marched with the president [51] on foot as he rode on horseback from the Capitol to the White House By the time of William Henry Harrison's inauguration in 1841, political clubs and marching societies would regularly travel to Washington for the parade That year was also the first in which floats were part of the parade It was at Lincoln's second inauguration, in 1865, that Native Americans and African Americans participated in the inaugural parade for the first time [52] Women were involved for the first time in 1917 [53]\n\n\nInterfaith national prayer service\nA tradition of an interfaith national prayer service, usually the day after the inauguration, dates back to George Washington and since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the prayer service has been held at the Washington National Cathedral [60] This is not the same as the Inaugural Prayer, a tradition also begun by Washington, when on June 1, 1789, Methodist bishops Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke, Rev John Dickins, the pastor of Old St George's (America's oldest Methodist Church) and Major Thomas Morrell, one of President Washington's former aides-de-camp called upon Washington in New York City [61] This tradition resumed in 1985 with President Reagan and continues under the auspices of a Presidential Inaugural Prayer Committee based at Old St George's.\n\n\nInaugural balls\nThe first Inaugural Ball was held on the night of James Madison's first inauguration in 1809 Tickets were $4 and it took place at Long's Hotel [53]\n\n\nSecurity\nThe security for the inaugural celebrations is a complex matter, involving the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service (DHS-FPS), all five branches of the Armed Forces, the Capitol Police, the United States Park Police (USPP), and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) Federal law enforcement agencies also sometimes request assistance from various other state and local law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States.\n\n\nPresidential medals\nBeginning with George Washington, there has been a traditional association with Inauguration festivities and the production of a presidential medal With the District of Columbia attracting thousands of attendees for inauguration, presidential medals were an inexpensive souvenir for the tourists to remember the occasion However, the once-simple trinket turned into an official presidential election memento In 1901, the first Inauguration Committee [62] [failed verification] on Medals and Badges was established as part of the official Inauguration Committee for the re-election of President McKinley The Committee saw official medals as a way to raise funding for the festivities Gold medals were to be produced as gifts for the president, vice president, and committee chair; silver medals were to be created and distributed among Inauguration Committee members, and bronze medals would be for sale for public consumption McKinley's medal was simple with his portrait on one side and writing on the other side [63]\n\n\nList of inauguration ceremonies\nThe 59 inauguration ceremonies marking the start of a new four-year presidential term of office and also the nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president are listed in the table

Inauguration**\n\nThe United States presidential inauguration is a ceremony held every four years, marking the beginning of a new term of office for the President of the United States. The inauguration is a significant event in American politics, symbolizing the transfer of power from one president to another. The ceremony has evolved over time, incorporating various traditions and elements that reflect the country's history, culture, and democratic values.\n\n**Inauguration Ceremonies**\n\nThe first inauguration ceremony took place on April 30, 1789, when George Washington was sworn in as the first President of the United States. Since then, the inauguration has been held on various dates, depending on the president-elect's preference and the requirements of the Constitution. Prior to 1937, the inauguration was held on March 4, which was the day the federal government began operations under the U.S. Constitution in 1789. However, when March 4 fell on a Sunday, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5. This happened four times: in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917. In 1937, the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, moving the inauguration date to January 20, where it has remained since.\n\n**Dates**\n\nThe first inauguration, that of George Washington, took place on April 30, 1789.

Constitution in 1789 The exception to this pattern was those years in which March 4 fell on a Sunday When it did, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5 This happened on four occasions, in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917 Inauguration Day moved to January 20, beginning in 1937, following ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, where it has remained since A similar Sunday exception and move to Monday is made around this date as well (which happened in 1957, 1985, and 2013).\n\n\nLocations\nMost presidential inaugurations since 1801 have been held in Washington D.C at the Capitol Building Prior inaugurations were held, first at Federal Hall in New York City (1789), [5] and then at Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1793 and 1797) Each city was, at the time, the nation's capital The location for James Monroe's 1817 swearing in was moved to the Old Brick Capitol in Washington due to ongoing restoration work at the Capitol building following the War of 1812 [6]  Three other inaugurations—Franklin D Roosevelt's fourth (1945), Harry S Truman's first (1945), and Gerald Ford's (1974)—were held at the White House.\n\n\nOrganizers\nBefore Inauguration Day, the president-elect will name a Presidential Inaugural Committee This committee is the legal entity responsible for fundraising for and the planning and coordination of all official events and activities surrounding the inauguration of president and vice president (other than the ceremony), such as the balls and parade [11]\n\n\nAttendees\nIn addition to the public, the attendees at the inauguration generally include the vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, high-ranking military officers, former presidents and vice-presidents, living Medal of Honor recipients, and other dignitaries The outgoing president and vice president also customarily attend the ceremony.\n\n\nCommunication\nThe way inauguration ceremony events are communicated to the public has changed over the years with each advance in technology Improvements in mass media technologies have allowed presidents to reach substantially greater numbers of their constituents In 1829, Andrew Jackson spoke to approximately 10,000 people at his inauguration [18] Most recently, in 2017, it is estimated that about 160,000 people were in the National Mall areas in the hour leading up to Donald Trump's swearing in [19] An additional 30.6 million people in the United States watched it on television, [20] and more than 6.8 million worldwide streamed it live on Twitter [21] Among the inauguration mass communication milestones are: [22]\n\n\nCeremony elements\nInauguration procedure is governed by tradition rather than the Constitution, the only constitutionally required procedure being the presidential oath of office (which may be taken anywhere, with anyone in attendance who can legally witness an oath, and at any time prior to the actual beginning of the new president's term) [14] Traditionally, the president-elect arrives at the White House and then proceeds to the Capitol Building with the out-going president Around or after 12 noon, the president takes the oath of office, usually administered by the chief justice of the United States, and then delivers the inaugural address.\n\n\nOaths of office\nThe vice president is sworn into office in the same ceremony as the president Prior to 1937, the vice presidential oath was administered in the Senate Chamber (in keeping with the vice president's position as president of the Senate) The oath is administered to the vice president first Immediately afterwards, the United States Marine Band will perform four \"ruffles and flourishes\", followed by \"Hail, Columbia\" Unlike the presidential oath, however, the Constitution does not specify specific words that must be spoken Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789 The current form, which is also recited by senators, representatives, and other government officers, has been in use since 1884:\n\n\nInaugural address\nNewly sworn-in presidents usually give a speech referred to as an inaugural address As with many inaugural customs, this one was started by George Washington in 1789 After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall, he proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries Every president since Washington has delivered an inaugural address While many of the early presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the chief justice administer the oath first, followed by the president's speech [12] William McKinley requested the change in 1897, so that he could reiterate the words of the oath at the close of his first inaugural address.\n\n\nPrayers\nSince 1937, the ceremony has incorporated one or more prayers [39] [40]  Since 1933 an associated prayer service either public or private attended by the president-elect has often taken place on the morning of the day [41]  At times a major public or broadcast prayer service takes place after the main ceremony most recently on the next day [42]\n\n\nPoems\nSix inaugural ceremonies since 1961 have included a reading by a poet [43] The following poetry readings have taken place: \n\n\nOther elements\nOver the years, various inauguration traditions have arisen that have expanded the event from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long one, including parades, speeches, and balls In fact, contemporary inaugural celebrations typically span 10 days, from five days before the inauguration to five days after On some occasions however, either due to the preferences of the new president or to other constraining circumstances, they have been scaled back Such was the case in 1945, because of rationing in effect during World War II More recently, in 1973, the celebrations marking Richard Nixon's second inauguration were altered because of the death of former president Lyndon B Johnson two days after the ceremony All pending events were cancelled so preparations for Johnson's state funeral could begin Because of the construction work on the center steps of the East Front, Johnson's casket was taken up the Senate wing steps of the Capitol when taken into the rotunda to lie in state [50] When it was brought out, it came out through the House wing steps of the Capitol [50] In 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festivities were scaled back.\n\n\nCongressional luncheon\nSince 1953, the president and vice president have been guests of honor at a luncheon held by the leadership of the United States Congress immediately following the inaugural ceremony The luncheon is held in Statuary Hall and is organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, and attended by the leadership of both houses of Congress as well as guests of the president and vice president By tradition, the outgoing president and vice president will not attend In 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the luncheon was replaced by a gift-giving ceremony.\n\n\nInaugural parade\nFollowing the arrival of the presidential entourage to the White House, it is customary for the president, vice-president, their respective families and leading members of the government and military to review an inaugural parade from an enclosed stand at the edge of the North Lawn, a custom begun by James Garfield in 1881 The parade, which proceeds along 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the stand and the Front Lawn in view of the presidential party, features both military and civilian participants from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; this parade largely evolved from the post-inaugural procession to the White House, and occurred as far back as Jefferson's second inauguration in 1805, when workers from the Washington Navy Yard, accompanied by military music, marched with the president [51] on foot as he rode on horseback from the Capitol to the White House By the time of William Henry Harrison's inauguration in 1841, political clubs and marching societies would regularly travel to Washington for the parade That year was also the first in which floats were part of the parade It was at Lincoln's second inauguration, in 1865, that Native Americans and African Americans participated in the inaugural parade for the first time [52] Women were involved for the first time in 1917 [53]\n\n\nInterfaith national prayer service\nA tradition of an interfaith national prayer service, usually the day after the inauguration, dates back to George Washington and since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the prayer service has been held at the Washington National Cathedral [60] This is not the same as the Inaugural Prayer, a tradition also begun by Washington, when on June 1, 1789, Methodist bishops Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke, Rev John Dickins, the pastor of Old St George's (America's oldest Methodist Church) and Major Thomas Morrell, one of President Washington's former aides-de-camp called upon Washington in New York City [61] This tradition resumed in 1985 with President Reagan and continues under the auspices of a Presidential Inaugural Prayer Committee based at Old St George's.\n\n\nInaugural balls\nThe first Inaugural Ball was held on the night of James Madison's first inauguration in 1809 Tickets were $4 and it took place at Long's Hotel [53]\n\n\nSecurity\nThe security for the inaugural celebrations is a complex matter, involving the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service (DHS-FPS), all five branches of the Armed Forces, the Capitol Police, the United States Park Police (USPP), and the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) Federal law enforcement agencies also sometimes request assistance from various other state and local law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States.\n\n\nPresidential medals\nBeginning with George Washington, there has been a traditional association with Inauguration festivities and the production of a presidential medal With the District of Columbia attracting thousands of attendees for inauguration, presidential medals were an inexpensive souvenir for the tourists to remember the occasion However, the once-simple trinket turned into an official presidential election memento In 1901, the first Inauguration Committee [62] [failed verification] on Medals and Badges was established as part of the official Inauguration Committee for the re-election of President McKinley The Committee saw official medals as a way to raise funding for the festivities Gold medals were to be produced as gifts for the president, vice president, and committee chair; silver medals were to be created and distributed among Inauguration Committee members, and bronze medals would be for sale for public consumption McKinley's medal was simple with his portrait on one side and writing on the other side [63]\n\n\nList of inauguration ceremonies\nThe 59 inauguration ceremonies marking the start of a new four-year presidential term of office and also the nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president are listed in the table below.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nGraphical timeline of U.S. presidents\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born as Ville Pöyhönen, he has been active in the music industry since 2014, and has gained a significant following for his unique blend of punk rap and electronic music.\n\nMusical Career\n---------------\n\nPöyhönen grew up in the Ruskeasanta neighborhood of Vantaa, Greater Helsinki, as the son of Mikko and Arja Pöyhönen. He discovered his passion for music while learning to play the drums, and started producing music in 2014. His stage name, Käärijä, is derived from the phrase \"kääriä rahaa\", which translates to \"make a fast buck\", a reference to his hobby of gambling. Pöyhönen's early music was heavily influenced by punk rock and hip hop, which he incorporated into his unique sound.\n\nKäärijä's breakthrough came in 2020 with the release of his single \"Cha Cha Cha\", which became a viral hit in Finland and beyond. The song's catchy beat and energetic lyrics captured the attention of music fans worldwide, and it eventually led to his selection as Finland's representative in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023.\n\nOther Appearances in Eurovision\n-------------------------------\n\nIn addition to his performance in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, Käärijä made several other appearances in the event. In Malmö 2024, he appeared during the voting session of the 2nd Semi-Final and made a playthrough of a small portion of the single \"Cha Cha Cha\" after a performance of Ievan polkka. He was also set to read the votes from the Finnish Jury, but withdrew on the day of the Grand Final without stating a reason. It was later confirmed that he withdrew due to the disqualification of Dutch entrant Joost Klein earlier that day.\n\nArtistic Style and Influences\n-----------------------------\n\nPöyhönen's image as Käärijä started off with a bowl cut and a yellow suit, but during performances he would get too warm, remove the suit and perform mostly shirtless, which became a part of his brand. On social media, Pöyhönen uses the name \"Paidaton Riehuja\", which translates to \"shirtless rampager\", and is a reference to his punk rap song of the same title. He has expressed his belief that going topless should be acceptable regardless of body shape or size.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nPöyhönen has spoken about suffering from ulcerative colitis since his teenage years, culminating in emergency intestine removal surgery in 2014. The scar of the stoma he had to use for five months afterwards is still visible on his lower stomach. He has stated that he wants to be open about his experience with the disease, to encourage others to get checked for it.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\nStudio Albums:\n\n* [Album Title] (2020)\n* [Album Title] (2022)\n\nExtended Plays:\n\n* [EP Title] (2019)\n* [EP Title] (2021)\n\nSingles:\n\n* \"Cha Cha Cha\" (2020)\n* \"Paidaton Riehuja\" (2020)\n* \"Käärijä\" (2021)\n\nAwards and Nominations\n-----------------------\n\n* [Award Name] (2023)\n* [Award Name] (2022)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Käärijä\" following this outline:\n\n\nMusical career\nPöyhönen grew up in the Ruskeasanta neighbourhood of Vantaa, Greater Helsinki, as the son of Mikko and Arja Pöyhönen [5] [6] He discovered his passion for music while learning to play the drums, and started producing music in 2014 His stage name, owing to his gambling hobby, is derived from the phrase kääriä rahaa, \"make a fast buck\" [7] [8]\n\n\nOther appearances in Eurovision\nIn Malmö 2024, Käärijä appeared during the voting session of the 2nd Semi-Final and made a playthrough of a small portion of the single \"Cha Cha Cha\" after a performance of Ievan polkka [20] He was also set to read the votes from the Finnish Jury, but withdrew on the day of the Grand Final without stating a reason; a few days later it was confirmed he withdrew due to the disqualification of Dutch entrant Joost Klein earlier that day [21] [22]\n\n\nArtistic style and influences\nPöyhönen's image as Käärijä started off with a bowl cut and a yellow suit, but during performances he would get too warm, remove the suit and perform mostly shirtless, which became a part of his brand [23] [24] On social media Pöyhönen uses the name \"Paidaton Riehuja\", which translates to \"shirtless rampager\", and is a reference to his punk rap song of the same title He has expressed his belief that going topless should be acceptable regardless of body shape or size [25]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPöyhönen has spoken about suffering from ulcerative colitis since his teenage years, culminating in emergency intestine removal surgery in 2014 The scar of the stoma he had to use for five months afterwards is still visible on his lower stomach He has stated he wants to be open about his experience with the disease, to encourage others to get checked for it [23]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nExtended plays\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

he was named to every commission of the peace in Norfolk during the reign of Henry IV [63] During the 1400s, Erpingham's authority in north Norfolk was extended to other parts of the county and into Suffolk [63] Gentry from East Anglia who were associated with Erpingham benefited from his powerful position at court: Sir John Strange of Hunstanton became controller of the royal household in 1408; Sir Robert Gurney of Gunton became Erpingham's deputy at Dover Castle in 1400; and John Winter of Barningham became controller of Prince Henry's household in 1403 Other beneficiaries of Erpingham's friendship included Sir Ralph Shelton, John Payn, and John Raynes of Overstrand, who succeeded Payn as the constable of Norwich Castle in 1402 [64]\n\n\nCareer under Henry V\nHenry IV died at Westminster on 30 March 1413, and was succeeded by his son Henry of Monmouth, the Prince of Wales [67] Monmouth had replaced Erpingham as warden of the Cinque Ports in 1409, but relationships between the two men remained good, and after the coronation on 9 April 1413, [68] Erpingham was appointed steward of the household, a post he held until at least 1415 [69] [note 7] After Henry IV's reign, which had been marked by banditry and rioting, Henry V acted quickly to restore law and order throughout the country This was achieved within a year Henry's administrators—Erpingham included—were unusually talented, and order was maintained in England throughout his reign [71]\n\n\nParticipation at Harfleur and Agincourt\nErpingham crossed over from England to Normandy with Henry's army on 11 August 1415 The King's ship reached the mouth of the River Seine on 13 August, and the army landed 3 miles (5 km) from Harfleur, a landing point likely to have been decided on beforehand [76] Erpingham's men were present during the siege of the town, and on 22 September he led the procession to the walls and presided over the truce that led to its surrender [77] The English army then marched towards Calais, shadowed by the French, who forced them to divert away from the coast The English successfully forded the River Somme at Voyennes;

He played a significant role in the Wars of the Roses and was a key figure in the Battle of Agincourt. This article provides an overview of his life, career, and military service.\n\n## Ancestry and Early Life\n\nThomas Erpingham was born in about 1357 to Sir John de Erpingham, a member of the landed gentry, and his wife. His grandfather, Sir Robert de Erpingham, was a notable figure in Norfolk, representing the county in Parliament during the 1330s and 1340s. Thomas's family was associated with the Duchy of Lancaster, which would later play a significant role in his career.\n\n## Early Career\n\nErpingham's early career is not well-documented, but it is known that he served under William Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, in 1372 and accompanied him to France the following year. In 1379, he was part of the retinue of William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, who was the Captain of Calais. This experience would have provided Erpingham with valuable military training and exposure to the complexities of politics and diplomacy.\n\n## Revolution of 1399\n\nThe Revolution of 1399 saw the overthrow of King Richard II and the accession of Henry IV. Erpingham was a key figure in this transition, serving as a commissioner of peace and helping to maintain order in Norfolk after the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. He was also part of the commission that supervised the defense of Norfolk in 1385, when a French invasion seemed imminent.\n\n## Career under Henry IV\n\nHenry IV's coronation took place on October 13, 1399, and Erpingham played a significant role in the ceremony, carrying one of the King's swords during the procession. He was one of the 11 men who petitioned Henry to have Richard killed and later supervised the execution of two of the leading rebels, Sir Thomas Blount and Sir Benedict Kely. Erpingham's loyalty and service to Henry IV were rewarded, and he became one of the King's closest associates.\n\n## Power and Influence in Norfolk\n\nAfter 1399, Erpingham's influence in Norfolk shifted from Despenser to himself and his friends. His local connections, links with the Duchy of Lancaster, and position in the center of government made him a prominent figure in East Anglian society. He was named to every commission of the peace in Norfolk during Henry IV's reign and extended his authority to other parts of the county and into Suffolk.\n\n## Career under Henry V\n\nHenry V's accession to the throne in 1413 marked a new era in English history, and Erpingham continued to play a significant role in the country's politics and military affairs. He was appointed steward of the household, a post he held until at least 1415, and was part of the team that maintained order in England after a period of banditry and rioting.\n\n## Participation at Harfleur and Agincourt\n\nErpingham crossed over from England to Normandy with Henry's army in August 1415 and participated in the siege of Harfleur. He led the procession to the walls and presided over the truce that led to the town's surrender. The English army then marched towards Calais, shadowed by the French, who forced them to divert away from the coast. They successfully forded the River Somme at Voyennes, two days' march short of Calais, and were blocked by the French near Agincourt.\n\n## The Battle\n\nOn October 25, 1415, the day of the Battle of Agincourt, the English army was in position by dawn. Erpingham was given command of the archers, and the men-at-arms were positioned in the center of the gap between the two woods. The English army consisted of 5,000 archers and 800 dismounted men-at-arms, with the archers positioned on the flanks of the men-at-arms and a few hidden in a clearing in the Tramecourt woods.\n\n## Aftermath of the Battle\n\nAfter the Battle of Agincourt, Henry's army marched to the English enclave of the Pale of Calais, embarked from Calais on November 16, and returned to England. Erpingham was among the 300 men-at-arms and 900 archers who garrisoned the town over the winter. The seniority of the men-at-arms was a reflection of how important it was to Henry that the town was not lost to the French.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nWhen staying in Norwich, Erpingham and his family and servants lived in a large house located between Norwich Cathedral and the River Wensum. The house was acquired from Sir Robert Berney in 1409 and was known as \"Berney's Inn\" or \"the Erpingham\". It was a major source of employment for the local area during the time that it was occupied by Erpingham and was inherited by his niece.\n\n## Architectural Legacy\n\nErpingham was a benefactor to the city of Norwich, and his legacy can be seen in the cathedral gate that bears his name, opposite the west door of Norwich Cathedral leading into Cathedral Close. He also funded the rebuilding of the Church of the Blackfriars in Norwich after a fire in 1413.\n\n## Appearance in the Henriad\n\nSir Thomas Erpingham appears twice in Act IV of William Shakespeare's play Henry V, first printed in 1600. He is mentioned (but does not appear) in Act II of Richard II. According to the Shakespearean scholar Thomas M Cranfill, Erpingham plays a \"considerable, affecting role\".", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Thomas_Erpingham\" following this outline:\n\n\nAncestry and early life\nThomas Erpingham was born in about 1357, [2] the son of Sir John de Erpingham [3] of Erpingham and Wickmere in Norfolk, England [4] His grandfather, Sir Robert de Erpingham was recorded as holding Erpingham manor in 1316 [5] and Erpingham and Wickmere in 1346 [3] [6] [note 1] Sir Robert represented Norfolk in Parliaments during the 1330s and 1340s [3] [8] [9] In 1350, Sir Robert and his son Sir John de Erpingham both witnessed a deed of feoffment by Nicholas de Snyterle, rector of \"Matelask\" (Matlaske near Erpingham), to Philip Tynker and Maud his wife of a messuage there [10]\n\n\nEarly career\nErpingham served under William Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk in 1372 and was with Suffolk in France the following year In 1379 he was serving under the Captain of Calais, William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury In the summer of 1380 he was indentured into the retinue of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, a military leader and the third surviving son of Edward III of England, with whom Salisbury had recently served [12] Indentured retainers gave their allegiance for life in a personal written contract—conditions of service and payment were agreed, and these were rarely relaxed [14] [note 2]\n\n\nEarly military service\nErpingham served under William Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk in 1372 and was with Suffolk in France the following year In 1379 he was serving under the Captain of Calais, William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury In the summer of 1380 he was indentured into the retinue of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, a military leader and the third surviving son of Edward III of England, with whom Salisbury had recently served [12] Indentured retainers gave their allegiance for life in a personal written contract—conditions of service and payment were agreed, and these were rarely relaxed [14] [note 2]\n\n\nRevolution of 1399\nThe historian Helen Castor has described the Lancastrian presence in East Anglia as a \"disparate collection” that lacked coherence or a single identity [31] Erpingham rose to become the most important of Lancaster's retainers in the region [31] He was appointed to a commission of peace, and given powers to preserve order in Norfolk in the aftermath of the Peasants' Revolt in the summer of 1381 [32] He had a part in supervising the defence of Norfolk in 1385, when a French invasion seemed imminent [12] In 1396 Lancaster granted him the legal right to use the land within the hundred of South Erpingham, a reward for his loyal service to the Duchy of Lancaster [12] [33]\n\n\nCareer under Henry IV\nHenry's coronation took place on 13 October 1399 at Westminster Abbey As part of the ceremony, Erpingham carried one of the King's swords during the procession to the abbey [50] [53] He was one of 11 men who petitioned Henry in person to have Richard killed [50] [note 5] He was a commander in the army that suppressed the Epiphany Rising of 1399–1400, led by the duketti (the disparaging term given to a large group of noblemen, many of whom had received titles from Richard) [50] [55] Erpingham supervised the execution of two of the leading rebels, Sir Thomas Blount and Sir Benedict Kely As Blount watched his own bowels being burnt before him, he cursed Erpingham for being a \"false traitor\":\n\n\nPower and influence in Norfolk\nSir Thomas Erpingham was one of Henry IVs closest associates, [60] and after 1399, influence in Norfolk shifted from Despenser to Erpingham and his friends [61] Due to his local connections, his links with the Duchy of Lancaster and his position in the centre of government, [62] Erpingham held a prominent position in East Anglian society;

He is known for his unique and imaginative storytelling, often blending elements of fantasy, horror, and humor. With a career spanning over four decades, Burton has directed a wide range of films, from cult classics to blockbuster hits.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nTim Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California, the son of Jean Burton (née Erickson), who owned a cat-themed gift shop, and William \"Bill\" Burton, a former minor league baseball player. His father worked for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department, and the baseball field at Olive Recreation Center in Burbank, California, is named after him. Burton's early life was marked by a fascination with art, music, and filmmaking, which would later become the foundation of his career.\n\n**Career**\n\nBurton began his career in the animation industry, working as an animator, storyboard artist, graphic designer, art director, and concept artist on films such as The Fox and the Hound (1981), Tron (1982), and The Black Cauldron (1985). However, his concept art never made it into the finished films. This early experience would later influence his approach to filmmaking, allowing him to think creatively and outside the box.\n\n**1981–1987: Early Work and Breakthrough**\n\nBurton's early work was marked by experimentation and innovation. He developed a unique visual style, blending elements of fantasy and horror, which would become a hallmark of his career. His first film, Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), was a critical and commercial success, showcasing Burton's ability to balance humor and pathos. The film's success led to a collaboration with Paul Reubens, who would become a frequent collaborator throughout Burton's career.\n\n**1988–1994: Batman Films and Acclaim**\n\nBurton's breakthrough came with the release of Beetlejuice (1988), a supernatural comedy horror that grossed $80 million on a relatively low budget. The film's success was followed by Batman (1989), which grossed over $411 million worldwide and established Burton as a major force in the film industry. The film's success was marked by its dark and gothic visuals, which would become a signature element of Burton's style.\n\n**1995–2010: Established Director**\n\nBurton's success continued with the release of Edward Scissorhands (1990), a fairy tale romance that grossed over $56 million worldwide. The film's success was followed by Ed Wood (1994), a biographical drama that grossed over $5 million worldwide. Burton's work during this period was marked by a focus on character-driven storytelling and a willingness to take risks.\n\n**2011–2021: Career Fluctuations**\n\nBurton's career experienced a resurgence with the release of Alice in Wonderland (2010), a fantasy adventure that grossed over $1 billion worldwide. The film's success was followed by Dark Shadows (2012), a horror comedy that grossed over $245 million worldwide. Burton's work during this period was marked by a focus on visual spectacle and a willingness to experiment with new ideas.\n\n**2022–present: Wednesday and Resurgence**\n\nBurton's latest project is Wednesday, a series for Netflix based on the titular character from The Addams Family. The series, which premiered in November 2022, was a critical and commercial success, showcasing Burton's ability to balance humor and pathos. The series is a departure from Burton's previous work, marking a return to his roots in animation and comedy.\n\n**Unrealized Projects**\n\nBurton has been involved in several unrealized projects throughout his career, including a Superman film that was shelved due to budgetary concerns. The film, which was set to be released in 1998, was one of the most highly anticipated projects of the year, but was ultimately put on hold due to creative differences between Burton and the studio.\n\n**Frequent Collaborators**\n\nBurton has collaborated with several actors and filmmakers throughout his career, including Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Christopher Lee. His collaborations with Depp have been particularly notable, with the two actors starring in several films together, including Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Alice in Wonderland.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBurton has been married twice, first to Lena Gieseke, a German-born artist, and then to Lisa Marie, a model and actress. He has also been in a long-term relationship with Helena Bonham Carter, whom he met while filming Planet of the Apes. Burton's personal life has been marked by a focus on his career and his relationships, which have often been the subject of media attention.\n\n**Exhibitions and Books**\n\nBurton's work has been exhibited in several museums and galleries throughout his career, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne. His work has also been featured in several books, including a retrospective of his drawings and paintings.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985)\n* Beetlejuice (1988)\n* Batman (1989)\n* Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n* Batman Returns (1992)\n* Ed Wood (1994)\n* Mars Attacks!

Nightmares is a platform-adventure video game developed by Tarsier Studios and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in May 2017.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLittle Nightmares is a game that explores the \"wild extremes\" of childhood, set in a world where the player must navigate through a dark and eerie environment to survive. The game's setting, the Maw, is a massive, underwater iron vessel where the player must evade various enemies and obstacles to progress. With its unique blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and stealth gameplay, Little Nightmares has received critical acclaim for its atmospheric and haunting experience.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nLittle Nightmares takes place in a 3D world where the player encounters platforming situations and puzzles that must be solved to proceed. The player is generally rendered helpless in their environment due to the lack of any combat abilities, and must rely on stealth and the environment to hide from the various enemies. On a few occasions, the player is given tools that even the odds slightly and allow them to fight back.\n\nThroughout the game, the player controls Six, a nine-year-old girl in a yellow raincoat, as she navigates through the Maw. Six has the option to hug the Nomes, small, skittish creatures that either flee from her or passively observe her efforts. However, Six's hunger is a constant concern, and she must eat to sustain herself, which often leads to a shadowy, flickering version of herself appearing.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game's plot revolves around Six's journey through the Maw, a massive, underwater iron vessel where the player must evade various enemies and obstacles to progress. The player encounters Nomes, small, skittish creatures that either flee from her or passively observe her efforts. Six also encounters the Leeches, carnivorous creatures that infest the depths of the Prison, and the artificial eyes that will turn her to stone if she is caught in their lights.\n\nAs the player progresses through the game, Six is captured by the blind, long-armed Janitor, who supervises the captured children. However, Six manages to escape, but makes no effort to help the other children. The player then encounters the unseen monster moving underneath the room filled with piles of shoes, and eventually corners the Janitor, but severs his arms with a collapsing door.\n\n**DLC Plot**\n\nA trio of DLC levels that offer a \"different perspective on Six's adventures\" was planned. The first, titled \"The Depths,\" follows a boy called the Runaway Kid as he wakes up from a nightmare involving him swimming in darkness before being dragged underwater. The Runaway Kid follows a girl who is also fleeing, but later disappears, leaving behind a flashlight that the Runaway Kid takes.\n\nThe second, titled \"The Hideaway,\" sees the Runaway Kid breaking free from being wrapped in butcher paper and ascending on a hook towards the Kitchen.

its previous recipient was Louis Pasteur, who had died in 1895 [52] In 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium Mrs William Brown Meloney, after interviewing Curie, created a Marie Curie Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip [52] [65] [d]\n\n\nDeath\nCurie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934 [15] [77] A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anaemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to her bone marrow [52] [78]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries [85] Cornell University professor L Pearce Williams observes:\n\n\nCommemoration and cultural depictions\nAs one of the most famous scientists in history, Marie Curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of pop culture [87] She also received many honorary degrees from universities across the world [67]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nNonfiction\n\n\nFiction\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fedor_Emelianenko", "content": "\nEarly life\nEmelianenko was born in 1976 in the city of Rubizhne, Luhansk Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union [26] In 1978, when he was two, his family moved within the Soviet Union to Stary Oskol, Belgorod of the Russian SFSR [27] His mother, Olga Fedorovna, was a teacher, and his father, Vladimir Alexandrovich, was a welder [27]\n\n\nMixed martial arts career\nEmelianenko began his mixed martial arts as a member of Russian Top Team (RTT), [36] [37] a stable linked to Fighting Network RINGS where he trained under senior members like Volk Han and Andrei Kopylov After his bout with Gary Goodridge, the Emelianenko brothers left Russian Top Team and began to train in St Petersburg with Red Devil Sport Club, managed by Vadim Finkelchtein [37] Finkelchtein would remain his manager up until his first retirement in mid 2012 Emelianenko is also a member of the VOS gym in the Netherlands, where he trains with Johan Vos and Lucien Carbin  [citation needed] Emelianenko has trained with the likes of Ernesto Hoost, Tyrone Spong, and Denis Lebedev [38] [39] [40]\n\n\nClub affiliation\nEmelianenko began his mixed martial arts as a member of

mid 2012 Emelianenko is also a member of the VOS gym in the Netherlands, where he trains with Johan Vos and Lucien Carbin  [citation needed] Emelianenko has trained with the likes of Ernesto Hoost, Tyrone Spong, and Denis Lebedev [38] [39] [40]\n\n\n2000-2001: RINGS\nEmelianenko suffered his first loss in a controversial bout against Tsuyoshi Kohsaka at the King of Kings 2000 Block B event on 22 December 2000, via doctor stoppage due to a cut 17 seconds into the fight [41] Footage shows that the cut was caused by a missed looping punch where Kohsaka's elbow struck Emelianenko's head Emelianenko said that this elbow reopened a cut sustained in his previous fight against Ricardo Arona [42] The controversy surrounding the loss was due to the fact elbow strikes were illegal for the event.\n\n\n2002-2006: PRIDE Fighting Championships\nEntering the Pride Fighting Championships on the heels of winning the RINGS King of Kings 2002 tournament, Emelianenko debuted at Pride 21 on 23 June 2002 against the 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m), 256 lb (116 kg) Dutch fighter Semmy Schilt, whom he defeated by unanimous decision His next opponent was heavyweight Heath Herring, in a contest to establish the number-one heavyweight contender [45] Emelianenko, considered an underdog, dominated Herring with ground-and-pound, winning by doctor-stoppage after the first round [46]\n\n\nPRIDE Heavyweight Championship\nEmelianenko was then signed to fight heavily favored Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira for Pride's Heavyweight Championship title at Pride 25 on 16 March 2003 Nogueira was coming off wins against Mark Coleman, Heath Herring and an upset comeback victory against Bob Sapp, as well as victory in the RINGS 2000 King of Kings Tournament, in which Emelianenko had participated Nogueira was considered by many fans to be virtually unbeatable, due to his endurance and submission skills [37] Emelianenko rocked him early with punches and Nogueira pulled guard Emelianenko survived Nogueira's guard, considered the most dangerous in MMA and easily defended all of Nogueira's submission attempts, dominating him for 20 minutes with a brutal ground and pound The judges rendered a unanimous decision and Emelianenko became the second Pride Heavyweight Champion, a title he would never lose [47]\n\n\nPRIDE 2004 Heavyweight World Grand Prix\nA notable match with Coleman's protégé Kevin \"The Monster\" Randleman followed just two months later at the tournament's second round Randleman, a two-time Division I NCAA Wrestling Champion for Ohio State University and a former UFC Heavyweight Champion, was coming off an upset win over Mirko Cro Cop, which he ended by knockout Randleman quickly scored a takedown As Emelianenko gave his back, Randleman delivered a German suplex, slamming him to the canvas headfirst, a move that would become one of the most replayed highlights in PRIDE's and MMA's history for years to come [54] Emelianenko, seemingly unfazed, rolled over Randleman a few seconds later, getting top position and forcing him to submit with a kimura armlock 1:33 into the first round [55]\n\n\nTitle defense against Mirko Cro Cop\nThe match between Emelianenko and Cro Cop finally took place at PRIDE Final Conflict 2005 [59] [60] In the first round, Emelianenko was stunned and had his nose broken by two stiff jabs from Cro Cop He got hit by body kicks that discolored his midsection Emelianenko was then able to get the fight to the ground and land several body shots, which weakened his opponent As the fight progressed, Emelianenko became more and more dominant, winning most of the stand up exchanges and scoring several takedowns After 20 minutes, Emelianenko was awarded victory by unanimous decision [61] [62] [63]\n\n\nLater PRIDE years\nAlthough originally endangered due to Emelianenko's recurring hand injury, a plate inserted in his hand enabled a rematch with Coleman in Pride's American debut show, Pride 32 [64] [65] In a fight where Coleman was unable to mount any significant offense, Emelianenko pounded him in the first round with punches, before securing an armbar at 1:15 in the second round [66]\n\n\nM-1 Global\nAfter the purchase of Pride Fighting Championships by Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta III and the expiration of Emelianenko's Pride contract, there was speculation about him fighting in the UFC, especially after a public falling out between Bodog's Calvin Ayre and Emelianenko's manager, Vadim Finkelchtein [70] In a June 2007 interview with the Baltimore Sun, Chuck Liddell suggested that Emelianenko was on his way to the UFC [71] The following month, it was revealed that he was also a minority owner of M-1 Global [72] UFC president Dana White expressed interest in signing Emelianenko, but considered his management team to be the primary barrier, [73] whereas Finkelchtein cited difficult negotiations as the reason [74] A main point of contention between the two was Finkelchtein's request for the UFC to work with his Russian M-1 promotion, extending contractual offers to other members of the Red Devil Sport Club, and permitting Emelianenko to compete in combat sambo tournaments [70] At UFC 76, White stated that he expected Emelianenko to sign with the UFC in late 2007 or early 2008, after Emelianenko finished competing in sambo He revealed his intent to set up a unification bout with UFC heavyweight champion Randy Couture as his first UFC fight [75] Nevertheless, negotiations broke down, [76] as Emelianenko committed to a non-exclusive, two-year and six-fight deal with M-1 Global in October 2007 [77]\n\n\n2007: BodogFight and Yarennoka!\nWith a special clause in his Pride contract that allowed him to fight under the banner of any MMA organization as long as the event was held on Russian soil, [citation needed] Emelianenko accepted a match in BodogFight against Matt Lindland The fight was held on 14 April 2007 at the \"Clash of the Nations\" event in St Petersburg, Russia Lindland moved up two weight classes (from middleweight to heavyweight) for the match and came in weighing 212.5 lb (96.5 kg) to Emelianenko's 230 lb (104.5 kg) [78]\n\n\nNegotiations with DREAM\nOn 13 February 2008, Emelianenko attended a press conference held by Dream, a newly formed Japanese mixed martial arts promoter Vadim Finkelchtein confirmed that the organization had a tightly knit alliance with M-1 Global and that Emelianenko would be fighting on the new organization's fight cards [82] M-1 Global CEO Vadim Finkelchtein recently revealed plans to organize a fight for Fedor in co-operation with Dream, possibly on New Year's Eve in Japan [83]\n\n\n2008–2009: Affliction\nOn 19 July 2008, at Affliction: Banned, Emelianenko faced former two-time UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia Sylvia was coming off a submission loss via guillotine choke at the hands of Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira at UFC 81 in a title fight for the interim UFC Heavyweight Championship Sylvia was the fourth-ranked heavyweight fighter in MMA by Sherdog.com prior to his fight with Emelianenko [84]\n\n\nUnsuccessful negotiations with the UFC\nAfter the collapse of Affliction, UFC President Dana White tried repeatedly to sign Emelianenko to an exclusive UFC contract [97] White said of Emelianenko; \"He has become my obsession I want it (him in the UFC) worse than the fans want it.\" [98] Widely considered to be the best heavyweight MMA fighter at the time, Emelianenko would receive an immediate title shot against then current UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar, an event that White deemed \"huge\" [99] After reportedly offering Emelianenko a contract worth just under 2 million US dollars per fight, with incentives to make much more based on pay per view revenues for fights he headlined, [100] negotiations fell apart after Emelianenko's management team demanded a co-promotion between UFC and M-1 Global, terms which White deemed unacceptable [99] [100]\n\n\n2009–2011: Strikeforce\nFollowing the failed negotiations with the UFC, Emelianenko signed a three-fight contract with Strikeforce [103] Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker confirmed that Emelianenko's debut would take place on 7 November, broadcast nationally on CBS [104] [105]\n\n\n2011–2012: Return to Russia, Japan and retirement\nFollowing his stint in Strikeforce, Emelianenko fought Jeff Monson at M-1 Global on 20 November 2011 at the Olympic Arena in Moscow, Russia [115]\n\n\n2015: Coming out of retirement\nOn 14 July 2015, after a three year hiatus from mixed martial arts, Emelianenko announced that he will be returning to active competition and has started training immediately He was in negotiations with the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Bellator MMA In a statement released through his management, Emelianenko added that he has retired from his position at the Russian Ministry of Sport, and will put all attention toward his comeback [121]\n\n\n2016: Eurasia Fight Nights Global 50 fight versus Maldonado\nEmelianenko faced Fábio Maldonado on 17 June 2016 competing for a promotion on the regional circuit in St Petersburg (Russia) Despite being dropped and nearly finished in the first round, Emelianenko rallied over the last two rounds and was awarded a controversial majority decision victory [126] 4 of 5 media outlets scored the bout a draw [127] All three judges being appointed by the Russian MMA Union was pondered as a conflict of interest [128] In turn, in mid-July the official result was overturned to a draw [129] However, WMMAA has no real authority to change the outcome and its decision is merely symbolic in nature [130]\n\n\n2017–2023: Bellator MMA\nOn 19 November 2016, during the Bellator 165 broadcast it was announced that Emelianenko signed a multi-fight deal with Bellator MMA [133]\n\n\nCombat Sambo career\nEmelianenko competed in combat sambo both before (1998-2000) and during (2000-2012) his MMA career Before becoming a mixed martial artist he had already won several medals in competition, including bronze at both the 1998 and 2000 Russian Combat Sambo National Championships, gold at the 1998 Russian Armed Forces Championships, and gold at the 1999 European Combat Sambo Championships After beginning his MMA career and parallel with his MMA run before his first retirement, he became a seven-time national champion (2002, 2005,

He is widely considered one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time, holding the record for the longest-reigning heavyweight champion in the sport.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nFedor Emelianenko was born on September 28, 1976, in Rubizhne, Luhansk Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. In 1978, his family moved to Stary Oskol, Belgorod of the Russian SFSR. His mother, Olga Fedorovna, was a teacher, and his father, Vladimir Alexandrovich, was a welder.\n\nMixed Martial Arts Career\n-------------------------\n\nEmelianenko began his mixed martial arts career as a member of Russian Top Team (RTT), a stable linked to Fighting Network RINGS. He trained under senior members like Volk Han and Andrei Kopylov. After his bout with Gary Goodridge, Emelianenko left Russian Top Team and began to train in St Petersburg with Red Devil Sport Club, managed by Vadim Finkelchtein.\n\nEmelianenko has trained with the likes of Ernesto Hoost, Tyrone Spong, and Denis Lebedev. He is also a member of the VOS gym in the Netherlands, where he trains with Johan Vos and Lucien Carbin.\n\n2000-2001: RINGS\n---------------\n\nEmelianenko suffered his first loss in a controversial bout against Tsuyoshi Kohsaka at the King of Kings 2000 Block B event on December 22, 2000, via doctor stoppage due to a cut. Footage shows that the cut was caused by a missed looping punch where Kohsaka's elbow struck Emelianenko's head.\n\n2002-2006: PRIDE Fighting Championships\n--------------------------------------\n\nEmelianenko debuted at Pride 21 on June 23, 2002, against the 6'11\" Dutch fighter Semmy Schilt, whom he defeated by unanimous decision. His next opponent was heavyweight Heath Herring, in a contest to establish the number-one heavyweight contender. Emelianenko dominated Herring with ground-and-pound, winning by doctor-stoppage after the first round.\n\nPRIDE Heavyweight Championship\n---------------------------\n\nEmelianenko was then signed to fight heavily favored Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira for Pride's Heavyweight Championship title at Pride 25 on March 16, 2003. Nogueira was coming off wins against Mark Coleman, Heath Herring, and an upset comeback victory against Bob Sapp. Emelianenko rocked him early with punches and Nogueira pulled guard. Emelianenko survived Nogueira's guard, dominating him for 20 minutes with a brutal ground and pound. The judges rendered a unanimous decision, and Emelianenko became the second Pride Heavyweight Champion.\n\nPRIDE 2004 Heavyweight World Grand Prix\n--------------------------------------\n\nA notable match with Coleman's protégé Kevin \"The Monster\" Randleman followed just two months later at the tournament's second round. Randleman quickly scored a takedown, and Emelianenko gave his back. Randleman delivered a German suplex, slamming him to the canvas headfirst, a move that would become one of the most replayed highlights in PRIDE's and MMA's history. Emelianenko, seemingly unfazed, rolled over Randleman a few seconds later, getting top position and forcing him to submit with a kimura armlock 1:33 into the first round.\n\nTitle Defense against Mirko Cro Cop\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe match between Emelianenko and Cro Cop finally took place at PRIDE Final Conflict 2005. In the first round, Emelianenko was stunned and had his nose broken by two stiff jabs from Cro Cop. He got hit by body kicks that discolored his midsection. Emelianenko was then able to get the fight to the ground and land several body shots, which weakened his opponent. As the fight progressed, Emelianenko became more and more dominant, winning most of the stand-up exchanges and scoring several takedowns. After 20 minutes, Emelianenko was awarded victory by unanimous decision.\n\nLater PRIDE years\n-----------------\n\nAlthough originally endangered due to Emelianenko's recurring hand injury, a plate inserted in his hand enabled a rematch with Coleman in Pride's American debut show, Pride 32. In a fight where Coleman was unable to mount any significant offense, Emelianenko pounded him in the first round with punches, before securing an armbar at 1:15 in the second round.\n\nM-1 Global\n------------\n\nAfter the purchase of Pride Fighting Championships by Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta III and the expiration of Emelianenko's Pride contract, there was speculation about him fighting in the UFC. In a June 2007 interview with the Baltimore Sun, Chuck Liddell suggested that Emelianenko was on his way to the UFC. The following month, it was revealed that he was also a minority owner of M-1 Global.\n\n2007: BodogFight and Yarennoka!\n------------------------------\n\nWith a special clause in his Pride contract that allowed him to fight under the banner of any MMA organization as long as the event was held on Russian soil, Emelianenko accepted a match in BodogFight against Matt Lindland. The fight was held on April 14, 2007, at the \"Clash of the Nations\" event in St Petersburg, Russia. Lindland moved up two weight classes (from middleweight to heavyweight) for the match and came in weighing 212.5 pounds to Emelianenko's 230 pounds.\n\nNegotiations with DREAM\n----------------------\n\nOn February 13, 2008, Emelianenko attended a press conference held by DREAM, a newly formed Japanese mixed martial arts promoter. Vadim Finkelchtein confirmed that the organization had a tightly knit alliance with M-1 Global and that Emelianenko would be fighting on the new organization's fight cards.\n\n2008–2009: Affliction\n-----------------\n\nOn July 19, 2008, at Affliction: Banned, Emelianenko faced former two-time UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia. Sylvia was coming off a submission loss via guillotine choke at the hands of Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira at UFC 81 in a title fight for the interim UFC Heavyweight Championship. Emelianenko dominated Sylvia, winning by knockout in the first round.\n\nUnsuccessful negotiations with the UFC\n--------------------------------------\n\nAfter the collapse of Affliction, UFC President Dana White tried repeatedly to sign Emelianenko to an exclusive UFC contract. White said of Emelianenko; \"He has become my obsession I want it (him in the UFC) worse than the fans want it.\" Widely considered to be the best heavyweight MMA fighter at the time, Emelianenko would receive an immediate title shot against then-current UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar, an event that White deemed \"huge.\" After reportedly offering Emelianenko a contract worth just under 2 million US dollars per fight, with incentives to make much more based on pay per view revenues for fights he headlined, negotiations fell apart after Emelianenko's management team demanded a co-promotion between UFC and M-1 Global, terms which White deemed unacceptable.\n\n2009–2011: Strikeforce\n-----------------\n\nFollowing the failed negotiations with the UFC, Emelianenko signed a three-fight contract with Strikeforce. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker confirmed that Emelianenko's debut would take place on November 7, broadcast nationally on CBS.\n\n2011–2012: Return to Russia, Japan and retirement\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing his stint in Strikeforce, Emelianenko fought Jeff Monson at M-1 Global on November 20, 2011, at the Olympic Arena in Moscow, Russia.\n\n2015: Coming out of retirement\n-----------------------------\n\nOn July 14, 2015, after a three-year hiatus from mixed martial arts, Emelianenko announced that he will be returning to active competition and has started training immediately. He was in negotiations with the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Bellator MMA. In a statement released through his management, Emelianenko added that he has retired from his position at the Russian Ministry of Sport, and will put all attention toward his comeback.\n\n2016: Eurasia Fight Nights Global 50 fight versus Maldonado\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmelianenko faced Fábio Maldonado on June 17, 2016, competing for a promotion on the regional circuit in St Petersburg (Russia). Despite being dropped and nearly finished in the first round, Emelianenko rallied over the last two rounds and was awarded a controversial majority decision victory. 4 of 5 media outlets scored the bout a draw. All three judges being appointed by the Russian MMA Union was pondered as a conflict of interest. In turn, in mid-July the official result was overturned to a draw. However, WMMAA has no real authority to change the outcome and its decision is merely symbolic in nature.\n\n2017–2023: Bellator MMA\n----------------------\n\nOn November 19, 2016, during the Bellator 165 broadcast, it was announced that Emelianenko signed a multi-fight deal with Bellator MMA.\n\nCombat Sambo career\n-------------------\n\nEmelianenko competed in combat sambo both before (1998-2000) and during (2000-2012) his MMA career. Before becoming a mixed martial artist, he had already won several medals in competition, including bronze at both the 1998 and 2000 Russian Combat Sambo National Championships, gold at the 1998 Russian Armed Forces Championships, and gold at the 1999 European Combat Sambo Championships. After beginning his MMA career and parallel with his MMA run before his first retirement, he became a seven-time national champion (2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2008, 2009, 2012) and four-time world champion (2002, 2002, 2005, 2007) in combat sambo.\n\nLegacy and fighting style\n-------------------------\n\nSports Illustrated, among other publications, named Emelianenko as the top MMA fighter of the 2000s. Former combat sports fighters Chuck Norris and Mike Tyson; MMA fighters such as Junior dos Santos, Fabrício Werdum, Jose Aldo, Georges St-Pierre, Khabib Nurmagomedov; and several publications have called Emelianenko the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.

September 2024 [update] [47] [48] Election security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, may attempt to impede the voting process, or refuse to certify the 2024 results [49] The New York Times has reported that \"the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system\", by restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and preparing to mount \"legally dubious\" challenges against the certification process if Trump loses [50] In the lead up to the 2024 election, the Republican Party has made false claims of massive \"noncitizen voting\" by immigrants, in an attempt to delegitimize the election in the event of a Trump defeat [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nDonald Trump's false claims of interference\nTrump has made false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and has continued denying the election results as of September 2024 [update] [47] [48] Election security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, may attempt to impede the voting process, or refuse to certify the 2024 results [49] The New York Times has reported that \"the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system\", by

election, the Republican Party has made false claims of massive \"noncitizen voting\" by immigrants, in an attempt to delegitimize the election in the event of a Trump defeat [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nInterference by foreign nations\nBefore the election, current and former U.S officials stated that foreign interference in the 2024 election was likely Three major factors cited were \"America's deepening domestic political crises, the collapse of controversial attempts to control political speech on social media, and the rise of generative AI.\" [74] China, Russia, and Iran have since all been identified as mounting influence operations and attempts to interfere with the 2024 election US intelligence officials have described the efforts as part of broader efforts by authoritarian nations to use the internet to erode support for democracy [75]\n\n\nChina\nChina has been identified as interfering with the 2024 election through propaganda and disinformation campaigns linked to its Spamouflage operation US intelligence agencies described the effort as not targeting any particular candidate, but focusing on issues important to Beijing such as Taiwan, and \"undermining confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S in general.\" [75] As early as April 1, 2024, The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had created fake pro-Trump accounts on social media \"promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November.\" [76]\n\n\nRussia\nAccording to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies, Russia spread disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Biden and Democrats, boost candidates supporting isolationism, and undercut support for Ukraine aid and NATO [77] [78] On September 4, 2024, the United States publicly accused Russia of interfering in the 2024 election and announced several steps to combat Russian influence including sanctions, indictments, and seizing of web domains used to spread propaganda and disinformation American intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia prefers Trump to win the election, viewing him as more critical of U.S support for Ukraine [79]\n\n\nIran\nIran has been identified as interfering with the 2024 presidential election through front companies connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps through hacking attempts against the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns starting as early as May 2024 [80] Iran has launched propaganda and disinformation campaigns through fake news websites and accounts on social media to tip the election against former president Trump, although it has also targeted both Biden and Harris The New York Times stated the efforts were an attempt at \"sowing internal discord and discrediting the democratic system in the United States more broadly in the eyes of the world.\" [81] [80] [82]\n\n\nCriminal trials and indictments against Donald Trump\nTrump has been found liable in civil proceedings for both sexual abuse and defamation in 2023 and defamation in 2024, while also being criminally convicted of 34 felonies related to falsifying business records, expected to be an issue during the campaign He has four criminal indictments totaling 91 felony counts and there are other lawsuits against Trump [83] On May 30, Trump was found guilty by a jury of all 34 felony counts in The People of the State of New York v Donald J Trump over falsifying business records for hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter between them, to influence the 2016 presidential election This makes Trump the first former U.S president to be convicted of a crime in American history [84] Trump and many Republicans have made numerous false and misleading statements regarding Trump's criminal trials, including false claims that they are \"rigged\" or \"election interference\" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party, of which there is no evidence [85] [46]\n\n\nAge and health concerns\nFormer president Trump and mass media [who?] raised concerns about President Biden's age, including his cognitive state, during and after the 2020 United States presidential election These concerns increased after a poor performance by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election, which led a number of commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race [109] He later withdrew his candidacy while stating that he would continue serving as president until the conclusion of his term [110]\n\n\nJoe Biden\nFormer president Trump and mass media [who?] raised concerns about President Biden's age, including his cognitive state, during and after the 2020 United States presidential election These concerns increased after a poor performance by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election, which led a number of commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race [109] He later withdrew his candidacy while stating that he would continue serving as president until the conclusion of his term [110]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nAccording to polling released in July and August, a majority of voters polled after the first debate think Trump is too old to serve a second term (51%, [114] 57%, [115] and 60% [116]), with 80% unsure he would be able to finish out a second term [114] During and after Trump's presidency, comments on his age, weight, lifestyle and history of heart disease have raised questions about his physical health [117] In addition, numerous public figures, media sources, and mental health professionals have speculated that Trump may have some form of dementia, which runs in his family [117] Experts for the science publication STAT who analyzed changes in Trump's speeches between 2015 and 2024 noted shorter sentences, more tangents, more repetition and more confusion of words and phrases The doctors suggested it could just be due to changes in mood or it could indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's [118] The sharp rise in all-or-nothing thinking is also linked to cognitive decline [118] The New York Times reported that Trump's 2024 speeches had grown \"darker, harsher, longer, angrier, less focused, more profane and increasingly fixated on the past\" and that experts considered this increase in tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition as a possible consequence of advancing age and cognitive decline [119] Trump has also been criticized for his lack of transparency around his medical records and health [120] [117]\n\n\nPolitical violence and threats\nSeveral scholars, lawmakers, intelligence agencies, and the members of the public have expressed concerns about political violence surrounding the 2024 election [127] [128] The fears come amidst increasing threats and acts of physical violence targeting public officials and election workers at all levels of government [129] [130] Trump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in America both for and against him [131] [132] [133] Political violence is at its highest since the 1970s, and most recent violence has come from right-wing assailants [134] [135] Trump has increasingly embraced far-right extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president [11] [12] Trump has espoused dehumanizing, combative, and violent rhetoric and promised retribution against his political enemies [c] Trump has played down but refused to rule out violence following the 2024 election, stating \"it depends\" [142] Trump has suggested using the military against \"the enemy from within\" on Election Day that he described as \"radical left lunatics\", Democratic politicians, and those who oppose his candidacy [143] [15]\n\n\nAssassination attempts\nOn July 13, 2024, Trump survived an assassination attempt while addressing a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania [19] Trump was shot and wounded on his right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, [144] [145] who fired eight rounds with an AR-15–style rifle from the roof of a building located approximately 400 feet (120 meters) from the stage; the shots killed audience member Corey Comperatore and critically injured two other audience members [144] Seconds later, Crooks was shot and killed by the U.S Secret Service's counter-sniper team [146] The motive and cause of the assassination attempt are still under investigation by authorities [147] On September 11, 2024, a bipartisan Senate report identified tech issues and other preventable mistakes by the Secret Service during the event [148]\n\n\nElection workers and ballot boxes\nSince the 2020 election and continuing into the 2024 election, the election denial movement in the United States has prompted thousands of death threats directed at election workers, officials, and their families, with some receiving letters laced with fentanyl [151] [152] As of March 2024, the Department of Justice's Election Threats Task Force had charged 20 people with threat-related crimes [153] In September 2024, suspicious packages were sent to state election officials in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Wyoming This resulted in evacuations in several states The inclusion of white powder in most of the packages mirrored the 2001 anthrax attacks, but the substance in the Oklahoma delivery was identified as flour [154] Threats have led some election workers to resign and have affected recruitment of temporary poll workers [155] [156] Efforts to protect election workers are diverse, including active shooter drills, provision of trauma kits and Narcan, and the use of bullet-proof vests, bullet-resistant glass, metal detectors, various kinds of barriers, armed guards, police snipers, drones, and security cameras [155] However, many boards of election lack the funds for such efforts [156]\n\n\nElectoral map\nThis will be the first presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census [159] [160] If the state results of 2020 were to stay the same in 2024, which has never occurred before, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans' 235, a slight change from Biden's 306 and Trump's 232, meaning Democrats lost a net 3 electoral votes to reapportionment This apportionment will remain through the 2028 election Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 census [161]\n\n\nEffects of the 2020 census\nThis will be the first presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census [159] [160] If the state results of 2020 were to stay the same in 2024, which has never occurred before, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans' 235, a slight change from Biden's 306 and Trump's 232, meaning Democrats lost a net 3 electoral votes to reapportionment This apportionment will remain through the 2028 election Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 census [161]\n\n\nSwing states\nMost states are not competitive because demographics keep them solidly behind a party Because of the nature of the Electoral College, this means a limited number of swing states—competitive states that \"swing\" between the parties—are vital to winning the presidency These are the Rust Belt states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania; and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina [20]\n\n\nCampaign issues\nHarris has framed her campaign as \"a choice between freedom and chaos\" and based it around the ideals of \"freedom\" and \"the future\" [173] [174] The Harris campaign has sought to highlight her experience as an attorney general and a prosecutor to \"prosecute the case\" against Trump by pointing out his 34 felony convictions and the impacts of the overturning of Roe v Wade [175] [176] Harris is running as a moderate Democrat who has moved towards the center on several policy positions since her 2019 primary run, embracing many of Biden's domestic policy stances [177] Harris has focused her economic proposals on the cost of groceries, housing and healthcare [178] She has also focused on the middle class, and small businesses [179] Harris' campaign has been noted for having an optimistic and joyful tone [180] [181]\n\n\nCampaign themes\nHarris has framed her campaign as \"a choice between freedom and chaos\" and based it around the ideals of \"freedom\" and \"the future\" [173] [174] The Harris campaign has sought to highlight her experience as an attorney general and a prosecutor to \"prosecute

optimistic and joyful tone [180] [181]\n\n\nTrump campaign\nA central campaign theme for Trump's second presidential bid is \"retribution\" [182] [183] Trump announced the theme during his March 2023 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), stating \"In 2016, I declared, 'I am your voice.' Today, I add: I am your warrior I am your justice And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution I am your retribution.\" Trump framed the 2024 election as \"the final battle,\" and openly promised to leverage the power of the presidency for political reprisals, [184] though he has also stated his retribution \"will be success\" [185] Trump is heavily running on immigration as a central campaign focus Trump's campaign has focused on dark and apocalyptic rhetoric about the state of the country and predicting doom if he does not win [186] [187] [188] [189] The Associated Press states that \"Trump's rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric and agenda of Christian nationalism.\" [190] During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has made numerous false and misleading statements [7] [8] [9] The large number of lies and false statements have been attributed to Trump's rhetorical style described as using the big lie and firehose of falsehood propaganda technique [191] [192] Trump has also made many personal attacks against Harris, [193] several of which are sexual in nature, [17] viewed as racist and misogynistic, [194] [195] [196] and considered a continued breaking of norms regarding political speech [17] Trump's harsher rhetoric against his political enemies has been described by historians, scholars, commentators and former generals as populist, authoritarian, fascist, [d] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history [14] [209] [16] Harris characterized Trump as a fascist during a live television appearance on October 23, [210] and Trump has called Harris a fascist during rallies throughout his 2024 campaign [206]\n\n\nAbortion\nAbortion access is a key topic during the campaign [211] [24] This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, leaving abortion law entirely to the states, including bans on abortion [212] The three justices appointed by former president Trump—Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch—all voted to overturn the federal right to an abortion in Dobbs [213] By April 2023, most Republican-controlled states had passed near-total bans on abortion, rendering it largely illegal throughout much of the southern United States According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 15 states that have de jure early-stage bans on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest [212]\n\n\nBorder security and immigration\nBorder security and immigration are among the top issues concerning potential voters in the election [230] [231] Polling has shown that most Americans want to reduce immigration [232] and that a substantial minority of white Republicans are concerned about white demographic decline [233] In 2023 and early 2024, a surge of migrants entering through the border with Mexico occurred [234] By June 2024, illegal crossings reached a three-year low following four consecutive monthly drops, which senior officials attributed to increased enforcement between the US and Mexico, the weather, and Biden's executive order increasing asylum restrictions [235]\n\n\nClimate change\nClimate change is expected to be an issue in the 2024 presidential election [26] [27] In 2023, the United States saw a record in crude oil production with over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day beating the 13 million barrels per day produced at the peak of Trump's presidency [271] America also dealt with supply shocks caused by the 2021–2024 global energy crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine [272]\n\n\nDemocracy\nPolling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the state of American democracy [285] [286] [287] Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with Christian nationalist autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election [288] According to an October 25 ABC/Ipsos poll, half of Americans see Trump as a fascist, described as \"a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.\" Meanwhile, only 22% saw Harris as a fascist by this definition [289] Some Republicans are concerned that Trump's former impeachment and four criminal indictments are attempts to influence the election and keep him from office [290] However, there is no evidence that Trump's criminal trials are \"election interference\" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party [85] [46] Trump has repeated false claims that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen from him [13]\n\n\nEconomic issues\nVoters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024 election [318] Following the COVID-19 pandemic, America went through a surge in inflation that raised prices on many goods, though the inflation rate had declined significantly during 2023 and 2024 [319] [320] [321] The New York Times reported that both candidates \"embraced a vision of a powerful federal government, using its muscle to intervene in markets in pursuit of a stronger and more prosperous economy.\" [322] The Wall Street Journal reported that economists found Trump's proposed policies created a greater risk of stoking inflation and generating higher budget deficits, relative to the Harris plan [323] Twenty-three Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter characterizing the Harris economic plan as \"vastly superior\" to the Trump plan [324]\n\n\nEducation\nTrump has pledged to terminate the Department of Education, [282] [361] [362] claiming it has been infiltrated by \"radical zealots and Marxists.\" [363] At the American Federation of Teachers national convention, Harris attacked recent efforts to ban books [364] She has also previously called for raising teacher's wages [365]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israel–Hamas war are expected issues in the election [366] Harris has signaled to generally follow Biden's foreign policy on NATO and Ukraine, supporting both in the aftermath of the Russian invasion [221] [367] A supporter of the two-state solution, [221] [368] Harris is seen as more sympathetic to Palestinians than Biden, who has described himself as a Zionist and has a long history with Israeli leaders [367] Regarding the Israel–Hamas war, analysts expect Harris to continue Biden's approach [369] Following Hamas's attack on Israel in 2023, Harris strongly supported Israel's offensive, [370] [369] stating that \"the threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel must be eliminated\" [221] However, she has since criticized Israel's approach and the Gaza humanitarian crisis [367] In March 2024, Harris opposed Israel's invasion of Rafah, [221] called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, [369] [221] and stated that the situation in Gaza is a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" [221] Harris has advocated for \"de-risking\" from Beijing, a policy that encourages reducing Western economic dependence on China [371] Harris is expected to continue deepening American alliances in Asia and the Pacific with the intention of curbing China's rising power both economically and militarily [372]\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas war views\nPolling has indicated that the majority of voters support a ceasefire and American mediation in the Israel-Hamas war [387] According to a YouGov poll in March 2024, 52% of Americans supported stopping weapons shipments to Israel, coming largely from Americans who voted for Biden in 2020 (62% support) and people who did not vote in 2020 (60%) Republicans opposed halting weapons shipments by 25 points [388] Republicans generally support arms to Israel, while Democrats are divided on the issue [389]\n\n\nHealthcare issues\nThe issue of healthcare, drug policy, and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to play a key role in the 2024 presidential election [397] [398]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn recent years, conservative politicians in state legislatures have introduced a growing number of bills that Democrats say restrict the rights of LGBT people, especially transgender people [404] [405]\n\n\nDemocratic Party\nOn April 25, 2023, President Biden officially announced his bid for re-election, confirming that Vice

Trump agreed to debates on CNN on June 27 and ABC News on September 10 [508] The Harris camp suggested that another debate could be held in October after the September 10 debate with Trump [509]\nOn

take place on November 5, 2024. It will be the 59th presidential election in U.S. history, with the winner of the election set to assume the presidency on January 20, 2025.\n\n# Background\n\nThe presidential election process in the United States is governed by Article Two of the United States Constitution, which sets out the eligibility requirements for the presidency. To be eligible to serve as president, an individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a U.S. resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution prohibits any person from being elected president more than twice.\n\n## Article Two of the United States Constitution\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice.\n\n## Major Party Candidates\n\nMajor party candidates seek the nomination through a series of primary elections that select the delegates who choose the candidate at the party's national convention. Each party's national convention chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket. The nominee for president usually picks the running mate, who is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention.\n\n## Election Interference\n\nElection security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election may attempt to impede the voting process or refuse to certify the 2024 results. The New York Times has reported that \"the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system\" by restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and preparing to mount \"legally dubious\" challenges against the certification process if Trump loses.\n\n## Foreign Interference\n\nBefore the election, current and former U.S officials stated that foreign interference in the 2024 election was likely. Three major factors cited were \"America's deepening domestic political crises, the collapse of controversial attempts to control political speech on social media, and the rise of generative AI.\" China, Russia, and Iran have been identified as mounting influence operations and attempts to interfere with the 2024 election.\n\n## Chinese Interference\n\nChina has been identified as interfering with the 2024 election through propaganda and disinformation campaigns linked to its Spamouflage operation. U.S intelligence agencies described the effort as not targeting any particular candidate, but focusing on issues important to Beijing, such as Taiwan, and \"undermining confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S in general.\"\n\n## Russian Interference\n\nAccording to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies, Russia spread disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Biden and Democrats, boost candidates supporting isolationism, and undercut support for Ukraine aid and NATO. On September 4, 2024, the United States publicly accused Russia of interfering in the 2024 election and announced several steps to combat Russian influence, including sanctions, indictments, and seizing of web domains used to spread propaganda and disinformation.\n\n## Iranian Interference\n\nIran has been identified as interfering with the 2024 presidential election through front companies connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps through hacking attempts against the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns starting as early as May 2024. Iran has launched propaganda and disinformation campaigns through fake news websites and accounts on social media to tip the election against former president Trump, although it has also targeted both Biden and Harris.\n\n## Abortion\n\nAbortion access is a key topic during the campaign. This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, leaving abortion law entirely to the states, including bans on abortion.\n\n## Border Security and Immigration\n\nBorder security and immigration are among the top issues concerning potential voters in the election. Polling has shown that most Americans want to reduce immigration, and a substantial minority of white Republicans are concerned about white demographic decline.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change is expected to be an issue in the 2024 presidential election. In 2023, the United States saw a record in crude oil production with over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day beating the 13 million barrels per day produced at the peak of Trump's presidency.\n\n## Democracy\n\nPolling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the state of American democracy. Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with Christian nationalist autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n## Economic Issues\n\nVoters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024 election. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, America went through a surge in inflation that raised prices on many goods, though the inflation rate had declined significantly during 2023 and 2024.\n\n## Foreign Policy\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israel–Hamas war are expected issues in the election. Harris has signaled to generally follow Biden's foreign policy on NATO and Ukraine, supporting both in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.\n\n## Healthcare Issues\n\nThe issue of healthcare, drug policy, and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to play a key role in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n## LGBT Rights\n\nIn recent years, conservative politicians in state legislatures have introduced a growing number of bills that Democrats say restrict the rights of LGBT people, especially transgender people.\n\n# Campaign Issues\n\n## Democratic Party\n\nOn April 25, 2023, President Biden officially announced his bid for re-election, confirming that Vice President Harris would remain his running mate. Following this announcement, Republicans increased their focus on Harris, intensifying criticism against her.\n\n## Republican Party\n\nTrump, the then-incumbent president, was defeated by Biden in the 2020 election and is not term-limited to run again in 2024. Trump filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on November 15, 2022, and announced his candidacy in a speech at Mar-a-Lago the same day.\n\n## Libertarian Party\n\nChase Oliver was chosen by the Libertarian Party as its presidential nominee on May 26, 2024, at the 2024 Libertarian National Convention. Oliver was the party's candidate in the 2022 United States Senate election in Georgia.\n\n## Green Party\n\nJill Stein was also the party's candidate in 2012 and 2016. Stein is a physician and a former member of the Lexington Town Meeting. On August 16, Stein selected academic Butch Ware as her running mate.\n\n# Debates\n\n## June 27 Presidential Debate: Biden vs. Trump\n\nCNN hosted the first major debate of the election on June 27 in Atlanta, with 51 million viewers watching. Media outlets characterized Biden's debate performance as a \"disaster.\" Some pundits noted that he frequently lost his train of thought and gave meandering, confused answers.\n\n## September 10 Presidential Debate: Harris vs. Trump\n\nThe second presidential debate was held on Tuesday, September 10 by ABC News with 67.1 million viewers watching. Trump had proposed a debate on Fox News instead of the ABC debate, but later accepted the debate on ABC.

interference in the 2024 election was likely Three major factors cited were \"America's deepening domestic political crises, the collapse of controversial attempts to control political speech on social media, and the rise of generative AI.\" [74] China, Russia, and Iran have since all been identified as mounting influence operations and attempts to interfere with the 2024 election US intelligence officials have described the efforts as part of broader efforts by authoritarian nations to use the internet to erode support for democracy [75]\n\n\nChina\nChina has been identified as interfering with the 2024 election through propaganda and disinformation campaigns linked to its Spamouflage operation US intelligence agencies described the effort as not targeting any particular candidate, but focusing on issues important to Beijing such as Taiwan, and \"undermining confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S in general.\" [75] As early as April 1, 2024, The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had created fake pro-Trump accounts on social media \"promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November.\" [76]\n\n\nRussia\nAccording to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies, Russia spread disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Biden and Democrats, boost candidates supporting isolationism, and undercut support for Ukraine aid and NATO [77] [78] On September 4, 2024, the United States publicly accused Russia of interfering in the 2024 election and announced several steps to combat Russian influence including sanctions, indictments, and seizing of web domains used to spread propaganda and disinformation American intelligence agencies have assessed that Russia prefers Trump to win the election, viewing him as more critical of U.S support for Ukraine [79]\n\n\nIran\nIran has been identified as interfering with the 2024 presidential election through front companies connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps through hacking attempts against the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns starting as early as May 2024 [80] Iran has launched propaganda and disinformation campaigns through fake news websites and accounts on social media to tip the election against former president Trump, although it has also targeted both Biden and Harris The New York Times stated the efforts were an attempt at \"sowing internal discord and discrediting the democratic system in the United States more broadly in the eyes of the world.\" [81] [80] [82]\n\n\nCriminal trials and indictments against Donald Trump\nTrump has been found liable in civil proceedings for both sexual abuse and defamation in 2023 and defamation in 2024, while also being criminally convicted of 34 felonies related to falsifying business records, expected to be an issue during the campaign He has four criminal indictments totaling 91 felony counts and there are other lawsuits against Trump [83] On May 30, Trump was found guilty by a jury of all 34 felony counts in The People of the State of New York v Donald J Trump over falsifying business records for hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels, to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter between them, to influence the 2016 presidential election This makes Trump the first former U.S president to be convicted of a crime in American history [84] Trump and many Republicans have made numerous false and misleading statements regarding Trump's criminal trials, including false claims that they are \"rigged\" or \"election interference\" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party, of which there is no evidence [85] [46]\n\n\nAge and health concerns\nFormer president Trump and mass media [who?] raised concerns about President Biden's age, including his cognitive state, during and after the 2020 United States presidential election These concerns increased after a poor performance by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election, which led a number of commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race [109] He later withdrew his candidacy while stating that he would continue serving as president until the conclusion of his term [110]\n\n\nJoe Biden\nFormer president Trump and mass media [who?] raised concerns about President Biden's age, including his cognitive state, during and after the 2020 United States presidential election These concerns increased after a poor performance by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election, which led a number of commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race [109] He later withdrew his candidacy while stating that he would continue serving as president until the conclusion of his term [110]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nAccording to polling released in July and August, a majority of voters polled after the first debate think Trump is too old to serve a second term (51%, [114] 57%, [115] and 60% [116]), with 80% unsure he would be able to finish out a second term [114] During and after Trump's presidency, comments on his age, weight, lifestyle and history of heart disease have raised questions about his physical health [117] In addition, numerous public figures, media sources, and mental health professionals have speculated that Trump may have some form of dementia, which runs in his family [117] Experts for the science publication STAT who analyzed changes in Trump's speeches between 2015 and 2024 noted shorter sentences, more tangents, more repetition and more confusion of words and phrases The doctors suggested it could just be due to changes in mood or it could indicate the beginning of Alzheimer's [118] The sharp rise in all-or-nothing thinking is also linked to cognitive decline [118] The New York Times reported that Trump's 2024 speeches had grown \"darker, harsher, longer, angrier, less focused, more profane and increasingly fixated on the past\" and that experts considered this increase in tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition as a possible consequence of advancing age and cognitive decline [119] Trump has also been criticized for his lack of transparency around his medical records and health [120] [117]\n\n\nPolitical violence and threats\nSeveral scholars, lawmakers, intelligence agencies, and the members of the public have expressed concerns about political violence surrounding the 2024 election [127] [128] The fears come amidst increasing threats and acts of physical violence targeting public officials and election workers at all levels of government [129] [130] Trump has been identified as a key figure in increasing political violence in America both for and against him [131] [132] [133] Political violence is at its highest since the 1970s, and most recent violence has come from right-wing assailants [134] [135] Trump has increasingly embraced far-right extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon, and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American president [11] [12] Trump has espoused dehumanizing, combative, and violent rhetoric and promised retribution against his political enemies [c] Trump has played down but refused to rule out violence following the 2024 election, stating \"it depends\" [142] Trump has suggested using the military against \"the enemy from within\" on Election Day that he described as \"radical left lunatics\", Democratic politicians, and those who oppose his candidacy [143] [15]\n\n\nAssassination attempts\nOn July 13, 2024, Trump survived an assassination attempt while addressing a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania [19] Trump was shot and wounded on his right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, [144] [145] who fired eight rounds with an AR-15–style rifle from the roof of a building located approximately 400 feet (120 meters) from the stage; the shots killed audience member Corey Comperatore and critically injured two other audience members [144] Seconds later, Crooks was shot and killed by the U.S Secret Service's counter-sniper team [146] The motive and cause of the assassination attempt are still under investigation by authorities [147] On September 11, 2024, a bipartisan Senate report identified tech issues and other preventable mistakes by the Secret Service during the event [148]\n\n\nElection workers and ballot boxes\nSince the 2020 election and continuing into the 2024 election, the election denial movement in the United States has prompted thousands of death threats directed at election workers, officials, and their families, with some receiving letters laced with fentanyl [151] [152] As of March 2024, the Department of Justice's Election Threats Task Force had charged 20 people with threat-related crimes [153] In September 2024, suspicious packages were sent to state election officials in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Wyoming This resulted in evacuations in several states The inclusion of white powder in most of the packages mirrored the 2001 anthrax attacks, but the substance in the Oklahoma delivery was identified as flour [154] Threats have led some election workers to resign and have affected recruitment of temporary poll workers [155] [156] Efforts to protect election workers are diverse, including active shooter drills, provision of trauma kits and Narcan, and the use of bullet-proof vests, bullet-resistant glass, metal detectors, various kinds of barriers, armed guards, police snipers, drones, and security cameras [155] However, many boards of election lack the funds for such efforts [156]\n\n\nElectoral map\nThis will be the first presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census [159] [160] If the state results of 2020 were to stay the same in 2024, which has never occurred before, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans' 235, a slight change from Biden's 306 and Trump's 232, meaning Democrats lost a net 3 electoral votes to reapportionment This apportionment will remain through the 2028 election Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 census [161]\n\n\nEffects of the 2020 census\nThis will be the first presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census [159] [160] If the state results of 2020 were to stay the same in 2024, which has never occurred before, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans' 235, a slight change from Biden's 306 and Trump's 232, meaning Democrats lost a net 3 electoral votes to reapportionment This apportionment will remain through the 2028 election Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 census [161]\n\n\nSwing states\nMost states are not competitive because demographics keep them solidly behind a party Because of the nature of the Electoral College, this means a limited number of swing states—competitive states that \"swing\" between the parties—are vital to winning the presidency These are the Rust Belt states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania; and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina [20]\n\n\nCampaign issues\nHarris has framed her campaign as \"a choice between freedom and chaos\" and based it around the ideals of \"freedom\" and \"the future\" [173] [174] The Harris campaign has sought to highlight her experience as an attorney general and a prosecutor to \"prosecute the case\" against Trump by pointing out his 34 felony convictions and the impacts of the overturning of Roe v Wade [175] [176] Harris is running as a moderate Democrat who has moved towards the center on several policy positions since her 2019 primary run, embracing many of Biden's domestic policy stances [177] Harris has focused her economic proposals on the cost of groceries, housing and healthcare [178] She has also focused on the middle class, and small businesses [179] Harris' campaign has been noted for having an optimistic and joyful tone [180] [181]\n\n\nCampaign themes\nHarris has framed her campaign as \"a choice between freedom and chaos\" and based it around the ideals of \"freedom\" and \"the future\" [173] [174] The Harris campaign has sought to highlight her experience as an attorney general and a prosecutor to \"prosecute the case\" against Trump by pointing out his 34 felony convictions and the impacts of the overturning of Roe v Wade [175] [176] Harris is running as a moderate Democrat who has moved towards the center on several policy positions since her 2019 primary run, embracing many of Biden's domestic policy stances [177]

and small businesses [179] Harris' campaign has been noted for having an optimistic and joyful tone [180] [181]\n\n\nTrump campaign\nA central campaign theme for Trump's second presidential bid is \"retribution\" [182] [183] Trump announced the theme during his March 2023 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), stating \"In 2016, I declared, 'I am your voice.' Today, I add: I am your warrior I am your justice And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution I am your retribution.\" Trump framed the 2024 election as \"the final battle,\" and openly promised to leverage the power of the presidency for political reprisals, [184] though he has also stated his retribution \"will be success\" [185] Trump is heavily running on immigration as a central campaign focus Trump's campaign has focused on dark and apocalyptic rhetoric about the state of the country and predicting doom if he does not win [186] [187] [188] [189] The Associated Press states that \"Trump's rallies take on the symbols, rhetoric and agenda of Christian nationalism.\" [190] During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has made numerous false and misleading statements [7] [8] [9] The large number of lies and false statements have been attributed to Trump's rhetorical style described as using the big lie and firehose of falsehood propaganda technique [191] [192] Trump has also made many personal attacks against Harris, [193] several of which are sexual in nature, [17] viewed as racist and misogynistic, [194] [195] [196] and considered a continued breaking of norms regarding political speech [17] Trump's harsher rhetoric against his political enemies has been described by historians, scholars, commentators and former generals as populist, authoritarian, fascist, [d] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in American history [14] [209] [16] Harris characterized Trump as a fascist during a live television appearance on October 23, [210] and Trump has called Harris a fascist during rallies throughout his 2024 campaign [206]\n\n\nAbortion\nAbortion access is a key topic during the campaign [211] [24] This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of the 2022 Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, leaving abortion law entirely to the states, including bans on abortion [212] The three justices appointed by former president Trump—Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch—all voted to overturn the federal right to an abortion in Dobbs [213] By April 2023, most Republican-controlled states had passed near-total bans on abortion, rendering it largely illegal throughout much of the southern United States According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 15 states that have de jure early-stage bans on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest [212]\n\n\nBorder security and immigration\nBorder security and immigration are among the top issues concerning potential voters in the election [230] [231] Polling has shown that most Americans want to reduce immigration [232] and that a substantial minority of white Republicans are concerned about white demographic decline [233] In 2023 and early 2024, a surge of migrants entering through the border with Mexico occurred [234] By June 2024, illegal crossings reached a three-year low following four consecutive monthly drops, which senior officials attributed to increased enforcement between the US and Mexico, the weather, and Biden's executive order increasing asylum restrictions [235]\n\n\nClimate change\nClimate change is expected to be an issue in the 2024 presidential election [26] [27] In 2023, the United States saw a record in crude oil production with over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day beating the 13 million barrels per day produced at the peak of Trump's presidency [271] America also dealt with supply shocks caused by the 2021–2024 global energy crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine [272]\n\n\nDemocracy\nPolling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the state of American democracy [285] [286] [287] Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with Christian nationalist autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election [288] According to an October 25 ABC/Ipsos poll, half of Americans see Trump as a fascist, described as \"a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.\" Meanwhile, only 22% saw Harris as a fascist by this definition [289] Some Republicans are concerned that Trump's former impeachment and four criminal indictments are attempts to influence the election and keep him from office [290] However, there is no evidence that Trump's criminal trials are \"election interference\" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party [85] [46] Trump has repeated false claims that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen from him [13]\n\n\nEconomic issues\nVoters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024 election [318] Following the COVID-19 pandemic, America went through a surge in inflation that raised prices on many goods, though the inflation rate had declined significantly during 2023 and 2024 [319] [320] [321] The New York Times reported that both candidates \"embraced a vision of a powerful federal government, using its muscle to intervene in markets in pursuit of a stronger and more prosperous economy.\" [322] The Wall Street Journal reported that economists found Trump's proposed policies created a greater risk of stoking inflation and generating higher budget deficits, relative to the Harris plan [323] Twenty-three Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter characterizing the Harris economic plan as \"vastly superior\" to the Trump plan [324]\n\n\nEducation\nTrump has pledged to terminate the Department of Education, [282] [361] [362] claiming it has been infiltrated by \"radical zealots and Marxists.\" [363] At the American Federation of Teachers national convention, Harris attacked recent efforts to ban books [364] She has also previously called for raising teacher's wages [365]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israel–Hamas war are expected issues in the election [366] Harris has signaled to generally follow Biden's foreign policy on NATO and Ukraine, supporting both in the aftermath of the Russian invasion [221] [367] A supporter of the two-state solution, [221] [368] Harris is seen as more sympathetic to Palestinians than Biden, who has described himself as a Zionist and has a long history with Israeli leaders [367] Regarding the Israel–Hamas war, analysts expect Harris to continue Biden's approach [369] Following Hamas's attack on Israel in 2023, Harris strongly supported Israel's offensive, [370] [369] stating that \"the threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel must be eliminated\" [221] However, she has since criticized Israel's approach and the Gaza humanitarian crisis [367] In March 2024, Harris opposed Israel's invasion of Rafah, [221] called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, [369] [221] and stated that the situation in Gaza is a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" [221] Harris has advocated for \"de-risking\" from Beijing, a policy that encourages reducing Western economic dependence on China [371] Harris is expected to continue deepening American alliances in Asia and the Pacific with the intention of curbing China's rising power both economically and militarily [372]\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas war views\nPolling has indicated that the majority of voters support a ceasefire and American mediation in the Israel-Hamas war [387] According to a YouGov poll in March 2024, 52% of Americans supported stopping weapons shipments to Israel, coming largely from Americans who voted for Biden in 2020 (62% support) and people who did not vote in 2020 (60%) Republicans opposed halting weapons shipments by 25 points [388] Republicans generally support arms to Israel, while Democrats are divided on the issue [389]\n\n\nHealthcare issues\nThe issue of healthcare, drug policy, and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to play a key role in the 2024 presidential election [397] [398]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn recent years, conservative politicians in state legislatures have introduced a growing number of bills that Democrats say restrict the rights of LGBT people, especially transgender people [404] [405]\n\n\nDemocratic Party\nOn April 25, 2023, President Biden officially announced his bid for re-election, confirming that Vice President Harris would remain his running mate [414] [415] Following this announcement, Republicans increased their focus on Harris, intensifying criticism against her [416] During late 2021, amid Biden's declining approval ratings, speculation arose regarding whether he would seek re-election [417] Public figures, including former Representatives Carolyn Maloney, Tim Ryan and Joe Cunningham, urged Biden not to run [418] [419] [420]\n\n\nDemocratic nominees\nTrump, the then-incumbent president, was defeated by Biden in the 2020 election and is not term-limited to run again in 2024, making

statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on November 15, 2022, and announced his candidacy in a speech at Mar-a-Lago the same day [450] [451] Trump was considered an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination [452] Trump had announced in March 2022 that his former vice president Mike Pence would not be his running mate [453] In civil proceedings, Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, defamation in 2024, and financial fraud in 2024, becoming the first former president to be convicted of a crime [18]\n\n\nRepublican

Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) [507] In May 2024, the Biden campaign proposed hosting two debates outside of the CPD timetable and refusing to participate in CPD-hosted debates Biden and Trump agreed to debates on CNN on June 27 and ABC News on September 10 [508] The Harris camp suggested that another debate could be held in October after the September 10 debate with Trump [509]\nOn

2019, Climate change was a major issue in the campaign In March 2021, Conservative leader O'Toole announced a carbon pricing plan to replace the current Liberal carbon tax, despite previous Conservative opposition to any form of a carbon tax [104] There was thus a broad consensus among all represented parties for policies to mitigate climate change, although they differed in the emissions targets, the level of the carbon tax, and the transition path to a clean economy Only the People's Party opposed all climate change policies and vowed to withdraw from the Paris climate accord [105]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a major campaign issue The Liberal party sought to defend its pandemic response, while trying to tie Erin O'Toole to Alberta Premier Jason Kenney O'Toole always sidestepped questions about his previous support for Kenney's pandemic response by saying he would work with any premier to face the pandemic regardless of their political stripes [106] During the campaign, Alberta was experiencing its worst wave of the pandemic in terms of hospitalisations [107]\n\n\nGun control\nIn September 2021, O'Toole changed his position on gun control Reverting from his initial promise of repealing Prime Minister Trudeau's May 2020 ban on assault weapons, he changed his stance on the issue, promising that he would not repeal the ban [112] Political commentators and analysts described O'Toole's leadership as shifting the Conservative Party to the political centre [113]\n\n\nImplosion of the Green Party\nThe Green Party of Canada experienced a period of infighting beginning in June 2021, when Jenica Atwin, one of its three MPs, crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party over a dispute regarding the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis [114] Although there were calls for the party leader Annamie Paul to resign, she stayed on as leader through the federal election She spent the majority of the election campaigning in her chosen riding of Toronto Centre, but failed to win the seat [115]\n\n\nRise of the People's Party\nThe campaign was also marked by a rise in support for the People's Party of Canada Before the election, Mainstreet Research gave the party more than 8 per cent of the vote, [116] and Abacus Data noted particularly high scores among Canadians under the age of 60 [117] Justin Trudeau and Yves-François Blanchet indirectly accused the Conservatives for the rise of the PPC, with Trudeau notably criticizing Erin O'Toole for not requiring his party's candidates to be vaccinated [118]\n\n\nCampaign slogans\nThe

recommended a permanent and publicly funded commission be tasked with organizing two debates for every federal election  It also called for the commission, not the government, to set the criteria for

in a riding where the margin of victory is less than 0.1 per cent (one one-thousandth) of the votes cast In cases where there is a larger but still narrow margin of victory, an elector can request a judicial recount While no validated results triggered an automatic recount in this election, judicial recounts were requested in four ridings: Brome—Missisquoi, Davenport, Châteauguay—Lacolle and Trois-Rivières Only Châteauguay—Lacolle saw its initial result overturned: the recount had Liberal incumbent MP Brenda Shanahan proclaimed the ultimate winner over Bloc candidate Patrick O'Hara, by a margin of only 12 votes [153] It was the first time validated results were reversed by a judicial recount since the 2008 election [154] Recounts in Brome—Missiquoi and Davenport began on October 12; however, in both ridings the early count appeared to confirm the initial validated results, leading both challengers to concede defeat and the recount to be terminated [155] [156]\n\n\nSpecial ballots

divided than ever, and 52 per cent feel that Canada's democratic system is broken [166]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nSeveral factors were quickly identified as having had a significant influence on the results Some political scientists and commentators debated whether the PPC's better performance, compared to the 2019 federal election, contributed to the Conservatives under Erin O'Toole losing to the Liberals Mainstreet Research CEO Quito Maggi and University of Toronto political science professor Nelson Wiseman posited that the PPC may have cost the Conservatives at least ten ridings [167] [168] [169] The votes obtained by PPC candidates were larger than the margin of victory in 21 ridings, where the Conservative candidate was in second place (12 in Ontario, five in BC, two in Alberta, one in Quebec and one in Newfoundland) Of those seats, 14 went to the Liberals, six to the NDP, and one to the Bloc; however, it has been described as not a simple generalization, as a significant amount of PPC support arose from non-Conservative voters [170]\n\n\nCalls for electoral reform\nCommentators at The Conversation noted that for a second election in a row the Liberals won the greatest number of seats but lost the popular vote to the Conservatives under the first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system [181] During the campaign, Trudeau said he remains open to getting rid of Canada's FPTP if re-elected, provided there is consensus on the issue; he also expressed his preference for ranked voting over proportional representation Trudeau had promised during the 2015 campaign that the 2015 federal election would be the last federal election to use FPTP [182] [181]\n\n\nCandidates elected\nForty-nine MPs were elected for the first time, and two more (Randy Boissonnault and John Aldag) returned after having been defeated in 2019 The number of female MPs—103, up from 100 in 2019—is a record high for the House, and 22 of the first-time MPs are women [183]\n\n\nChinese government interference\nA year following the election, Conservative Party politicians including former leader Erin O'Toole blamed Chinese government interference as a factor behind the loss for the party In a 2022 interview on the UnCommons podcast with Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, O'Toole opined that media outfits linked to the Chinese Communist Party could have cost the Conservatives up to \"eight or nine seats.\" [189]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2021 Canadian federal election**\n\nThe 2021 Canadian federal election was held on September 20, 2021, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada. The election was called by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on August 15, 2021, and was the 44th federal election in Canadian history.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2019 Canadian federal election resulted in the Liberals, led by incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, losing both their parliamentary majority and the popular vote but nevertheless winning the most seats and remaining in office as a minority government. The Conservatives, who had gained seats and won the popular vote, continued as the Official Opposition. The Bloc Québécois regained official party status and became the third party, replacing the New Democrats in that role, with the latter party losing seats but maintaining official party status as the fourth party. Although the Greens increased their seats in the House of Commons, they ultimately failed to achieve the required number of MPs (twelve) for official party status. No other party won any seats.\n\n**Political parties and standings**\n\nThe table below lists parties represented and seats held in the House of Commons after the 2019 federal election, at dissolution, and after the 2021 federal election. An expected by-election in Haldimand—Norfolk to fill the vacant seat was rendered moot by the commencement of the general election.\n\n| Party | 2019 | Dissolution | 2021 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liberal | 157 | 155 | 160 |\n| Conservative | 121 | 119 | 119 |\n| Bloc Québécois | 32 | 32 | 32 |\n| New Democratic | 24 | 24 | 25 |\n| Green | 3 | 3 | 3 |\n| People's | 0 | 0 | 2 |\n| Other | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n**Incumbents not running for re-election**\n\nBelow are the 31 MPs who chose not to run in the 2021 federal election.\n\n1.

all parties for evaluating the financial impact of any of their proposals, but does not release details until the requesting party has done so as well [129] After the election, the PBO revealed that 130 requests had been received from all parties, of which only 72 were made public [130] [131] It did release a report outlining various baselines that were used in its costing exercises [132]\n\n\nLeaders' debates\nIn June 2020, the Leaders' Debates Commission released its report reviewing the 2019 election debates and making recommendations for future debates [134] [135] The report recommended a permanent and publicly funded commission be tasked with organizing two debates for every federal election  It also called for the commission, not the government, to set the criteria for participation in future election debates [134] [135]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nThe Liberals maintained their status as largest party in the House of Commons The results were very close to those of the 2019

largest party in the House of Commons The results were very close to those of the 2019 federal election [5]\n\n\nResults by province\nIn a federal election, a judicial recount is automatically ordered in a riding where the margin of victory is less than 0.1 per cent (one one-thousandth) of the votes cast In cases where there is a larger but still narrow margin of victory, an elector can request a judicial recount While no validated results triggered an automatic recount in this election, judicial recounts were requested in four ridings: Brome—Missisquoi, Davenport, Châteauguay—Lacolle and Trois-Rivières Only Châteauguay—Lacolle saw its initial result overturned: the recount had Liberal incumbent MP Brenda Shanahan proclaimed the ultimate winner over Bloc candidate Patrick O'Hara, by a margin of only 12 votes [153] It was the first time validated results were reversed by a judicial recount since the 2008 election [154] Recounts in Brome—Missiquoi and Davenport began on October 12; however, in both ridings the early count appeared to confirm the initial validated results, leading both challengers to concede defeat and the recount to be terminated [155] [156]\n\n\nSpecial ballots

followed by (I).\n\n\nMaps\nThe remarkable similarity of the results and those of the 2019 federal election may have reinforced voters' sentiments that the early election was unnecessary, and its meagre results have left their mark on the electorate A survey by Maru Public Opinion revealed that 77 per cent of respondents believe that Canada is more divided than ever, and 52 per cent feel that Canada's democratic system is broken [166]\n\n\nAnalysis and aftermath\nThe remarkable similarity of the results and those of the 2019 federal election may have reinforced voters' sentiments that the early election was unnecessary, and its meagre results have left their mark on the electorate A survey by Maru Public Opinion revealed that 77 per cent of respondents believe that Canada is more divided than ever, and 52 per cent feel that Canada's democratic system is broken [166]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nSeveral factors were quickly identified as having had a significant influence on the results Some political scientists and commentators debated whether the PPC's better performance, compared to the 2019 federal election, contributed to the Conservatives under Erin O'Toole losing to the Liberals Mainstreet Research CEO Quito Maggi and University of Toronto political science professor Nelson Wiseman posited that the PPC may have cost the Conservatives at least ten ridings [167] [168] [169] The votes obtained by PPC candidates were larger than the margin of victory in 21 ridings, where the Conservative candidate was in second place (12 in Ontario, five in BC, two in Alberta, one in Quebec and one in Newfoundland) Of those seats, 14 went to the Liberals, six to the NDP, and one to the Bloc; however, it has been described as not a simple generalization, as a significant amount of PPC support arose from non-Conservative voters [170]\n\n\nCalls for electoral reform\nCommentators at The Conversation noted that for a second election in a row the Liberals won the greatest number of seats but lost the popular vote to the Conservatives under the first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system [181] During the campaign, Trudeau said he remains open to getting rid of Canada's FPTP if re-elected, provided there is consensus on the issue; he also expressed his preference for ranked voting over proportional representation Trudeau had promised during the 2015 campaign that the 2015 federal election would be the last federal election to use FPTP [182] [181]\n\n\nCandidates elected\nForty-nine MPs were elected for the first time, and two more (Randy Boissonnault and John Aldag) returned after having been defeated in 2019 The number of female MPs—103, up from 100 in 2019—is a record high for the House, and 22 of the first-time MPs are women [183]\n\n\nChinese government interference\nA year following the election, Conservative Party politicians including former leader Erin O'Toole blamed Chinese government interference as a factor behind the loss for the party In a 2022 interview on the UnCommons podcast with Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, O'Toole opined that media outfits linked to the Chinese Communist Party could have cost the Conservatives up to \"eight or nine seats.\" [189]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

his arrest, he entered a drug treatment center [35] To satisfy conditions of his probation, Kennedy worked as a volunteer for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and was required to attend regular drug rehabilitation sessions [38] Kennedy asserted that this ended his 14 years of heroin use, which he said had begun when he was 15 [34] His probation ended a year early [38]\n\n\nRiverkeeper\nIn 1984, Kennedy began volunteering at The Hudson River Fisherman's Association, renamed Riverkeeper in 1986 after a patrol boat it had built with settlement money from legal victories preceding Kennedy's arrival [39] [40] After he was admitted to the New York bar in 1985, Riverkeeper hired him as senior attorney [38] [39] [41] Kennedy litigated and supervised environmental enforcement lawsuits on the east coast estuaries on behalf of Hudson Riverkeeper and the Long Island Soundkeeper, [42] where he was also a board member Long Island Soundkeeper sued several municipalities and cities along the Connecticut and New York coastlines [43] On the Hudson, Kennedy sued municipalities and industries, including General Electric, to stop discharging pollution and clean up legacy contamination [44] His work at Riverkeeper set long-term environmental legal standards [44]\n\n\nPace Environmental Litigation Clinic\nIn 1987, Kennedy founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University School of Law, where for three decades he was the clinic's supervising attorney and co-director and Clinical Professor of Law [53] Kennedy obtained a

supervision of Kennedy and his co-director, Professor Karl Coplan The clinic's full-time clients are Riverkeeper and Long Island Soundkeeper [54]\n\n\nWaterkeeper Alliance\nIn June 1999, as Riverkeeper's success on the Hudson began inspiring the creation of Waterkeepers across North America, Kennedy and a few dozen Riverkeepers gathered in Southampton, Long Island, to found the Waterkeeper Alliance, which is now the umbrella group for the 344 licensed Waterkeeper programs [64] in 44 countries [65] As president, Kennedy oversaw its legal, membership, policy and fundraising programs The Alliance is dedicated to promoting \"swimmable, fishable, drinkable waterways, worldwide\" [66]\n\n\nNew York City Watershed Agreement\nBeginning in 1991, Kennedy represented environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers in a series of lawsuits against New York City and upstate watershed polluters Kennedy authored a series of articles and reports [76] [77] [78] [79] alleging that New York State was abdicating its responsibility to protect the water repository and supply In 1996, he helped orchestrate the $1.2 billion New York City Watershed Agreement, which New York magazine recognized in its cover story, \"The Kennedy Who Matters\" [80] This agreement, which Kennedy negotiated on behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable development [81]\n\n\nKennedy & Madonna LLP\nIn 2000, Kennedy and the environmental lawyer Kevin Madonna founded the environmental law firm Kennedy & Madonna, LLP, to represent private plaintiffs against polluters [82] The firm litigates environmental contamination cases on behalf of individuals, non-profit organizations, school districts, public water suppliers, Indian tribes, municipalities and states In 2001, Kennedy & Madonna organized a team of prestigious plaintiff law firms to challenge pollution from industrial pork and poultry production [83] In 2004, the firm was part of a legal team that secured a $70 million settlement for property owners in Pensacola, Florida whose properties were contaminated by chemicals from an adjacent Superfund site [84]\n\n\nMorgan & Morgan\nIn 2016, Kennedy became counsel to the Morgan & Morgan law firm [90] The partnership arose from the two firms' successful collaboration on the case against SoCalGas Company following the Aliso Canyon gas leak in California [91] In 2017, Kennedy and his partners sued Monsanto in federal court in San Francisco, on behalf of plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases that, the plaintiffs allege, were a result of exposure to Monsanto's glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup Kennedy and his team also filed a class action lawsuit against Monsanto for failing to warn consumers about the dangers allegedly posed by exposure to Roundup [92]\n\n\nOther ventures\nIn 1999, Kennedy, Chris Bartle and John Hoving created a bottled water company, Keeper Springs, which donated all of its profits to Waterkeeper Alliance [94]\n\n\nMinority and poor communities\nIn his first case as an environmental attorney, Kennedy represented the NAACP in a lawsuit against a proposal to build a garbage transfer station in a minority neighborhood in Ossining, New York [106]\n\n\nInternational and indigenous rights\nStarting in 1985, Kennedy helped develop the Natural Resources Defense Council's international program for environmental, energy, and human rights, traveling to Canada and Latin America to assist indigenous tribes in protecting their homelands and opposing large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas [108]\n\n\nMilitary and Vieques\nKennedy has been a critic of environmental damage by the U.S military [122] [123]\n\n\nHydroelectricity\nIn 1991, Kennedy helped lead a campaign to block Hydro-Québec from building the James Bay Hydro-project, a massive dam project in northern Quebec [129]\n\n\nCape Wind\nIn 2005, Kennedy clashed with national environmental groups over his opposition to the Cape Wind Project, a proposed offshore wind farm in Cape Cod, Massachusetts (in Nantucket Sound) Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the project was a costly boondoggle This position angered some environmentalists, and brought Kennedy criticism by commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and John Stossel, the latter of whom called him a hypocrite [137] [better source needed] Kennedy argued in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, \"Vermont wants to take its nuclear plant off line and replace it with clean, green power from Hydro-Québec—power available to Massachusetts utilities—at a cost of six cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) Cape Wind electricity, by a conservative estimate and based on figures they filed with the state, comes in at 25 cents per kwh.\" [138]\n\n\nPolitical views\nKennedy's political rhetoric often uses conspiracy theories [139] [140] [141]\n\n\nEconomic inequality\nKennedy has argued that poor communities shoulder a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution [142] Speaking at the 2016 South by Southwest environment conference, he said, \"Polluters always choose the soft target of poverty\", noting that Chicago's South Side has the highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in America, [143] and added that 80% of \"uncontrolled toxic waste dumps\" are in black neighborhoods, with the largest site in the U.S in Emelle, Alabama, which is 90% black [144]\n\n\nForeign affairs and military intervention\nKennedy is critical of the United States' alliances with dictatorships like Saudi Arabia He criticized the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war, calling it a \"genocide against the Iranian-backed Houthi tribe.\" [148] Kennedy is a supporter of Israel In December 2023, he had a heated exchange with Breaking Points host Krystal Ball, in what Rabbi Shmuley Boteach called \"the single greatest defense of Israel on videos since the start of the\" 2023 Israel–Hamas war [149]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nIn 2023, Kennedy said he was \"arguably the leading environmentalist in the country\" [163] He promotes populist and anti-establishment environmental policies, claiming that \"Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum and the billionaire boys' club in Davos\" have hijacked the climate crisis [145] In a 2015 interview, Kennedy said of politicians skeptical of global warming that he \"wished there were a law you could punish them under\" [164] [165] He has said that environmentalists' priority should be to tackle the \"carbon industry\" He has called the current society and economy unsustainable and based on a \"longtime deadly addiction to coal and oil\" and contended that the economic system rewards pollution In 2020, Kennedy said: \"Right now, we have a market that is governed by rules that were written by the carbon incumbents to reward the dirtiest, filthiest, most poisonous, most toxic, most war-mongering fields from hell, rather than the cheap, clean, green, wholesome and patriotic fields from heaven.\" [166] [167] [168]\n\n\nQuestioning the validity of elections\nKennedy has been critical of the integrity of the voting process In June 2006, he published an article in Rolling Stone purporting to show that GOP operatives stole the 2004 presidential election for President George W Bush [198] Most Democrats and Republicans regarded it as a conspiracy theory The journalist Farhad Manjoo countered Kennedy's conclusions, writing: \"If you do read Kennedy's article, be prepared to machete your way through numerous errors of interpretation and his deliberate omission of key bits of data.\" [199]\n\n\nPolitical endorsements\nKennedy was on his uncle Ted Kennedy's 1970 and 1976 Massachusetts senatorial campaigns, and was on the national staff and a state coordinator for Ted's 1980 presidential campaign [citation needed]\n\n\nPolitical aspirations\nKennedy considered running for political office in 2000, when New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan did not seek reelection to the U.S Senate seat formerly held by Kennedy's father [207]\n\n\nCandidacy aspirations\nKennedy considered running for political office in 2000, when New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan did not seek reelection to the U.S Senate seat formerly held by Kennedy's father [207]\n\n\n2000s consideration for top environmental jobs\nAs a \"well-respected climate lawyer\" in the 2000s, [205] Kennedy was \"often linked to top environmental jobs in Democratic administrations\", including in the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential elections [210] He was considered as a potential White House Council on Environmental Quality chair for Al Gore in 2000 and considered for the role of EPA administrator under John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008 [210]\n\n\n2024 presidential campaign\n\nIn a speech in New Hampshire on March 3, 2023, Kennedy said he was considering a run for president in 2024: \"I am thinking about it I've passed the biggest hurdle, which is that my wife has greenlighted it.\" [211]\n\nAnti-vaccine advocacy and conspiracy theories on public health\nKennedy is a prominent voice in the anti-vaccine movement, spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda [11] [3] [235] [2] [236] The infectious disease specialist Michael Osterholm has said that Kennedy's \"anti-vaccine disinformation\" is effective \"because it's portrayed to the public with graphs and figures and what appears to be scientific data He has perfected the art of illusion of fact.\" Osterholm added: \"this is about people's lives And the consequences of promoting this kind of disinformation, as credible as it may seem, is simply dangerous.\" [236]\n\n\nOverview\nKennedy is a prominent voice in the anti-vaccine movement, spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda [11] [3] [235] [2] [236] The infectious disease specialist Michael Osterholm has said that Kennedy's \"anti-vaccine disinformation\" is effective \"because it's portrayed to the public with graphs and figures and what appears to be scientific data He has perfected the art of illusion of fact.\" Osterholm added: \"this is about people's lives And the consequences of promoting this kind of disinformation, as credible as it may seem, is simply dangerous.\" [236]\n\n\nVaccines and autism claims\nKennedy chairs the Children's Health Defense (formerly known as the World Mercury Project), an anti-vaccine advocacy group he joined in 2015 [3] [2] In its early years, the group focused on mercury in industry and medicine, especially the ethylmercury used in thimerosal in vaccines [241] [242] The group alleges that exposure to certain chemicals and radiation has caused a wide range of conditions in many American children, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases Children's Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against vaccines, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, and wireless communication, among other things The group has been identified as one of two major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in late 2018 and early 2019 [3] [243] [244] Members of his family have criticized Kennedy and his organization, saying he spreads \"dangerous misinformation\" and that his work has \"heartbreaking\" consequences [245]\n\n\nWritings and speeches promoting anti-vaccine theories\nIn June 2005, Kennedy wrote an article, \"Deadly Immunity\", that appeared in both Rolling Stone and Salon.com and alleged a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism [263] The article contained factual errors, leading Salon to issue five corrections [264] [265] Joan Walsh, Salon.com's editor-in-chief at the time and the sole Salon editor of the piece, said she had mistakenly relied on Rolling Stone's fact-checking, a process she later learned was \"less than arduous\" As soon as the piece was up, she said, \"we were besieged by scientists and advocates showing how Kennedy had misunderstood, incorrectly cited, and perhaps even falsified data... It was the worst mistake of my career I probably should have been fired.\" [266]\n\n\nMeeting with Donald Trump\nOn January 10, 2017, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump met to discuss a position in the Trump administration Kennedy said afterward that he had accepted an offer from Trump to chair the Vaccine Safety Task Force, but a spokeswoman for Trump's transition said that no final decision had been made [276] In an August 2017 interview with STAT News reporter Helen Branswell, Kennedy said that he had been meeting with federal public health regulators at the White House's request to discuss defects in vaccine safety science [277]\n\n\nControversy with Robert De Niro\nOn February 15, 2017, Kennedy and the actor Robert De Niro gave a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in which they said the press were working for the vaccination industry and did not allow debates on vaccination science They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or other citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines Craig Foster, a psychology professor who studies pseudoscience, deemed the challenge \"not science\", calling it a \"carefully constructed 'contest' that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see\" Foster added, \"Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful.\" [278]\n\n\nSamoa measles outbreak\nOn June 4, 2019, during a visit to Samoa coinciding with its 57th annual independence celebration, Kennedy appeared in an Instagram photo with Australian-Samoan anti-vaccine activist Taylor Winterstein Kennedy's charity and Winterstein have both perpetuated the allegation that the MMR vaccine played a role in the 2018 deaths of two Samoan infants, despite the subsequent revelation that the infants had mistakenly received a muscle relaxant along with the vaccine Kennedy has drawn criticism for fueling vaccine hesitancy amid a social climate that gave rise to the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak, which killed over 70 people, and the 2019 Tonga measles outbreak [279] [280] [281]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy promoted multiple conspiracy theories related to COVID, including false claims that Anthony Fauci and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation were trying to profit off a vaccine, [282] [283] [284] and suggesting that Bill Gates would cut off access to money of people who do not get vaccinated, allowing them to starve [285] In August 2020, Kennedy appeared in an hour-long interview with Alec Baldwin on Instagram and touted a number of incorrect and misleading claims about vaccines and public health measures related to the pandemic Public health officials and scientists criticized Baldwin for letting Kennedy's claims go unchallenged [286]\n\n\nMedical racism conspiracy theory\nKennedy targets Black Americans with anti-vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories, linking vaccination with instances of medical racism such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study [307] [235] Echoing others in the anti-vaccination movement, Children's Health Defense claimed that the U.S government seeks to harm ethnic minorities by prioritizing them for COVID vaccines In March 2021, Children's Health Defense released an anti-vaccine propaganda video, \"Medical Racism: The New Apartheid\", that promotes COVID-19 conspiracy theories and claims that COVID-19 vaccination efforts are medical experiments on Black people Kennedy appears in the video, inviting viewers to disregard information dispensed by health authorities and doctors Brandi Collin-Dexter, a Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said, \"the notorious figures and false narratives in the documentary were recognizable\" and \"the film's incompatible narratives sought to take advantage of the pain felt by Black communities.\" [235] [308] [309] At the urging of disinformation experts, the film was removed from Facebook, but Kennedy was permitted to keep his account [310]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS denialism\nIn his book The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the War on Democracy and Public Health, Kennedy writes that he takes \"no position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS\", [292]: 347  but spends over 100 pages quoting HIV denialists such as Peter Duesberg who question the isolation of HIV and the etiology of AIDS [311] Kennedy refers to the \"orthodoxy that HIV alone causes AIDS\" [292]: 348  and the \"theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS\", [292]: 351  and repeats the false HIV/AIDS denialist claim that no one has isolated the HIV particle and \"No one has been able to point to a study that demonstrates their hypothesis using accepted scientific proofs\".: 348  He also repeats the false claim that the early AIDS drug AZT is \"absolutely fatal\" [292]: 332  due to its \"horrendous toxicity\" [292]: 298  Molecular biologist Dan Wilson points out that Kennedy falsely claims that Luc Montagnier, the discoverer of HIV, was a \"convert\" to Duesberg's fringe hypothesis Wilson concludes that Kennedy is a \"full blown\" HIV/AIDS denialist [311] [292] Epidemiologist Tara C Smith suggests that Kennedy's book \"even flirts with outright germ theory denial\", quoting from a portion in which Kennedy contrasts the germ theory of disease with terrain theory [312] and another in which he writes that Louis Pasteur \"is said to have recanted\" germ theory on his deathbed in favor of Antoine Béchamp's terrain theory, [312]: Table 1  an unproven claim that circulates among germ theory denialists [313]\n\n\nPushback from the Kennedy family\nSeveral members of Kennedy's close family have distanced themselves from his anti-vaccination activities and conspiracy theories on public health, and condemned his comments equating public health measures with Nazi war crimes [314] On May 8, 2019, his niece Maeve Kennedy McKean and elder siblings Kathleen and Joseph wrote an open letter saying that while Kennedy has championed many admirable causes, he \"has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines\" [315] On December 30, 2020, another niece, Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, a physician, wrote a similar open letter, saying that her uncle published misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines' side effects [316]\n\n\nOther opinions\nKennedy was a founding board member of the Food Allergy Initiative His son has anaphylactic peanut allergies Kennedy wrote the foreword to The Peanut Allergy Epidemic, in which he and the authors falsely link increasing food allergies in children to certain vaccines that were approved beginning in 1989 [317] [3]\n\n\nFood allergies\nKennedy was a founding board member of the Food Allergy Initiative His son has anaphylactic peanut allergies Kennedy wrote the foreword to The Peanut Allergy Epidemic, in which he and the authors falsely link increasing food allergies in children to certain vaccines that were approved beginning in 1989 [317] [3]\n\n\nMurder of Martha Moxley\nIn 2003, Kennedy published an article in The Atlantic Monthly about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, in which he insists that his cousin Michael Skakel's indictment \"was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison\" Kennedy argues that evidence suggests that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family's live-in tutor, killed Moxley, and calls investigative journalist Dominick Dunne the \"driving force\" behind Skakel's prosecution [318] In 2016, Kennedy released the book Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit [319] In 2017, the rights to the book were optioned by FX

Cod, Massachusetts (in Nantucket Sound) Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the project was a costly boondoggle This position angered some environmentalists, and brought Kennedy criticism by commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and John Stossel, the latter of whom called him a hypocrite [137] [better source needed] Kennedy argued in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, \"Vermont wants to take its nuclear plant off line and replace it with clean, green power from Hydro-Québec—power available to Massachusetts utilities—at a cost of six cents per

them under\" [164] [165] He has said that environmentalists' priority should be to tackle the \"carbon industry\" He has called the current society and economy unsustainable and based on a \"longtime deadly addiction to coal and oil\" and contended that the economic system rewards pollution In 2020, Kennedy said: \"Right now, we have a market that is governed by rules that were written by the carbon incumbents to reward the dirtiest, filthiest, most poisonous, most toxic, most war-mongering fields from hell, rather than the cheap, clean, green, wholesome and patriotic fields from heaven.\" [166] [167] [168]\n\n\nQuestioning the validity of elections\nKennedy has been critical of the integrity of the voting process In June 2006, he published an article in Rolling Stone purporting to show

propaganda [11] [3] [235] [2] [236] The infectious disease specialist Michael Osterholm has said that Kennedy's \"anti-vaccine disinformation\" is effective \"because it's portrayed to the public with graphs and figures and what appears to be scientific data He has perfected the art of illusion of fact.\" Osterholm added: \"this is about people's lives And the consequences of promoting this kind of disinformation, as credible as it may seem, is simply dangerous.\" [236]\n\n\nOverview\nKennedy is a prominent voice in the anti-vaccine movement, spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda [11] [3] [235] [2] [236] The infectious disease specialist Michael Osterholm has said that Kennedy's \"anti-vaccine disinformation\" is effective \"because it's portrayed to the public with graphs and figures and what appears to be scientific data He has perfected the art of illusion of fact.\" Osterholm added: \"this is about people's lives And the

known as the World Mercury Project), an anti-vaccine advocacy group he joined in 2015 [3] [2] In its early years, the group focused on mercury in industry and medicine, especially the ethylmercury used in thimerosal in vaccines [241] [242] The group alleges that exposure to certain chemicals and radiation has caused a wide range of conditions in many American children, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases Children's Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against vaccines, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, and wireless communication, among other things The group has been identified as one of two major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in late 2018 and early 2019 [3] [243] [244] Members of his family have criticized Kennedy and his organization, saying he spreads \"dangerous misinformation\" and that his work has \"heartbreaking\" consequences [245]\n\n\nWritings and speeches promoting anti-vaccine theories\nIn June 2005, Kennedy wrote an article, \"Deadly Immunity\", that appeared in both Rolling Stone and Salon.com and alleged a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism [263] The article contained factual errors, leading Salon to issue five corrections [264] [265] Joan Walsh, Salon.com's editor-in-chief at the time and the sole Salon editor of the piece, said she had mistakenly relied on Rolling Stone's fact-checking, a process she later learned was \"less than arduous\" As soon as the piece was up, she said, \"we were besieged by scientists and advocates showing how Kennedy had misunderstood, incorrectly cited, and perhaps even falsified data... It was the worst mistake of my career I probably should have been fired.\" [266]\n\n\nMeeting with Donald Trump\nOn January 10, 2017, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump met to discuss a position in the Trump administration Kennedy said afterward that he had accepted an offer from Trump to chair the Vaccine Safety Task Force, but a spokeswoman for Trump's transition said that no final decision had been made [276] In an August 2017 interview with STAT News reporter Helen Branswell, Kennedy said that he had been meeting with federal public health regulators at the White House's request to discuss defects in vaccine safety science [277]\n\n\nControversy with Robert De Niro\nOn February 15, 2017, Kennedy and the actor Robert De Niro gave a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in which they said the press were working for the vaccination industry and did not allow debates on vaccination science They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or other citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines Craig Foster, a psychology professor who studies pseudoscience, deemed the challenge \"not science\", calling it a \"carefully constructed 'contest' that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see\" Foster added, \"Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful.\" [278]\n\n\nSamoa measles outbreak\nOn June 4, 2019, during a visit to Samoa coinciding with its 57th annual independence celebration, Kennedy appeared in an Instagram photo with Australian-Samoan anti-vaccine activist Taylor Winterstein Kennedy's charity and Winterstein have both perpetuated the allegation that the MMR vaccine played a role in the 2018 deaths of two Samoan infants, despite the subsequent revelation that the infants had mistakenly received a muscle relaxant along with the vaccine Kennedy has drawn criticism for fueling vaccine hesitancy amid a social climate that gave rise to the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak, which killed over 70 people, and the 2019 Tonga measles outbreak [279] [280] [281]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy promoted multiple conspiracy theories related to COVID, including false claims that Anthony Fauci and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation were trying to profit off a vaccine, [282] [283] [284] and suggesting that Bill Gates would cut off access to money of people who do not get vaccinated, allowing them to starve [285] In August 2020, Kennedy appeared in an hour-long interview with Alec Baldwin on Instagram and touted a number of incorrect and misleading claims about vaccines and public health measures related to the pandemic Public health officials and scientists criticized Baldwin for letting Kennedy's claims go unchallenged [286]\n\n\nMedical racism conspiracy theory\nKennedy targets Black Americans with anti-vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories, linking vaccination with instances of medical racism such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study [307] [235] Echoing others in the anti-vaccination movement, Children's Health Defense claimed that the U.S government seeks to harm ethnic minorities by prioritizing them for COVID vaccines In March 2021, Children's Health Defense released an anti-vaccine propaganda video, \"Medical Racism: The New Apartheid\", that promotes COVID-19 conspiracy theories and claims that COVID-19 vaccination efforts are medical experiments on Black people Kennedy appears in the video, inviting viewers to disregard information dispensed by health authorities and doctors Brandi Collin-Dexter, a Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said, \"the notorious figures and false narratives in the documentary were recognizable\" and \"the film's incompatible narratives sought to take advantage of the pain felt by Black communities.\" [235] [308] [309] At the urging of disinformation experts, the film was removed from Facebook, but Kennedy was permitted to keep his account [310]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS denialism\nIn his book The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the War on Democracy and Public Health, Kennedy writes that he takes \"no position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS\", [292]: 347  but spends over 100 pages quoting HIV denialists such as Peter Duesberg who question the isolation of HIV and the etiology of AIDS [311] Kennedy refers to the \"orthodoxy that HIV alone causes AIDS\" [292]: 348  and the \"theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS\", [292]: 351  and repeats the false HIV/AIDS denialist claim that no one has isolated the HIV particle and \"No one has been able to point to a study that demonstrates their hypothesis using accepted scientific proofs\".: 348  He also repeats the false claim that the early AIDS drug AZT is \"absolutely fatal\" [292]: 332  due to its \"horrendous toxicity\" [292]: 298  Molecular biologist Dan Wilson points out that Kennedy falsely claims that Luc Montagnier, the discoverer of HIV, was a \"convert\" to Duesberg's fringe hypothesis Wilson concludes that Kennedy is a \"full blown\" HIV/AIDS denialist [311] [292] Epidemiologist Tara C Smith suggests that Kennedy's book \"even flirts with outright germ theory denial\", quoting from a portion in which Kennedy contrasts the germ theory of disease with terrain theory [312] and another in which he writes that Louis Pasteur \"is said to have recanted\" germ theory on his deathbed in favor of Antoine Béchamp's terrain theory, [312]: Table 1  an unproven claim that circulates among germ theory denialists [313]\n\n\nPushback from the Kennedy family\nSeveral members of Kennedy's close family have distanced themselves from his anti-vaccination activities and conspiracy theories on public health, and condemned his comments equating public health measures with Nazi war crimes [314] On May 8, 2019, his niece Maeve Kennedy McKean and elder siblings Kathleen and Joseph wrote an open letter saying that while Kennedy has championed many admirable causes, he \"has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind

It is the first Indian aircraft carrier to be designed and built indigenously, and it represents a significant milestone in the country's naval history. The ship was commissioned on 2 September 2022, and it is currently undergoing flight trials and operational testing.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe development of INS Vikrant began in 1999, when the Indian Defence Minister, George Fernandes, authorized the construction of an aircraft carrier under the Project 71 Air Defence Ship (ADS). The project aimed to build a carrier that would carry modern jet fighters, replacing the aging Sea Harrier fleet. In 2001, Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) released a graphic illustration of a 32,000-tonne STOBAR (Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) design with a pronounced ski jump.\n\n**Repeat Order**\n\nFollowing the formal commissioning of Vikrant, a proposal was made to build another IAC class carrier before INS Vishal. In November 2023, a proposal worth ₹400 billion for a new carrier was on track to be approved by the Defense Acquisition Council, the country's top defense decision-making body headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\n**Design**\n\nINS Vikrant is 262 metres long and 62 metres wide, and it displaces about 45,000 tonnes. It features a STOBAR configuration, with a pronounced ski jump at the bow. The ship can carry an air group of up to thirty-six aircraft, including 26 fixed-wing combat aircraft, and a mix of Dhruv MK-III, Sikorsky MH-60R, and Kamov Ka-31 helicopters. The Ka-31 will fulfill the airborne early warning (AEW) role, MH-60R will provide anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities, and Dhruv will be used mainly for search and rescue operations.\n\n**Carrier Air Group**\n\nEarlier, the Indian Navy considered fielding MiG-29K and LCA Navy on Vikrant. In 2009, the then navy Chief Admiral Nirmal Kumar Verma hinted that the Navy was carrying out a concept study for a more capable naval fighter, which turned out to be the HAL TEDBF, unveiled at 2021 Aero India airshow. In June 2012, Flight Global reported that the Indian Navy was considering the purchase of Dassault Rafale M (Naval variant) for Vikrant. The Rafale was by then declared the winner of IAF's MMRCA competition.\n\n**Construction**\n\nVikrant is the first aircraft carrier to be designed by the Warship Design Bureau (formerly Directorate of Naval Design) of the Indian Navy and the first warship to be built by Cochin Shipyard. Its construction involved participation of a large number of private and public firms.\n\n**Launch**\n\nIn July 2013, Defence Minister Antony announced that Vikrant would be launched on 12 August at the Cochin Shipyard. The ship was launched by his wife, Elizabeth Antony, on 12 August 2013.\n\n**Undocking and Fitting-out**\n\nVikrant was undocked on 10 June 2015 after the completion of structural work. Cabling, piping, heat and ventilation works were scheduled to be completed by 2017, with sea trials to begin thereafter. By October 2015, the construction of the hull was close to 98 percent complete, with flight deck construction underway. The installation of machinery, piping, and the propeller shafts was in progress by January 2016; however, there were delays in the delivery of equipment from Russia for the carrier's aviation complex. By May 2017, the carrier's fitting-out was 62% complete, with trials of the auxiliary systems scheduled by late 2017.\n\n**Harbour and Sea Trials**\n\nOn 31 October 2019, Cochin Shipyard received a ₹30 billion contract for the Phase-III of the project, which included funds for the harbour trials, sea trials, and support for the ship during its weapons and aviation trials after its delivery. In December 2019, it was reported that the engines had been switched on. By September 2020, Vikrant had completed harbour trials, while the basin trials started from October 2020 to check propulsion, electric transmission, and shafting systems. On 30 November 2020, the basin trials were completed, paving the way for sea trials, the final phase of the IAC-I project.\n\n**Completion and Commissioning**\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi commissioned INS Vikrant on 2 September 2022 in a grand ceremony at Cochin Shipyard. Earlier, INS Vikrant was delivered to the Indian Navy on 28 July 2022. Flight trials of its aircraft complement are expected to be completed by mid-2023, after which the ship will be fully operational.\n\n**Project Delays**\n\nThe construction plan originally called for the carrier to be launched in 2010, with sea trials to commence in 2013, and to be commissioned in 2016. However, the project experienced some delays, including delays in the delivery of main gearboxes, aviation equipment, and cost overruns. The supplier of gearboxes, Elecon, attributed it to technical complexities due to the length of the propulsion shafts.\n\n**Service History**\n\nOn 6 February 2023, two arrested landings and subsequent take-offs were carried out by MiG-29Ks and also by a HAL Tejas Naval.\n\n**Commanding Officers**\n\nThe list of commanding officers of INS Vikrant is not available in the public domain.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe gallery of INS Vikrant is not available in the public domain.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe following topics are related to INS Vikrant:\n\n* INS Vikrant (1944)\n* INS Vishal\n* IAC-2\n* Sea Harrier\n* LCA Navy\n* HAL TEDBF\n* Dassault Rafale M\n* MiG-29K\n\n**External Links**\n\nThe following links provide additional information on INS Vikrant:\n\n* Indian Navy Website\n* Cochin Shipyard Website\n* Defence Ministry Website\n\nNote: The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone and follows the exact outline structure.

it was discontinued in 2002.\n\n\n21st century\nOn July 5, 2005, it was revealed that Coca-Cola would resume operations in Iraq for the first time since the Arab League boycotted the company in 1968 [52]\n\n\nProduction\nA typical can of Coca-Cola (12 fl ounces/355 ml) contains 39 grams of sugar, [65] 46 mg of caffeine, [66] 50 mg of sodium, no fat, no potassium, and 140 calories [67]\n\n\nListed ingredients\nA typical can of Coca-Cola (12 fl ounces/355 ml) contains 39 grams of sugar, [65] 46 mg of caffeine, [66] 50 mg of sodium, no fat, no potassium, and 140 calories [67]\n\n\nFormula of natural flavorings\nThe exact formula for Coca-Cola's natural flavorings is a trade secret (All of its other ingredients are listed on the side of the bottle or can, and are not secret.) The original copy of the formula was held in Truist Financial's main vault in Atlanta for 86 years Its predecessor, the Trust Company, was the underwriter for the Coca-Cola Company's initial public offering in 1919 On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the vault at SunTrust Banks into a new vault; this vault will be on display for visitors to its World of Coca-Cola museum in downtown Atlanta [68]\n\n\nUse of stimulants in formula\n\n\n\nCoca leaf\nPemberton called for five ounces of coca leaf per gallon of syrup (approximately 37 g/L), a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount Coca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass (For comparison, a typical dose or \"line\" of cocaine is 50–75 mg [77]) In 1903, the fresh coca leaves were removed from the formula [78]\n\n\nKola nuts for caffeine\nThe kola nut acts as a flavoring and the original source of caffeine in Coca-Cola It contains about 2.0 to 3.5% caffeine, and has a bitter flavor.\n\n\nFranchised production model\nThe production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, putting the mixture into cans and bottles, and carbonating it, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and foodservice distributors [85]\n\n\nGeographic spread\nCoca-Cola has been sold outside the United States as early as 1900, when the Cuba Libre (a mix between Coca-Cola and rum) was created in Havana shortly after the Spanish-American War of 1898 However, the international reach of the product became mostly limited to North and Central America, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, Germany and parts of Asia until the 1940s, when the brand was introduced throughout South America and then Europe after the end of World War II (Fanta was initially conceived by the German Coca-Cola subsidiary as an emergency replacement as the wartime trade embargo prevented the import of syrup) As a result, Coca-Cola eventually became regarded as one of the major symbols of American soft power as well as of globalization.\n\n\nBrand portfolio\nThis is a list of variants of Coca-Cola introduced around the world In addition to the caffeine-free version of the original, additional fruit flavors have been included over the years Not included here are versions of Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar; these variant versions of those no-calorie colas can be found in their respective articles.\n\n\nLogo design\nThe Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, in 1885 [123] Robinson came up with the name and chose the logo's distinctive cursive script The writing style used, known as Spencerian script, was developed in the mid-19th century and was the dominant form of formal handwriting in the United States during that period [124]\n\n\nContour bottle design\nThe Coca-Cola bottle, called the \"contour bottle\" within the company, was created by bottle designer Earl R Dean and Coca-Cola's general counsel, Harold Hirsch In 1915, the Coca-Cola Company was represented by their general counsel to launch a competition among its bottle suppliers as well as any competition entrants to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles, \"a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was.\" [128] [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nExamples\nKarl Lagerfeld is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca-Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years, including Jean Paul Gaultier [142]\n\n\nDesigner bottles\nKarl Lagerfeld is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca-Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years, including Jean Paul Gaultier [142]\n\n\nCompetitors\nPepsi, the flagship product of PepsiCo, the Coca-Cola Company's main rival in the soft drink industry, is usually second to Coke in sales, and outsells Coca-Cola in some markets RC Cola, now owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the third-largest soft drink manufacturer, is also widely available [145]\n\n\nAdvertising\nCoca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected American culture, and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in a red-and-white suit Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, the motif was already common [155] [156] Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: White Rock Beverages used Santa in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923, after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915 [157] [158] Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress Hilda Clark as its spokeswoman.\n\n\n5 cents\nFrom 1886 to 1959, the price of Coca-Cola was fixed at five cents, in part due to an advertising campaign.\n\n\nHoliday campaigns\nThroughout the years, Coca-Cola has released limited-time collector bottles for Christmas.\n\n\nSports sponsorship\nCoca-Cola was the first commercial sponsor of the Olympic Games, at the 1928 games in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since [189] This corporate sponsorship included the 1996 Summer Olympics hosted in Atlanta, which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010, by changing the ending line of the commercial to say \"Now they know whose game they're playing\" [190]\n\n\nIn mass media\nCoca-Cola has been prominently featured in many films and television programs It was a major plot element in films such as One, Two, Three, The Coca-Cola Kid, and The Gods Must Be Crazy, among many others In music, such as in the Beatles' song, \"Come Together\", the lyrics say, \"He shoot Coca-Cola\" The Beach Boys also referenced Coca-Cola in their 1964 song \"All Summer Long\", singing \"Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?\" [197]\n\n\nUse as political and corporate symbol\nCoca-Cola has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an \"American Brand\" or as an item representing America, criticized as Cocacolonization After World War II, this gave rise to the brief production of White Coke at the request of and for Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who did not want to be seen drinking a symbol of American imperialism The bottles were given by the President Eisenhower during a conference, and Marshal Zhukov enjoyed the drink The bottles were disguised as vodka bottles, with the cap having a red star design, to avoid suspicion of Soviet officials [209]\n\n\nMedicinal application\nCoca-Cola is sometimes used for the treatment of gastric phytobezoars In about 50% of cases studied, Coca-Cola alone was found to be effective in gastric phytobezoar dissolution This treatment can however result in the potential of developing small bowel obstruction in a minority of cases, necessitating surgical intervention [216]\n\n\nCriticism\nCriticism of Coca-Cola has arisen from various groups around the world, concerning a variety of issues, including health effects, environmental issues, and business practices The drink's coca flavoring, and the nickname \"Coke\", remain a common theme of criticism due to the relationship with the illegal drug cocaine In 1911, the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleging the caffeine in its drink was \"injurious to health\", leading to amended food safety legislation [217]\n\n\nColombian death-squad allegations\nIn July 2001, the Coca-Cola Company was sued over its alleged use of far-right death squads (the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia) to kidnap, torture, and kill Colombian bottler workers that were linked with trade union activity Coca-Cola was sued in a US federal court in Miami by the Colombian food and drink union Sinaltrainal The suit alleged that Coca-Cola was indirectly responsible for having \"contracted with or otherwise directed paramilitary security forces that utilized extreme violence and murdered, tortured, unlawfully detained or otherwise silenced trade union leaders\" This sparked campaigns to boycott Coca-Cola in the UK, US, Germany, Italy, and Australia [231] [232] Javier Correa, the president of Sinaltrainal, said the campaign aimed to put pressure on Coca-Cola \"to mitigate the pain and suffering\" that union members had suffered [232]\n\n\nOther uses\nCoca-Cola can be used to remove grease and oil stains from concrete, [234] metal, and clothes [235] It is also used to delay concrete from setting [236]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Coca-Cola**\n\nCoca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink that is one of the most recognized and consumed beverage brands in the world. The drink was invented in the late 19th century by pharmacist John Pemberton and has since become a cultural icon. Coca-Cola is a symbol of American culture and is often associated with the United States.\n\n**History**\n\nThe story of Coca-Cola began in 1886 when John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia, created a new soft drink to be sold at soda fountains. Pemberton's original recipe for Coca-Cola included coca leaves, which contained cocaine, as well as kola nuts, which contained caffeine. The drink was initially marketed as a patent medicine, claiming to cure headaches and relieve fatigue. In 1888, Asa Griggs Candler bought the rights to Coca-Cola and began to market the drink more widely.\n\n**19th Century Origins**\n\nThe origins of Coca-Cola date back to the late 19th century when John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Columbus, Georgia, began experimenting with a new soft drink. Pemberton's coca leaves and kola nuts were sourced from the African and Asian markets, respectively. The drink was initially marketed as a patent medicine, claiming to cure headaches and relieve fatigue. In 1888, Asa Griggs Candler bought the rights to Coca-Cola and began to market the drink more widely.\n\n**Company**\n\nIn 1888, Asa Griggs Candler bought the rights to Coca-Cola from John Pemberton. Candler was a businessman from Atlanta, Georgia, who saw the potential for Coca-Cola to become a successful brand. He invested heavily in marketing and advertising the drink, which helped to increase its popularity. However, Candler was not the only one who was interested in the drink. Charley Pemberton, John Pemberton's son, was also selling a crude version of Coca-Cola called \"Coca-Cola\" under his father's blessing.\n\n**Origins of Bottling**\n\nThe first bottling of Coca-Cola occurred in Vicksburg, Mississippi, at the Biedenharn Candy Company on March 12, 1894. The proprietor of the bottling works was Joseph A Biedenharn. The original bottles were Hutchinson bottles, which were very different from the hobble-skirt design of 1915 that is now familiar.\n\n**20th Century**\n\nIn the early 20th century, Coca-Cola became a national brand in the United States. The drink was marketed as a refreshing beverage that was perfect for hot summer days. In 1935, Coca-Cola was certified kosher by Atlanta rabbi Tobias Geffen. This was a significant milestone for the brand, as it allowed Jewish consumers to enjoy the drink during Passover. A yellow cap on a Coca-Cola drink indicates that it is kosher for Passover.\n\n**Sugar Replaced with High-Fructose Corn Syrup**\n\nIn the 1970s, sugar prices spiked due to Soviet demand and hoarding. As a result, Coca-Cola switched to high-fructose corn syrup in 1974. This change was made to reduce costs and maintain profitability.\n\n**New Coke**\n\nIn 1985, Coca-Cola attempted to change the formula of the drink with \"New Coke.\" The new formula was met with widespread criticism and protest. The company eventually returned to the original formula under the name \"Coca-Cola Classic\" in 1985.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nIn the 21st century, Coca-Cola has continued to expand its operations globally. The company has invested heavily in marketing and advertising, and has introduced new products and variants of its classic drink.\n\n**Production**\n\nA typical can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar, 46 milligrams of caffeine, 50 milligrams of sodium, no fat, no potassium, and 140 calories.\n\n**Listed Ingredients**\n\nA typical can of Coca-Cola contains 39 grams of sugar, 46 milligrams of caffeine, 50 milligrams of sodium, no fat, no potassium, and 140 calories.\n\n**Formula of Natural Flavorings**\n\nThe exact formula for Coca-Cola's natural flavorings is a trade secret. The original copy of the formula was held in Truist Financial's main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. In 2011, the formula was moved to a new vault at the World of Coca-Cola museum in downtown Atlanta.\n\n**Use of Stimulants in Formula**\n\nCoca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass. In 1903, the fresh coca leaves were removed from the formula. The kola nut acts as a flavoring and the original source of caffeine in Coca-Cola.\n\n**Franchised Production Model**\n\nThe production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, putting the mixture into cans and bottles, and carbonating it.\n\n**Geographic Spread**\n\nCoca-Cola has been sold outside the United States as early as 1900, when the Cuba Libre was created in Havana. The international reach of the product became mostly limited to North and Central America, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, Germany, and parts of Asia until the 1940s. After World War II, the brand was introduced throughout South America and then Europe.\n\n**Brand Portfolio**\n\nThis is a list of variants of Coca-Cola introduced around the world. In addition to the caffeine-free version of the original, additional fruit flavors have been included over the years.\n\n**Logo Design**\n\nThe Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton's bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, in 1885. Robinson came up with the name and chose the logo's distinctive cursive script.\n\n**Contour Bottle Design**\n\nThe Coca-Cola bottle, called the \"contour bottle\" within the company, was created by bottle designer Earl R Dean and Coca-Cola's general counsel, Harold Hirsch. In 1915, the Coca-Cola Company was represented by their general counsel to launch a competition among its bottle suppliers as well as any competition entrants to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles.\n\n**Designer Bottles**\n\nA number of limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca-Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years. Karl Lagerfeld is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nPepsi, the flagship product of PepsiCo, is usually second to Coke in sales, and outsells Coca-Cola in some markets. RC Cola, now owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, is also widely available.\n\n**Advertising**\n\nCoca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected American culture, and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as an old man in a red-and-white suit. Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising.\n\n**5 Cents**\n\nFrom 1886 to 1959, the price of Coca-Cola was fixed at five cents, in part due to an advertising campaign.\n\n**Holiday Campaigns**\n\nThroughout the years, Coca-Cola has released limited-time collector bottles for Christmas.\n\n**Sports Sponsorship**\n\nCoca-Cola was the first commercial sponsor of the Olympic Games, at the 1928 games in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since. This corporate sponsorship included the 1996 Summer Olympics hosted in Atlanta, which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown.\n\n**In Mass Media**\n\nCoca-Cola has been prominently featured in many films and television programs. Coca-Cola was a major plot element in films such as One, Two, Three, The Coca-Cola Kid, and The Gods Must Be Crazy, among many others.\n\n**Use as Political and Corporate Symbol**\n\nCoca-Cola has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an \"American Brand\" or as an item representing America. Criticized as Cocacolonization, Coca-Cola has been used as a political and corporate symbol in various contexts.\n\n**Medicinal Application**\n\nCoca-Cola is sometimes used for the treatment of gastric phytobezoars. In about 50% of cases studied, Coca-Cola alone was found to be effective in gastric phytobezoar dissolution.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nCoca-Cola has been criticized for a variety of issues, including health effects, environmental issues, and business practices. The drink's coca flavoring, and the nickname \"Coke\", remain a common theme of criticism due to the relationship with the illegal drug cocaine.\n\n**Colombian Death-Squad Allegations**\n\nIn July 2001, the Coca-Cola Company was sued over its alleged use of far-right death squads (the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia) to kidnap, torture, and kill Colombian bottler workers that were linked with trade union activity.\n\n**Other Uses**\n\nCoca-Cola can be used to remove grease and oil stains from concrete, metal, and clothes. It is also used to delay concrete from setting.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Coca-Cola\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nConfederate Colonel John Pemberton, wounded in the American Civil War and addicted to morphine, also had a medical degree and began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug [8] In 1885 at Pemberton's Eagle Drug and Chemical House, his drugstore in Columbus, Georgia, he registered Pemberton's French Wine Coca nerve tonic [9] [10] [11] [12] Pemberton's tonic may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, a French-Corsican coca wine, [13] but his recipe additionally included the African kola nut, the beverage's source of caffeine [14] A Spanish drink called \"Kola Coca\" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953 [15] [16]\n\n\n19th century origins\nConfederate Colonel John Pemberton, wounded in the American Civil War and addicted to morphine, also had a medical degree and began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug [8] In 1885 at Pemberton's Eagle Drug and Chemical House, his drugstore in Columbus, Georgia, he registered Pemberton's French Wine Coca nerve tonic [9] [10] [11] [12] Pemberton's tonic may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, a French-Corsican coca wine, [13] but his recipe additionally included the African kola nut, the beverage's source of caffeine [14] A Spanish drink called \"Kola Coca\" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953 [15] [16]\n\n\nCompany\nAfter Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names \"Yum Yum\" and \"Koke\" This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name \"Coca-Cola\", all with his father's blessing After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well [26]\n\n\nOrigins of bottling\nThe first bottling of Coca-Cola occurred in Vicksburg, Mississippi, at the Biedenharn Candy Company on March 12, 1894 [35] The proprietor of the bottling works was Joseph A Biedenharn [36] The original bottles were Hutchinson bottles, very different from the much later hobble-skirt design of 1915 now so familiar.\n\n\n20th century\nThe first outdoor wall advertisement that promoted the Coca-Cola drink was painted in 1894 in Cartersville, Georgia [40] Cola syrup was sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement for upset stomach [41] [42] By the time of its 50th anniversary, the soft drink had reached the status of a national icon in the US In 1935, it was certified kosher by Atlanta rabbi Tobias Geffen With the help of Harold Hirsch, Geffen was the first person outside the company to see the top-secret ingredients list after Coke faced scrutiny from the American Jewish population regarding the drink's kosher status [43] Consequently, the company made minor changes in the sourcing of some ingredients so it could continue to be consumed by America's Jewish population, including during Passover [44] A yellow cap on a Coca-Cola drink indicates that it is kosher for Passover [45]\n\n\nSugar replaced with high-fructose corn syrup\nSugar prices spiked in the 1970s because of Soviet demand/hoarding and possible futures contracts market manipulation The Soviet Union was the largest producer of sugar at the time In 1974 Coca-Cola switched over to high-fructose corn syrup because of the elevated prices [49] [50]\n\n\nNew Coke\nOn April 23, 1985, Coca-Cola, amid much publicity, attempted to change the formula of the drink with \"New Coke\" Follow-up taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both old Coke and Pepsi [51] but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's nostalgia for the old drink, leading to a backlash The company gave in to protests and returned to the old formula under the name Coca-Cola Classic, on July 10, 1985 \"New Coke\" remained available and was renamed Coke II in 1992;

Hellwig was an amateur bodybuilder, [7] competing in a number of NPC contests and winning the 1984 NPC Mr Georgia crown [8] Hellwig started training with weights when he was 11 years old and described himself as \"the small, insecure kid who wasn't into any sports\" [7] He moved to California where, after seeing bodybuilder Robby Robinson, he decided to take up the sport His first contest took place in Florida, where he placed 5th Later, while he was attending Life University in Marietta, Georgia, he won the Junior Atlanta contest and placed 5th at the 1981 AAU Collegiate Mr America In

Rick Bassman [13] Hellwig and fellow trainee Steve Borden (who later had success as \"Sting\") formed a tag team called The Freedom Fighters (Hellwig was known as Justice and Borden was called Flash).\n\n\nContinental Wrestling Association (1985–1986)\nHellwig began his professional wrestling career as Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig of Powerteam USA, the group of bodybuilders trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman [13] Hellwig and fellow trainee Steve Borden (who later had success as \"Sting\") formed a tag team called The Freedom Fighters (Hellwig was known as Justice and Borden was called Flash).\n\n\nUniversal Wrestling Federation (1986)\nIn March 1986, the Freedom Fighters – now known as the Blade Runners – joined the Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) Hellwig was \"Blade Runner Rock\" and Borden was \"Blade Runner Sting\" According to Joseph Laurinaitis (aka Road Warrior Animal), UWF owner Bill Watts created the Blade Runners and the intent was to make them a parody of The Road Warriors [16] They were part of Eddie Gilbert's Hotstuff International group, before disbanding in June 1986 when Hellwig left the UWF [17]\n\n\nWorld Class Championship Wrestling (1986–1987)\nIn June 1986, Warrior debuted in the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) promotion, where he wrestled for $50 a night He has stated that he adopted the ring name \"Dingo Warrior\" after a member of the WCCW locker room remarked that he looked like \"a warrior\" [10] This stood in contrast with a claim made by Road Warrior Animal, who stated that the Dingo Warrior was a recreation of Warrior's Blade Runner gimmick and was an attempt to present himself as an offspring of The Road Warriors [16]\n\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1987–1992)\nHellwig joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987 First competing on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated a series of jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, [22] Barry Horowitz [23] and Mike Sharpe [24] He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of Wrestling Challenge, where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs [25] As The Ultimate Warrior character, Hellwig became known for his impassioned babbling, incomprehensible commentary and high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ring ropes up and down He was also known for his distinctive pattern of face paint After several months of defeating jobbers, he was pinned for the first time in the WWF by fellow WWF rookie/future rival Rick Rude on December 28, 1987 [26] In early 1988, Warrior entered into his first real WWF feud with fellow strongman Hercules Hernandez The two faced off on the February 7, 1988, airing of Wrestling Challenge, where Hercules was disqualified for using his steel chain [27] Warrior then grabbed ahold of the chain and in the midst of a tug of war over it, the chain snapped [27] This led to a match at WrestleMania IV, where Warrior was victorious in his pay-per-view debut [26] Warrior lost twice by pinfall shortly thereafter: cleanly to André the Giant in April in Italy, [28] and to Dino Bravo, who put his feet on the ropes for leverage, in Montreal in June [29] In the summer of 1988, he wrestled Bobby Heenan in a series of weasel suit matches, in which Warrior won by sleeper hold.\n\n\nEarly push (1987–1988)\nHellwig joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987 First competing on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he

summer of 1988, he wrestled Bobby Heenan in a series of weasel suit matches, in which Warrior won by sleeper hold.\n\n\nIntercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1988–1990)\nLess than a year after his WWF television debut, Warrior, a surprise substitute for the injured Brutus Beefcake, won the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, defeating The Honky Tonk Man in a 27-second squash match at the inaugural SummerSlam on August 29, 1988, and ending Honky Tonk's long reign at 454 days [26] As champion, he captained a team at Survivor Series '88, where he was the sole survivor, pinning Outlaw Ron Bass and Greg Valentine in succession to win the match for his team [26]\n\n\nWWF Champion (1990–1991)\nThe Warrior received a push as WWF's main event level successor to Hulk Hogan, who had remained wrestling's biggest star throughout the 1980s Following a few confrontations with Hogan, most notably at the 1990 Royal Rumble, the Warrior was written in as Hogan's opponent in the main event for WrestleMania VI at the SkyDome in Toronto The match was billed as \"The Ultimate Challenge\", as both Hogan's WWF Championship and Warrior's Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship were on the line Warrior pinned Hogan after a Warrior Splash to become the only wrestler to hold both championships simultaneously [31] Warrior vacated the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship (which Mr Perfect then won in a tournament), as WWF rules prohibited a wrestler from holding both titles [32]\n\n\nVarious feuds (1991–1992)\nThe next chapter of Warrior's career was an encounter with The Undertaker, after Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer, locked Warrior in a coffin on the set of Bearer's Funeral Parlor WWF officials worked feverishly to break the casket open, finally revealing Warrior's seemingly lifeless body, and the torn fabric inside of the coffin indicating Warrior's desperate struggle to get out Warrior was finally revived by the officials performing CPR (It was later revealed in a 2010 interview with Bearer that, in preparation for the segment, he and his team had to remove the airtight rubber seal or \"gasket\" from around the coffin's lid and drill air holes in said lid to allow for breathable space, so that Warrior would not suffocate because \"he had enough brain damage as it was, and we wouldn't want to give him any more\", implying that Warrior had been faking his own death the whole time [34]) This led to Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts offering to give Warrior \"the knowledge of the dark side\" in order to prepare Warrior to take his revenge on the Undertaker This involved Roberts giving Warrior three \"tests\" shown on WWF television in consecutive weeks For the first test, Roberts locked Warrior once again inside the same coffin as previously [35]\n\n\nSemi-retirement (1992–1996)\nBetween November 1992 and July 1995, Warrior was semi-retired During his time away from the WWF, Warrior opened the short-lived \"Warrior University\", a professional wrestling school based in Scottsdale, Arizona [50]\n\n\nReturn to the World Wrestling Federation (1996)\nWarrior returned to the WWF on March 31, 1996, defeating Hunter Hearst Helmsley at WrestleMania XII [54] He made his first appearance on Monday Night Raw on April 8, where he gave an in-ring interview and credited the \"voices\" of the \"warriors\" (his name for members of the WWF audience) for his return; he was then interrupted by Goldust [55] Warrior challenged for Goldust's Intercontinental Championship at In Your House 7; Warrior won the match by countout, but did not win the title [1] The following night on Monday Night Raw, Warrior defeated Isaac Yankem, DDS [1] A rematch with Intercontinental Champion Goldust, on the May 27 episode of the show, ended in a double countout, thus eliminating both men from the tournament and eventually giving Vader a bye into the semi-finals [1] Warrior defeated Jerry Lawler at King of the Ring, [1] and defeated Owen Hart by

professional wrestler born James Brian Hellwig on June 16, 1959, in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was one of the most iconic and recognizable figures in professional wrestling history, known for his intense and passionate performances in the ring.\n\nEarly Life\n\nWarrior was born in 1959 as James Brian Hellwig, the oldest of five children, to a family of modest means. His father left the family when he was just 12 years old, and his mother later remarried. Warrior's grandfather died at 52, and his father died at 57, which had a significant impact on his life. He described himself as a \"small, insecure kid\" who wasn't into any sports, but he started training with weights at the age of 11.\n\nBodybuilding Career\n\nPrior to his career in professional wrestling, Hellwig was an amateur bodybuilder, competing in numerous NPC contests and winning the 1984 NPC Mr. Georgia crown. He started training with weights at 11 and moved to California, where he was inspired by bodybuilder Robby Robinson to take up the sport. His first contest took place in Florida, where he placed 5th. In 1983, he won the AAU Coastal USA, before taking the Mr. Georgia title the following year. His last bodybuilding contest was the 1985 Junior USAs, which was won by future IFBB Pro, Ron Love, where he finished 5th.\n\nProfessional Wrestling Career\n\nHellwig began his professional wrestling career as Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig of Powerteam USA, a group of bodybuilders trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman. He and fellow trainee Steve Borden formed a tag team called The Freedom Fighters, with Hellwig as \"Justice\" and Borden as \"Flash.\"\n\nContinental Wrestling Association (1985-1986)\n\nHellwig began his professional wrestling career as Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig of Powerteam USA, a group of bodybuilders trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman. He and fellow trainee Steve Borden formed a tag team called The Freedom Fighters, with Hellwig as \"Justice\" and Borden as \"Flash.\"\n\nUniversal Wrestling Federation (1986)\n\nIn March 1986, the Freedom Fighters, now known as the Blade Runners, joined the Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). Hellwig was \"Blade Runner Rock\" and Borden was \"Blade Runner Sting.\" According to Joseph Laurinaitis (aka Road Warrior Animal), UWF owner Bill Watts created the Blade Runners, and the intent was to make them a parody of The Road Warriors. They were part of Eddie Gilbert's Hotstuff International group, before disbanding in June 1986 when Hellwig left the UWF.\n\nWorld Class Championship Wrestling (1986-1987)\n\nIn June 1986, Warrior debuted in the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) promotion, where he wrestled for $50 a night. He has stated that he adopted the ring name \"Dingo Warrior\" after a member of the WCCW locker room remarked that he looked like \"a warrior.\" This stood in contrast with a claim made by Road Warrior Animal, who stated that the Dingo Warrior was a recreation of Warrior's Blade Runner gimmick and was an attempt to present himself as an offspring of The Road Warriors.\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1987-1992)\n\nHellwig joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987. First competing on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated a series of jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, Barry Horowitz, and Mike Sharpe. He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of Wrestling Challenge, where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs. As The Ultimate Warrior character, Hellwig became known for his impassioned babbling, incomprehensible commentary, and high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ring ropes up and down.\n\nIntercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1988-1990)\n\nLess than a year after his WWF television debut, Warrior, a surprise substitute for the injured Brutus Beefcake, won the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, defeating The Honky Tonk Man in a 27-second squash match at the inaugural SummerSlam on August 29, 1988, and ending Honky Tonk's long reign at 454 days. As champion, he captained a team at Survivor Series '88, where he was the sole survivor, pinning Outlaw Ron Bass and Greg Valentine in succession to win the match for his team.\n\nWWF Champion (1990-1991)\n\nThe Warrior received a push as WWF's main event level successor to Hulk Hogan, who had remained wrestling's biggest star throughout the 1980s. Following a few confrontations with Hogan, most notably at the 1990 Royal Rumble, the Warrior was written in as Hogan's opponent in the main event for WrestleMania VI at the SkyDome in Toronto. The match was billed as \"The Ultimate Challenge,\" as both Hogan's WWF Championship and Warrior's Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Warrior pinned Hogan after a Warrior Splash to become the only wrestler to hold both championships simultaneously. Warrior vacated the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship (which Mr. Perfect then won in a tournament), as WWF rules prohibited a wrestler from holding both titles.\n\nVarious Feuds (1991-1992)\n\nThe next chapter of Warrior's career was an encounter with The Undertaker, after Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer, locked Warrior in a coffin on the set of Bearer's Funeral Parlor. This led to Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts offering to give Warrior \"the knowledge of the dark side\" in order to prepare Warrior to take his revenge on the Undertaker. This involved Roberts giving Warrior three \"tests\" shown on WWF television in consecutive weeks.\n\nSemi-Retirement (1992-1996)\n\nBetween November 1992 and July 1995, Warrior was semi-retired. During his time away from the WWF, Warrior opened the short-lived \"Warrior University,\" a professional wrestling school based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nReturn to the World Wrestling Federation (1996)\n\nWarrior returned to the WWF on March 31, 1996, defeating Hunter Hearst Helmsley at WrestleMania XII. He made his first appearance on Monday Night Raw on April 8, where he gave an in-ring interview and credited the \"voices\" of the \"warriors\" (his name for members of the WWF audience) for his return; he was then interrupted by Goldust.\n\nWorld Championship Wrestling (1998)\n\nWCW signed Warrior \"at great expense\" in May 1998. He formed a stable opposing Hollywood Hulk Hogan's New World Order (nWo): the \"One Warrior Nation\" using the initialism oWn as a play on the name nWo.\n\nNu-Wrestling Evolution (2008)\n\nAfter retiring in 1998, Warrior only wrestled a single match on June 25, 2008, against Orlando Jordan in Barcelona, Spain.

In the same clip, he spoke positively about Vince McMahon for the first time on his channel.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nWarrior married Shari Lynn Tyree on October 2, 1982. They remained together for the majority of Warrior's WWF career before divorcing on March 22, 1991, two days before WrestleMania VII. Warrior married for the second time to Dana Viale on January 31, 1999.

{"title": "Greta_Gerwig", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nGerwig was born in Sacramento, California, and grew up in the River Park neighborhood [12] She is the daughter of Christine, an OB-GYN nurse, and Gordon Gerwig, who worked for a credit union on small business loans [12] [13] She is close to her parents and they make an appearance in Frances Ha as her character's parents [13] She has an older brother, a landscape architect, and a sister, a manager at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [14] [15] [16] Gerwig has German ancestry [15]\n\n\nCareer\nGerwig originally intended to become a playwright, but she turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs [13] In 2006, while still studying at Barnard, she was cast in a minor role in Joe Swanberg's LOL, and appeared in Baghead by Jay and Mark Duplass She began a partnership with Swanberg, which resulted in the duo's co-writing Hannah Takes the Stairs (2007), and sharing both writing and directing duties on Nights and Weekends (2008) Through these films, she became known as a key figure in the rising mumblecore film movement [2] [3] and was often referred to as an \"it girl\" [5] [25] [26] Despite her consistent association with the movement, Gerwig dislikes the term \"mumblecore\", and has defended the style by saying, \"People had gotten used to a version of a movie at a film festival that was like a calling-card for the real movie you were going to make later What was different about these movies was these filmmakers were like, 'There is not another movie This is the real movie.'\" [27]\n\n\n2006–2009: Early work\nGerwig originally intended to become a playwright, but she turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs [13] In 2006, while still studying at Barnard, she was cast in a minor role in Joe Swanberg's LOL, and appeared in Baghead by Jay and Mark Duplass She began a partnership with Swanberg, which resulted in the duo's co-writing Hannah Takes the Stairs (2007), and sharing both writing and directing duties on Nights and Weekends (2008) Through these films, she became known as a key figure in the rising mumblecore film movement [2] [3] and was often referred to as an \"it girl\" [5] [25] [26] Despite her consistent association with the movement, Gerwig dislikes the term \"mumblecore\", and has defended the style by saying, \"People had gotten used to a version of a movie at a film festival that was like a calling-card for the real movie you were going to make later What was different about these movies was these filmmakers were like, 'There is not another movie This is the real movie.'\" [27]\n\n\n2010–2016: Independent films\nIn 2010, Gerwig starred in Noah Baumbach's Greenberg with Ben Stiller, Rhys Ifans, and Jennifer Jason Leigh [29] [30] In an appraisal of her work in this and other films, The New York Times critic A O Scott described Gerwig as an \"ambassador of a cinematic style that often seems opposed to the very idea of style.\" \"She seems to be embarked on a project,\" Scott wrote, \"however piecemeal and modestly scaled, of redefining just what it is we talk about when we talk about acting.\" [31] In 2010, Gerwig made her first talk show appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! From 2011 to 2015, she voiced Pony, one of the main characters in the Adult Swim animated series China, IL In 2011, she was cast as a lead in an HBO pilot adaptation of The Corrections, which however was not picked up to series [20] Also that year she starred in Whit Stillman's comedy Damsels in Distress (2011) which premiered at the Venice International Film Festival Critic Roger Ebert compared the film favorably to the novels of P.G Wodehouse and praised Gerwig's performance, writing \"He's also lucky to have found an actress in Gerwig who finds the perfect note for playing a woman who knows everything better than you do, but doesn't believe she's being stuck up about it; she's just being kind.\" [32] In 2012, Gerwig appeared in Woody Allen's film To Rome with Love in the vignette John's Story, acting alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Alec Baldwin [33]\n\n\n2017–2019: Directorial focus\nIn 2017, Gerwig made her solo directorial debut (after having co-directed Nights and Weekends) with the coming-of-age comedy-drama film Lady Bird, which she also wrote [52] It starred Saoirse Ronan in the title role [53] Lady Bird premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was theatrically released in November 2017 The film grossed over $78 million against its $10 million budget worldwide Lady Bird received critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly lauding Gerwig's screenplay and direction [54] [55] The film was chosen by the National Board of Review, the American Film Institute, and Time magazine as one of the top ten films of 2017 [56] [57] [58] According to the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it was given 196 positive reviews in a row, making it the record-holder for the most \"fresh\" reviews, [59] until the first \"rotten\" one arrived in December 2017 [60] As of 2019, it had a 99% rating on the aforementioned website [61]\n\n\n2020–present: Barbie and new projects\nGerwig co-starred with Adam Driver in Baumbach's 2022 film White Noise, adapted from the novel of the same name by Don DeLillo for Netflix The movie opened both the 79th Venice International Film Festival and the 60th New York Film Festival and was made available on the streaming platform in late 2022 [71] Gerwig also directed and co-wrote with Baumbach the fantasy comedy Barbie for Warner Bros Pictures, based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel It finished filming in 2022 and opened theatrically on July 21, 2023 The movie features Margot Robbie in the title role alongside Ryan Gosling (as the doll Ken) [72] [73] [74] The film was a commercial success, and eventually crossed the $1 billion gross mark worldwide, making Gerwig the first woman with sole director credit to have a movie make more than $1 billion at the global box office [75] It received critical acclaim and other accolades, including eight Academy Award nominations, among them Gerwig for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n\nDirectorial style\nGerwig's films tend to be based on her own experiences  In a behind-the-scenes video on the set of Lady Bird she said, \"I tend to start with things from my own life, then pretty quickly they spin out into their own orbit.\" [80] Gerwig presses her actors to incorporate their personalities into their performances as well, and says of her writing and directing, \"it's all about actors.\" [80] By contrast, she allows little line improvisation and the script is followed fairly closely [13]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGerwig lives in Manhattan with her husband, filmmaker Noah Baumbach, whom she married in 2023 after 12 years together [88] [89] [90] They have two sons together, born in March 2019 and February 2023 [91] [92]\n\n\nActing credits\nIn 2011, Gerwig won an award from the Athena Film Festival for her artistry as one of

Gerwig\n\nGreta Gerwig is an American actress, screenwriter, and film director. She was born on August 4, 1983, in Sacramento, California, and grew up in the River Park neighborhood. Gerwig is the daughter of Christine, an OB-GYN nurse, and Gordon Gerwig, a credit union employee. She is close to her parents and they make an appearance in her film Frances Ha as her character's parents. Gerwig has an older brother, a landscape architect, and a sister, a manager at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She has German ancestry.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nGerwig was born and raised in Sacramento, California. She grew up in a close-knit family with her parents and siblings. Gerwig's parents encouraged her to pursue her passions, and she developed a love for the arts at an early age. She attended Sacramento's American River College, where she studied English and played soccer. After college, Gerwig moved to New York City to pursue a career in the arts.\n\n**Career**\n\nGerwig originally intended to become a playwright, but she turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs. In 2006, while still studying at Barnard, she was cast in a minor role in Joe Swanberg's LOL, and appeared in Baghead by Jay and Mark Duplass. She began a partnership with Swanberg, which resulted in the duo's co-writing Hannah Takes the Stairs (2007), and sharing both writing and directing duties on Nights and Weekends (2008). Through these films, she became known as a key figure in the rising mumblecore film movement. Despite her consistent association with the movement, Gerwig dislikes the term \"mumblecore\", and has defended the style by saying, \"People had gotten used to a version of a movie at a film festival that was like a calling-card for the real movie you were going to make later. What was different about these movies was these filmmakers were like, 'There is not another movie. This is the real movie.'\"\n\n**2006–2009: Early Work**\n\nGerwig originally intended to become a playwright, but she turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs.

What was different about these movies was these filmmakers were like, 'There is not another movie. This is the real movie.'\"\n\n**2010–2016: Independent Films**\n\nIn 2010, Gerwig starred in Noah Baumbach's Greenberg with Ben Stiller, Rhys Ifans, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. In an appraisal of her work in this and other films, The New York Times critic A O Scott described Gerwig as an \"ambassador of a cinematic style that often seems opposed to the very idea of style.\" \"She seems to be embarked on a project,\" Scott wrote, \"however piecemeal and modestly scaled, of redefining just what it is we talk about when we talk about acting.\" In 2010, Gerwig made her first talk show appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! From 2011 to 2015, she voiced Pony, one of the main characters in the Adult Swim animated series China, IL. In 2011, she was cast as a lead in an HBO pilot adaptation of The Corrections, which however was not picked up to series. Also that year she starred in Whit Stillman's comedy Damsels in Distress (2011) which premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. Critic Roger Ebert compared the film favorably to the novels of P.G Wodehouse and praised Gerwig's performance, writing \"He's also lucky to have found an actress in Gerwig who finds the perfect note for playing a woman who knows everything better than you do, but doesn't believe she's being stuck up about it; she's just being kind.\" In 2012, Gerwig appeared in Woody Allen's film To Rome with Love in the vignette John's Story, acting alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Alec Baldwin.\n\n**2017–2019: Directorial Focus**\n\nIn 2017, Gerwig made her solo directorial debut (after having co-directed Nights and Weekends) with the coming-of-age comedy-drama film Lady Bird, which she also wrote. It starred Saoirse Ronan in the title role. Lady Bird premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was theatrically released in November 2017. The film grossed over $78 million against its $10 million budget worldwide. Lady Bird received critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly lauding Gerwig's screenplay and direction. The film was chosen by the National Board of Review, the American Film Institute, and Time magazine as one of the top ten films of 2017. According to the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it was given 196 positive reviews in a row, making it the record-holder for the most \"fresh\" reviews, until the first \"rotten\" one arrived in December 2017. As of 2019, it had a 99% rating on the aforementioned website.\n\n**2020–present: Barbie and New Projects**\n\nGerwig co-starred with Adam Driver in Baumbach's 2022 film White Noise, adapted from the novel of the same name by Don DeLillo for Netflix. The movie opened both the 79th Venice International Film Festival and the 60th New York Film Festival and was made available on the streaming platform in late 2022. Gerwig also directed and co-wrote with Baumbach the fantasy comedy Barbie for Warner Bros Pictures, based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel. It finished filming in 2022 and opened theatrically on July 21, 2023. The movie features Margot Robbie in the title role alongside Ryan Gosling (as the doll Ken). The film was a commercial success, and eventually crossed the $1 billion gross mark worldwide, making Gerwig the first woman with sole director credit to have a movie make more than $1 billion at the global box office. It received critical acclaim and other accolades, including eight Academy Award nominations, among them Gerwig for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n**Directorial Style**\n\nGerwig's films tend to be based on her own experiences. In a behind-the-scenes video on the set of Lady Bird she said, \"I tend to start with things from my own life, then pretty quickly they spin out into their own orbit.\" Gerwig presses her actors to incorporate their personalities into their performances as well, and says of her writing and directing, \"it's all about actors.\" By contrast, she allows little line improvisation and the script is followed fairly closely.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGerwig lives in Manhattan with her husband, filmmaker Noah Baumbach, whom she married in 2023 after 12 years together. They have two sons together, born in March 2019 and February 2023.\n\n**Acting Credits**\n\nIn 2011, Gerwig won an award from the Athena Film Festival for her artistry as one of Hollywood's definitive screen actresses of her generation. In 2018, her nomination for Best Director at the 90th Academy Awards for Lady Bird made her the first woman in eight years (and one of only five women in Oscar history) to have been nominated in that category.

{"title": "Unification_Church", "content": "\nPopular terminologies\nMoon did not originally intend to found a separate organization or denomination, [16] and did not give his group of followers its official name, Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (세계 기독교 통일 신령 협회; Segye Gidoggyo Tong-il Sinryeong Hyeobhoe), until 1954 [17] The informal name \"Unification Church\" (통일교; Tongilgyo) has been commonly used by members, the public, and the news media [18] By 2018, the term \"Unification Movement\" was also widely used [19]\n\n\nHistory\nOn February 25, 1920, Moon was born Mun Yong-myeong in Sangsa-ri (상사리; 上思里), Deogun-myon (덕언면), Jeongju-gun, North P'yŏng'an Province, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule His birthday was recorded as January 6 by the traditional lunar calendar (February 25, 1920, according to the Gregorian Calendar) [30] Around 1930, his family, who followed traditional Confucianist beliefs, converted to Christianity and joined a Presbyterian Church, where he later taught Sunday school [31]\n\n\nBackground and origins\nOn February 25, 1920, Moon was born Mun Yong-myeong in Sangsa-ri (상사리; 上思里), Deogun-myon (덕언면), Jeongju-gun, North P'yŏng'an Province, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule His birthday was recorded as January 6 by the traditional lunar calendar (February 25, 1920, according to the Gregorian Calendar) [30] Around 1930, his family, who followed traditional Confucianist beliefs, converted to Christianity and joined a Presbyterian Church, where he later taught Sunday school [31]\n\n\nHoly Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (1954–1994)\nMoon founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC) in Seoul on May 1, 1954 It expanded rapidly in South Korea and, by the end of 1955, had 30 centers nationwide [17] The HSA-UWC expanded throughout the world, with most members living in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other nations in East Asia [37] [17] In the 1970s, American HSA-UWC members were noted for raising money for Unification Church projects [38]\n\n\nFamily Federation for World Peace and Unification (1994–present)\nOn May 1, 1994 (the 40th anniversary of the founding of the HSA-UWC), Moon declared that the era of the HSA-UWC had ended and inaugurated a new organization: the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU) would include HSA-UWC members and members of other religious organizations working toward common goals, especially on issues of sexual morality and reconciliation between people of different religions, nations, and races The FFWPU co-sponsored Blessing ceremonies in which thousands of couples from other churches and religions were given the marriage blessing previously given only to HSA-UWC members [62]\n\n\nMoon's death and divisions within the Unification Church\nOn August 15, 2012, Moon was reported to be gravely ill and was put on a respirator at the intensive care unit of St Mary's Hospital at The Catholic University of Korea in Seoul He was admitted on August 14, 2012, after suffering from pneumonia earlier in the month [78] He died there on September 3 [79]\n\n\nBeliefs\nMoon's book, The Divine Principle, was, he claimed, revealed to him over a period of nine years after he claimed Jesus appeared to him on Easter Sunday 1936 on the mountainside and asked him to continue the work that he could not finish while he was on earth, due to the \"tragedy\" of his crucifixion [84] It was first published as Wolli Wonbon (원리 원본; 原理原本, 'Original Text of the Divine Principle') in 1945 The earliest manuscript was lost in North Korea during the Korean War A second, expanded version, Wonli Hesol (원리 해설; 原理解說), or Explanation of the Divine Principle, was published in 1957 The Divine Principle   [ko] or Exposition of the Divine Principle (원리강론; 原理講論; Wolli Gangnon) is the main theological textbook of the movement It was co-written by Sun Myung Moon and early disciple Hyo Won'eu and first published in 1966 A translation entitled Divine Principle was published in English in 1973 [85] The Divine Principle lays out the core of Unification Church theology and is held by its believers to have the status of holy scripture Following the format of systematic theology, it includes God's purpose in creating human beings, the fall of man, and restoration – the process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended [86] David Václavík and Dušan Lužný described the details of those three points as follows:\n\n\nTraditions\nThe Unification Church is well known for its Blessing tradition: a mass wedding ceremony (합동결혼식) and wedding vow renewal ceremony It is given to engaged or married couples According to the Church's belief in a serpent seed interpretation of original sin and the Fall of Man, Eve was sexually seduced by Satan (the serpent), and thus the human bloodline is sinful due to being directly descended from Satan [90] [91] Through the Blessing, members believe, the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and restored back into God's sinless lineage.\n\n\nBlessing ceremony\nThe Unification Church is well known for its Blessing tradition: a mass wedding ceremony (합동결혼식) and wedding vow renewal ceremony It is given to engaged or married couples According to the Church's belief in a serpent seed interpretation of original sin and the Fall of Man, Eve was sexually seduced by Satan (the serpent), and thus the human bloodline is sinful due to being directly descended from Satan [90] [91] Through the Blessing, members believe, the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and restored back into God's sinless lineage.\n\n\nHoly days\nHoly Days of the Unification Church: [104]\n\n\nScholarly studies\nIn the early 1960s, John Lofland lived with HSA-UWC missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of American members and studied their promotional and proselytization activities Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members—often family relationships Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled \"The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes\", and in a 1966 book by Prentice-Hall, Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nRelations with other religions\nUnificationism holds that the Jewish people as a whole were prepared by God to receive the Messiah in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, with John the Baptist tasked from birth with the mission to lead the Jewish people to Jesus, but failed in his mission According to the Divine Principle, the Jews went through a \"course of indemnity\" due to the failure of John the Baptist to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, in spite of publicly testifying to him at the Jordan River, whilst receiving the baptism [119]\n\n\nJudaism\nUnificationism holds that the Jewish people as a whole were prepared by God to receive the Messiah in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, with John the Baptist tasked from birth with the mission to lead the Jewish people to Jesus, but failed in his mission According to the Divine Principle, the Jews went through a \"course of indemnity\" due to the failure of John the Baptist to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, in spite of publicly testifying to him at the Jordan River, whilst receiving the baptism [119]\n\n\nChristianity\nProtestant commentators have criticized Unification Church teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone [128] In their influential book The Kingdom of the Cults (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K Zacharias disagreed with the Divine Principle on the issues of Christology, the virgin birth of Jesus, the movement's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, and a literal resurrection of Jesus as well as a literal Second Coming [129]\n\n\nIslam\nThe Divine Principle lists the Muslim world as one of the world's four major divisions (the others being East Asia, Hindu, and Christendom) [142] Unification movement support for Islamist anti-communists came to public attention in 1987 when church member Lee Shapiro was killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War while filming a documentary [143] [144] The resistance group they were traveling with reported that they had been ambushed by military forces of the Soviet Union or the Afghan government However, the details have been questioned, partly because of the poor reputation of the group's leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar [145] [146]\n\n\nInterfaith activities\nIn 2009 the FFWPU held an interfaith event in the Congress of the Republic of Peru [159] Former president of the Congress Marcial Ayaipoma [160] and other notable politicians were called \"Ambassadors for Peace\" of the Unification Church [161] [162] [163] [164] In 2010, the church built a large interfaith temple in Seoul [165] Author Deepak Chopra was the keynote speaker at an interfaith event of the Unification Church co-hosted with the United Nations at the headquarters of the United Nations [166] In 2011, an interfaith event was held at the National Assembly of Thailand, the President of the National Assembly of Thailand attended the event [167]\n\n\nScience\nThe Divine Principle calls for the unification of science and religion: \"Religion and science, each in their own spheres, have been the methods of searching for truth in order to conquer ignorance and attain knowledge Eventually, the way of religion and the way of science should be integrated and their problems resolved in one united undertaking; the two aspects of truth, internal and external, should develop in full consonance.\"\n\n\nPolitical activism\nDefunct\n\n\nAnti-communism\nIn the 1940s, Moon cooperated with Communist Party members in support of the Korean independence movement against Imperial Japan After the Korean War (1950–1953), he became an outspoken anti-communist [157] Moon viewed the Cold War between liberal democracy and communism as the final conflict between God and Satan, with divided Korea as its primary front line [184] Soon after its founding, the Unification movement began supporting anti-communist organizations, including the World League for Freedom and Democracy founded in 1966 in Taipei, Republic of China (Taiwan), by Chiang Kai-shek, [185] and the Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation, an international public diplomacy organization which also sponsored Radio Free Asia [186]\n\n\nKorean unification\nIn 1991, Moon met with Kim Il Sung, the North Korean president, to discuss ways to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula, as well as on international relations, tourism, and other topics [215] In 1992, Kim gave his first and only interview with the Western news media to Washington Times reporter Josette Sheeran, who later became executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme [216] In 1994, Moon was officially invited to Kim's funeral, in spite of the absence of diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea [217]\n\n\nOther political positions\nMoon was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea [222] The church member Jae-jung Lee had been once a unification minister of South Korea [223] Another, Ek Nath Dhakal, is a member of the Nepalese Constituent Assembly, [232] and the first Minister for Co-operatives and Poverty Alleviation Ministry of the Government of Nepal [233] In 2016, a study sponsored by the Unification Theological Seminary found that American members were divided in their choices in the 2016 United States presidential election, with the largest bloc supporting Senator Bernie Sanders [234]\n\n\nCriticism\nMoon's claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been rejected by both Jewish and Christian scholars [244] [245] Protestant commentators have criticized Moon's teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone [246] [247] In their influential book The Kingdom of the Cults (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K Zacharias disagreed with the Divine Principle on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, Moon's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus [248]\n\n\nCriticisms of Moon\nMoon's claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been rejected by both Jewish and Christian scholars [244] [245] Protestant commentators have criticized Moon's teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone [246] [247] In their influential book The Kingdom of the Cults (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K Zacharias disagreed with the Divine Principle on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, Moon's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus [248]\n\n\nTheological disputes with Christianity\nCentral to Unification teachings is the concept that the Fall of Man was caused by the literal mating of Eve and Satan in the Garden of Eden, which contaminated the whole human race with sin According to the religion, humanity can only be restored to God through a messiah who comes as a new Adam: a new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, and siring new children free from Satanic influence In the Unification Church, Jesus is this messiah, just as he is a messianic figure in more mainstream Christianity; [258] however, since Jesus was prematurely killed before he could start a new sinless family, Moon claims he himself was called upon by God to fulfill Jesus' unresolved mission [3]\n\n\nFall of Man and view of Jesus\nCentral to Unification teachings is the concept that the Fall of Man was caused by the literal mating of Eve and Satan in the Garden of Eden, which contaminated the whole human race with sin According to the religion, humanity can only be restored to God through a messiah who comes as a new Adam: a new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, and siring new children free from Satanic influence In the Unification Church, Jesus is this messiah, just as he is a messianic figure in more mainstream Christianity; [258] however, since Jesus was prematurely killed before he could start a new sinless family, Moon claims he himself was called upon by God to fulfill Jesus' unresolved mission [3]\n\n\nIndemnity\nIndemnity, in the context of Unification theology, is a part of the process by which human beings and the world are restored to God's ideal [265] [266] [267] [268] The concept of indemnity is explained at the start of the second half of the Divine Principle, \"Introduction to Restoration\":\n\n\nIdeal family\nA doctrine of Rev Moon's teachings and the Unification movement is that the messiah will part complete Jesus' work by marrying and raising the \"ideal\" and \"sinless\" family as an example for others to follow and so restore God's original plan for humanity [2]\nHowever, according to journalist Robert F Worth, since the death of Sun Myung Moon, \"his children have struggled to live up to their 'sinless' billing\" They \n\n\nSpending church funds in casinos\nIn Moon and Han's teachings, Las Vegas was described as a \"city of Satan,\" and they aimed to amass believers to transform that hell into heaven However, in 2022, reports from Shukan Bunshun and TBS News revealed that, according to transaction records compiled between 2008 and 2011 by MGM Resorts International, Hak Ja Han and 11 church executives lost approximately $6.52 million in Las Vegas casinos According to a former domestic helper of Hak Ja Han, the religious president's favorite casino game was the slot machine [279]\n\n\nInvestigation by the United States House of Representatives\nIn 1977, the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, of the United States House of Representatives, reported that the Unification Church was established by the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), Kim Chong Pil [281] The committee also reported that the KCIA had used the movement to gain political influence with the United States and some of its members had worked as volunteers in Congressional offices Together they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization which acted as a public diplomacy campaign for South Korea [10] The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Unification Church's campaign in support of Nixon [282]\n\n\nDefamation lawsuit against the Daily Mail\nIn 1978, the Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper, published an article with the headline: \"The Church That Breaks Up Families\" [289] [290] The article accused the Unification Church of brainwashing and separating families The British Unification Church's director Dennis Orme filed a libel suit against the Daily Mail and Associated Newspapers, its parent company, resulting in one of the longest civil actions in British legal history – lasting six months [289] [291] [292] Orme and the Unification Church lost the libel case, the appeal case, and were refused permission to take their case to the House of Lords [292]\n\n\nUnited States v. Sun Myung Moon\nIn 1982, Moon was imprisoned in the United States after being found guilty by a jury of willfully filing false Federal income tax returns and conspiracy The Unification Church of the United States members launched a public-relations campaign Booklets, letters and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 Christian leaders in the United States Many of them signed petitions protesting the government's case [139] The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A, the National Council of Churches, the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon [140]\n\n\nCrown of Peace event in Washington DC\nOn March 23, 2004, at a ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, in Washington, D.C., Moon crowned himself with what was called the \"Crown of Peace\" [301] [302] Lawmakers who attended included Senator Mark Dayton (D-Minn.), Representatives Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), as well as former Representative Walter Fauntroy (D-D.C.) Key organizers of the event included George Augustus Stallings Jr., a former Roman Catholic priest who had been married by Moon, and Michael Jenkins, the president of the Unification Church of the United States at that time [301] Rep Danny K Davis (D-Ill.) played an active role in the ceremony The New York Times, in 2008, suggested that the participation of federal elected officials in this event was a possible violation of the principle of separation of church and state in United States law [302]\n\n\nIn Japan (1970–2023)\nThe Unification church in Japan has faced several controversies:\n\n\nSupport for North Korea's development of nuclear weapons\nAccording to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reports in August and September 1994, Moon donated 450 billion yen to Kim Il Sung during his stay in North Korea from November 30, 1991, to December 7, 1992 Those same DIA reports explained an \"economic cooperation\" for the reconstruction of North Korea's economy was in place This included establishing a joint venture developing tourism at Kimkangsan, investing in the development of the Tumangang River, in addition to investing in the construction of the \"light industry\" base located in Wonsan [312] [313] Most of the money was said to have been donated to the Unification Church by Japanese believers [314] [315] According to the former chief executive of Pyeonghwa Motors, a Unification Church auto company, the money collected from Japanese devotees was first transferred to South Korea and money laundered, then transferred to Hong Kong and finally to North Korea He said he had a close relationship with Ju Kyu-chang, a senior member of the Workers' Party of Korea and its weapons development chief [316] [need quotation to verify]\n\n\nControversy in South Korea\nIn South Korea the Unification Church has been criticized for supporting the interests of Japan over those of South Korea South Korean media reported links between the UC and Japanese conservatives, referring to them as Chinil (친일) or Sin-chinil (신친일) Some South Korean media reported a connection between Yoon Suk-yeol's pro-Japanese foreign policy and the UC [319] [320]\n\n\nEsotericism\nThe Unification Church is sometimes said to be esoteric in that it keeps some of its doctrines secret from non-members, [321] [322] [323] a practice that is sometimes called \"heavenly deception\" [324] In 1979, critics D Tingle and R Fordyce commented: \"How different the openness of Christianity is to the attitude of Reverend Moon and his followers who are often reluctant to reveal to the public many of their basic doctrines.\" [325] Since the 1990s, many Unification texts that were formerly regarded as esoteric have been posted on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification's official websites [326]\n\n\n\"Crazy for God\"\nIn The Way of God's Will, a collection of sayings popular among church members, Moon is quoted as saying: \"We leaders should leave the tradition that we have become crazy for God.\" [256] In 1979 Unification Church critic Christopher Edwards titled a memoir about his experiences in the six months he spent as a church member: Crazy for God: The Nightmare of Cult Life [257]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn November 1995, German authorities blacklisted the founders of the Unification Church (Reverend Sun Myung Moon, and his wife, Hak Ja Han Moon) through the Schengen Information System and thus forbid entry to 12 European countries [327] The period of exclusion was extended several times [328] [329] After 12 years on October 24, 2006 German Federal Constitutional Court ruled, that previous court rulings and authorities' treatment of the Unification Church in the period from November 1995 violated Article 4 paragraph 1 (Freedom of faith and conscience is inviolable) and paragraph 2 (undisturbed practice is guaranteed) of the German Constitution and is repealed must reimburse the UC for the necessary expenses (articles 2 and 3 of the ruling) Also stated, that the authorities' defense was based on rumors and assumptions (article 15 of the ruling) and the previous ruling of the Higher Administrative Court was based on weighting religious matters, which is not permitted by state authorities (article 27 of the ruling) [330] Court by this decision rejects with immediate effect the rationale of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior for the 1995 immigration exclusion and not granting an entry visa [331] [332]\n\n\nGermany\nIn November 1995, German authorities blacklisted the founders of the

21-year-old woman, Claire Château, who was on the central street of Dijon distributing brochures, was pulled into a moving car shouting for help After a medical-psychological examination showed that Mrs Château enjoyed perfect mental health with no traces of alleged \"brainwashing\", 7 people, family members, and ADFI \"professional deprogrammers\" were accused by the Dijon Regional Criminal Investigation Department (Service Régional de Police Judiciaire de Dijon) of kidnapping under §341 of the French Penal Code to the Besançon Court of Justice [333] [334] The case contributed to the gradual abandonment of abductions and deprogramming attempts [335]\n\n\nRussia\nIn 2000 Russia excluded Patrick Francis Nolan from reentry to Russia, holding him captive at the airport overnight based on FSB material on countering non-traditional religions The visa was repeatedly canceled on reentry without an explanation, which separated him from his son, who stayed in Russia, for almost one year European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in 2009 in the case Nolan and K v Russia stated, that Russia failed to comply or violated Articles 38§1a, 9, 8, 5§1, 5§5 and Article 1 of Protocol No 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Convention) and decided that Russia should pay a sum of 7.810 € for damages [336]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn Thanksgiving 1979, the parents of 28 year-old Thomas Ward conspired with 31 other people to kidnap him (for the second time) and hold him captive for 35 days He suffered verbal and physical abuse in attempts to \"de-program\" him of his religious beliefs Attempts failed and 33 people heard the verdict on the crimes of conspiracy, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and grand larceny The 4th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on April 18, 1980, that federal civil rights laws protect against religious discrimination The judgment contradicted the (then common) \"parental immunity\" principle in such cases [338] [339] Thomas J Ward graduated in 1981 from the Unification Theological Seminary and in 2019 became its president [340]\n\n\nRelated organizations and groups\nMoon believed in a literal Kingdom of God on earth to be brought about by human effort, motivating his establishment of numerous groups, some that are not strictly religious in their purposes [341] [176] Moon was not directly involved with managing the day-to-day activities of the organizations that he indirectly oversaw, yet all of them attribute the inspiration behind their work to his leadership and teachings [15] [342] [343]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Unification Church\n\nIntroduction\nThe

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Unification_Church\" following this outline:\n\n\nPopular terminologies\nMoon did not originally intend to found a separate organization or denomination, [16] and did not give his group of followers its official name, Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (세계 기독교 통일 신령 협회; Segye Gidoggyo Tong-il Sinryeong Hyeobhoe), until 1954 [17] The informal name \"Unification Church\" (통일교; Tongilgyo) has been commonly used by members, the public, and the news media [18] By 2018, the term \"Unification Movement\" was also widely used [19]\n\n\nHistory\nOn February 25, 1920, Moon was born Mun Yong-myeong in Sangsa-ri (상사리; 上思里), Deogun-myon (덕언면), Jeongju-gun, North P'yŏng'an Province, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule His birthday was recorded as January 6 by the traditional lunar calendar (February 25, 1920, according to the Gregorian Calendar) [30] Around 1930, his family, who followed traditional Confucianist beliefs, converted to Christianity and joined a Presbyterian Church, where he later taught Sunday school [31]\n\n\nBackground and origins\nOn February 25, 1920, Moon was born Mun Yong-myeong in Sangsa-ri (상사리; 上思里), Deogun-myon (덕언면), Jeongju-gun, North P'yŏng'an Province, at a time when Korea was under Japanese rule His birthday was recorded as January 6 by the traditional lunar calendar (February 25, 1920, according to the Gregorian Calendar) [30] Around 1930, his family, who followed traditional Confucianist beliefs, converted to Christianity and joined a Presbyterian Church, where he later taught Sunday school [31]\n\n\nHoly Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (1954–1994)\nMoon founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC) in Seoul on May 1, 1954 It expanded rapidly in South Korea and, by the end of 1955, had 30 centers nationwide [17] The HSA-UWC expanded throughout the world, with most members living in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other nations in East Asia [37] [17] In the 1970s, American HSA-UWC members were noted for raising money for Unification Church projects [38]\n\n\nFamily Federation for World Peace and Unification (1994–present)\nOn May 1, 1994 (the 40th anniversary of the founding of the HSA-UWC), Moon declared that the era of the HSA-UWC had ended and inaugurated a new organization: the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU) would include HSA-UWC members and members of other religious organizations working toward common goals, especially on issues of sexual morality and reconciliation between people of different religions, nations, and races The FFWPU co-sponsored Blessing ceremonies in which thousands of couples from other churches and religions were given the marriage blessing previously given only to HSA-UWC members [62]\n\n\nMoon's death and divisions within the Unification Church\nOn August 15, 2012, Moon was reported to be gravely ill and was put on a respirator at the intensive care unit of St Mary's Hospital at The Catholic University of Korea in Seoul He was admitted on August 14, 2012, after suffering from pneumonia earlier in the month [78] He died there on September 3 [79]\n\n\nBeliefs\nMoon's book, The Divine Principle, was, he claimed, revealed to him over a period of nine years after he claimed Jesus appeared to him on Easter Sunday 1936 on the mountainside and asked him to continue the work that he could not finish while he was on earth, due to the \"tragedy\" of his crucifixion [84] It was first published as Wolli Wonbon (원리 원본; 原理原本, 'Original Text of the Divine Principle') in 1945 The earliest manuscript was lost in North Korea during the Korean War A second, expanded version, Wonli Hesol (원리 해설; 原理解說), or Explanation of the Divine Principle, was published in 1957 The Divine Principle   [ko] or Exposition of the Divine Principle (원리강론; 原理講論; Wolli Gangnon) is the main theological textbook of the movement It was co-written by Sun Myung Moon and early disciple Hyo Won'eu and first published in 1966 A translation entitled Divine Principle was published in English in 1973 [85] The Divine Principle lays out the core of Unification Church theology and is held by its believers to have the status of holy scripture Following the format of systematic theology, it includes God's purpose in creating human beings, the fall of man, and restoration – the process through history by which God is working to remove the ill effects of the fall and restore humanity back to the relationship and position that God originally intended [86] David Václavík and Dušan Lužný described the details of those three points as follows:\n\n\nTraditions\nThe Unification Church is well known for its Blessing tradition: a mass wedding ceremony (합동결혼식) and wedding vow renewal ceremony It is given to engaged or married couples According to the Church's belief in a serpent seed interpretation of original sin and the Fall of Man, Eve was sexually seduced by Satan (the serpent), and thus the human bloodline is sinful due to being directly descended from Satan [90] [91] Through the Blessing, members believe, the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and restored back into God's sinless lineage.\n\n\nBlessing ceremony\nThe Unification Church is well known for

members believe, the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and restored back into God's sinless lineage.\n\n\nHoly days\nHoly Days of the Unification Church: [104]\n\n\nScholarly studies\nIn the early 1960s, John Lofland lived with HSA-UWC missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of American members and studied their promotional and proselytization activities Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members—often family relationships Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled \"The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes\", and in a 1966 book by Prentice-Hall, Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nRelations with other religions\nUnificationism holds that the Jewish people as a whole were prepared by God to receive the Messiah in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, with John the Baptist tasked from birth with the mission to lead the Jewish people to Jesus, but failed in his mission According to the Divine Principle, the Jews went through a \"course of indemnity\" due to the failure of John the Baptist to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, in spite of publicly testifying to him at the Jordan River, whilst receiving the baptism [119]\n\n\nJudaism\nUnificationism holds that the Jewish people as a whole were prepared by God to receive the Messiah in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, with John the Baptist tasked from birth with the mission to lead the Jewish people to Jesus, but failed in his mission According to the Divine Principle, the Jews went through a \"course of indemnity\" due to the failure of John the Baptist to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, in spite of publicly testifying to him at the Jordan River, whilst receiving the baptism [119]\n\n\nChristianity\nProtestant commentators have criticized Unification Church teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone [128] In their influential book The Kingdom of the Cults (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K Zacharias disagreed with the Divine Principle on the issues of Christology, the virgin birth of Jesus, the movement's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, and a literal resurrection of Jesus as well as a literal Second Coming [129]\n\n\nIslam\nThe Divine Principle lists the Muslim world as one of the world's four major divisions (the others being East Asia, Hindu, and Christendom) [142] Unification movement support for Islamist anti-communists came to public attention in 1987 when church member Lee Shapiro was killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War while filming a documentary [143] [144] The resistance group they were traveling with reported that they had been ambushed by military forces of the Soviet Union or the Afghan government However, the details have been questioned, partly because of the poor reputation of the group's leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar [145] [146]\n\n\nInterfaith activities\nIn 2009 the FFWPU held an interfaith event in the Congress of the Republic of Peru [159] Former president of the Congress Marcial Ayaipoma [160] and other notable politicians were called \"Ambassadors for Peace\" of the Unification Church [161] [162] [163] [164] In 2010, the church built a large interfaith temple in Seoul [165] Author Deepak Chopra was the keynote speaker at an interfaith event of the Unification Church co-hosted with the United Nations at the headquarters of the United Nations [166] In 2011, an interfaith event was held at the National Assembly of Thailand, the President of the National Assembly of Thailand attended the event [167]\n\n\nScience\nThe Divine Principle calls for the unification of science and religion: \"Religion and science, each in their own spheres, have been the methods of searching for truth in order to conquer ignorance and attain knowledge Eventually, the way of religion and the way of science should be integrated and their problems resolved in one united undertaking; the two aspects of truth, internal and external, should develop in full consonance.\"\n\n\nPolitical activism\nDefunct\n\n\nAnti-communism\nIn the 1940s, Moon cooperated with Communist Party members in support of the Korean independence movement against Imperial Japan After the Korean War (1950–1953), he became an outspoken anti-communist [157] Moon viewed the Cold War between liberal democracy and communism as the final conflict between God and Satan, with divided Korea as its primary front line [184] Soon after its founding, the Unification movement began supporting anti-communist organizations, including the World League for Freedom and Democracy founded in 1966 in Taipei, Republic of China (Taiwan), by Chiang Kai-shek, [185] and the Korean Culture and Freedom Foundation, an international public diplomacy organization which also sponsored Radio Free Asia [186]\n\n\nKorean unification\nIn 1991, Moon met with Kim Il Sung, the North Korean president, to discuss ways to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula, as well as on international relations, tourism, and other topics [215] In 1992, Kim gave his first and only interview with the Western news media to Washington Times reporter Josette Sheeran, who later became executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme [216] In 1994, Moon was officially invited to Kim's funeral, in spite of the absence of diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea [217]\n\n\nOther political positions\nMoon was a member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea [222] The church member Jae-jung Lee had been once a unification minister of South Korea [223] Another, Ek Nath Dhakal, is a member of the Nepalese Constituent Assembly, [232] and the first Minister for Co-operatives and Poverty Alleviation Ministry of the Government of Nepal [233] In 2016, a study sponsored by the Unification Theological Seminary found that American members were divided in their choices in the 2016 United States presidential election, with the largest bloc supporting Senator Bernie Sanders [234]\n\n\nCriticism\nMoon's claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been rejected by both Jewish and Christian scholars [244] [245] Protestant commentators have criticized Moon's teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone [246] [247] In their influential book The Kingdom of the Cults (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K Zacharias disagreed with the Divine Principle on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, Moon's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus [248]\n\n\nCriticisms of Moon\nMoon's claim to be the Messiah and the Second Coming of Christ has been rejected by both Jewish and Christian scholars [244] [245] Protestant commentators have criticized Moon's teachings as being contrary to the Protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone [246] [247] In their influential book The Kingdom of the Cults (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K Zacharias disagreed with the Divine Principle on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus, Moon's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity of the crucifixion of Jesus, a literal resurrection of Jesus, as well as a literal second coming of Jesus [248]\n\n\nTheological disputes with Christianity\nCentral to Unification teachings is the concept that the Fall of Man was caused by the literal mating of Eve and Satan in the Garden of Eden, which contaminated the whole human race with sin According to the religion, humanity can only be restored to God through a messiah who comes as a new Adam: a new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, and siring new children free from Satanic influence In the Unification Church, Jesus is this messiah, just as he is a messianic figure in more mainstream Christianity; [258] however, since Jesus was prematurely killed before he could start a new sinless family, Moon claims he himself was called upon by God to fulfill Jesus' unresolved mission [3]\n\n\nFall of Man and view of Jesus\nCentral to Unification teachings is the concept that the Fall of Man was caused by the literal mating of Eve and Satan in the Garden of Eden, which contaminated the whole human race with sin According to the religion, humanity can only be restored to God through a messiah who comes as a new Adam: a new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, and siring new children free from Satanic influence In the Unification Church, Jesus is this messiah, just as he is a messianic figure in more mainstream Christianity; [258] however, since Jesus was prematurely killed before he could start a new sinless family, Moon claims he himself was called upon by God to fulfill Jesus' unresolved mission [3]\n\n\nIndemnity\nIndemnity, in the context of Unification theology, is a part of the process by which human beings and the world are restored to God's ideal [265] [266] [267] [268] The concept of indemnity is explained at the start of the second half of the Divine Principle, \"Introduction to Restoration\":\n\n\nIdeal family\nA doctrine of Rev Moon's teachings and the Unification movement is that the messiah will part complete Jesus' work by marrying and raising the \"ideal\" and \"sinless\" family as an example for others to follow and so restore God's original plan for humanity [2]\nHowever, according to journalist Robert F Worth, since the death of Sun Myung Moon, \"his children have struggled to live up to their 'sinless' billing\" They \n\n\nSpending church funds in casinos\nIn Moon and Han's teachings, Las Vegas was described as a \"city of Satan,\" and they aimed to amass believers to transform that hell into heaven However, in 2022, reports from Shukan Bunshun and TBS News revealed that, according to transaction records compiled between 2008 and 2011 by MGM Resorts International, Hak Ja Han and 11 church executives lost approximately $6.52 million in Las Vegas casinos According to a former domestic helper of Hak Ja Han, the religious president's favorite casino game was the slot machine [279]\n\n\nInvestigation by the United States House of Representatives\nIn 1977, the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, of the United States House of Representatives, reported that the Unification Church was established by the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), Kim Chong Pil [281] The committee also reported that the KCIA had used the movement to gain political influence with the United States and some of its members had worked as volunteers in Congressional offices Together they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit organization which acted as a public diplomacy campaign for South Korea [10] The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Unification Church's campaign in support of Nixon [282]\n\n\nDefamation lawsuit against the Daily Mail\nIn 1978, the Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper, published an article with the headline: \"The Church That Breaks Up Families\" [289] [290] The article accused the Unification Church of brainwashing and separating families The British Unification Church's director Dennis Orme filed a libel suit against the Daily Mail and Associated Newspapers, its parent company, resulting in one of the longest civil actions in British legal history – lasting six months [289] [291] [292] Orme and the Unification Church lost the libel case, the appeal case, and were refused permission to take their case to the House of Lords [292]\n\n\nUnited States v. Sun Myung Moon\nIn 1982, Moon was imprisoned in the United States after being found guilty by a jury of willfully filing false Federal income tax returns and conspiracy The Unification Church of the United States members launched a public-relations campaign Booklets, letters and videotapes were mailed to approximately 300,000 Christian leaders in the United States Many of them signed petitions protesting the government's case [139] The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A, the National Council of Churches, the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference filed briefs in support of Moon [140]\n\n\nCrown of Peace event in Washington DC\nOn March 23, 2004, at a ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, in Washington, D.C., Moon crowned himself with what was called the \"Crown of Peace\" [301] [302] Lawmakers who attended included Senator Mark Dayton (D-Minn.), Representatives Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), as well as former Representative Walter Fauntroy (D-D.C.) Key organizers of the event included George Augustus Stallings Jr., a former Roman Catholic priest who had been married by Moon, and Michael Jenkins, the president of the Unification Church of the United States at that time [301] Rep Danny K Davis (D-Ill.) played an active role in the ceremony The New York Times, in 2008, suggested that the participation of federal elected officials in this event was a possible violation of the principle of separation of church and state in United States law [302]\n\n\nIn Japan (1970–2023)\nThe Unification church in Japan has faced several controversies:\n\n\nSupport for North Korea's development of nuclear weapons\nAccording to Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reports in August and September 1994, Moon donated 450 billion yen to Kim Il Sung during his stay in North Korea from November 30, 1991, to December 7, 1992 Those same DIA reports explained an \"economic cooperation\" for the reconstruction of North Korea's economy was in place This included establishing a joint venture developing tourism at Kimkangsan, investing in the development of the Tumangang River, in addition to investing in the construction of the \"light industry\" base located in Wonsan [312] [313] Most of the money was said to have been donated to the Unification Church by Japanese believers [314] [315] According to the former chief executive of Pyeonghwa Motors, a Unification Church auto company, the money collected from Japanese devotees was first transferred to South Korea and money laundered, then transferred to Hong Kong and finally to North Korea He said he had a close relationship with Ju Kyu-chang, a senior member of the Workers' Party of Korea and its weapons development chief [316] [need quotation to verify]\n\n\nControversy in South Korea\nIn South Korea the Unification Church has been criticized for supporting the interests of Japan over those of South Korea South Korean media reported links between the UC and Japanese conservatives, referring to them as Chinil (친일) or Sin-chinil (신친일) Some South Korean media reported a connection between Yoon Suk-yeol's pro-Japanese foreign policy and the UC [319] [320]\n\n\nEsotericism\nThe Unification Church is sometimes said to be esoteric in that it keeps some of its doctrines secret from non-members, [321] [322] [323] a practice that is sometimes called \"heavenly deception\" [324] In 1979, critics D Tingle and R Fordyce commented: \"How different the openness of Christianity is to the attitude of Reverend Moon and his followers who are often reluctant to reveal to the public many of their basic doctrines.\" [325] Since the 1990s, many Unification texts that were formerly regarded as esoteric have been posted on the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification's official websites [326]\n\n\n\"Crazy for God\"\nIn The Way of God's Will, a collection of sayings popular among church members, Moon is quoted as saying: \"We leaders should leave the tradition that we have become crazy for God.\" [256] In 1979 Unification Church critic Christopher Edwards titled a memoir about his experiences in the six months he spent as a church member: Crazy for God: The Nightmare of Cult Life [257]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn November 1995, German authorities blacklisted the founders of the Unification Church (Reverend Sun Myung Moon, and his wife, Hak Ja Han Moon) through the Schengen Information System and thus forbid entry to 12 European countries [327] The period of exclusion was extended several times [328] [329] After 12 years on October 24, 2006 German Federal Constitutional Court ruled, that previous court rulings and authorities' treatment of the Unification Church in the period from November 1995 violated Article 4 paragraph 1 (Freedom of faith and conscience is inviolable) and paragraph 2 (undisturbed practice is guaranteed) of the German Constitution and is repealed must reimburse the UC for the necessary expenses (articles 2 and 3 of the ruling) Also stated, that the authorities' defense was based on rumors and assumptions (article 15 of the ruling) and the previous ruling of the Higher Administrative Court was based on weighting religious matters, which is not permitted by state authorities (article 27 of the ruling) [330] Court by this decision rejects with immediate effect the rationale of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior for the 1995 immigration exclusion and not granting an entry visa [331] [332]\n\n\nGermany\nIn November 1995, German authorities blacklisted the founders of the Unification Church (Reverend Sun Myung Moon, and his wife, Hak Ja Han Moon) through the Schengen Information System and thus forbid entry to 12 European countries [327] The period of exclusion was extended several times [328] [329] After 12 years on October 24, 2006 German Federal Constitutional Court ruled, that previous court rulings and authorities' treatment of the Unification Church in the period from November 1995 violated Article 4 paragraph 1 (Freedom of faith and conscience is inviolable) and paragraph 2 (undisturbed practice is guaranteed) of the German Constitution and is repealed must reimburse the UC for the necessary expenses (articles 2 and 3 of the ruling) Also stated, that the authorities' defense was based on rumors and assumptions (article 15 of the ruling) and the previous ruling of the Higher Administrative Court was based on weighting religious matters, which is not permitted by state authorities (article 27 of the ruling) [330] Court by this decision rejects with immediate effect the rationale of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior for the 1995 immigration exclusion and not granting an entry visa [331] [332]\n\n\nFrance\nIn March 1982, a 21-year-old woman, Claire Château, who was on the central street of Dijon distributing brochures, was pulled into a moving car shouting for help After a medical-psychological examination showed that Mrs Château enjoyed perfect mental health with no traces of alleged \"brainwashing\", 7 people, family members, and ADFI \"professional deprogrammers\" were accused by the Dijon Regional Criminal Investigation Department (Service Régional de Police Judiciaire de Dijon) of kidnapping under §341 of the French Penal Code to the Besançon Court of Justice [333] [334] The case contributed to the gradual abandonment of abductions and deprogramming attempts [335]\n\n\nRussia\nIn 2000 Russia excluded Patrick Francis Nolan from reentry to Russia, holding him captive at the airport overnight based on FSB material on countering non-traditional religions The visa was repeatedly canceled on reentry without an explanation, which separated him from his son, who stayed in Russia, for almost one year European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in 2009 in the case Nolan and K v Russia stated, that Russia failed to comply or violated Articles 38§1a, 9, 8, 5§1, 5§5 and Article 1 of Protocol No 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Convention) and decided that Russia should pay a sum of 7.810 € for damages [336]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn Thanksgiving 1979, the parents of 28 year-old Thomas Ward conspired with 31 other people to kidnap him (for the second time) and hold him captive for 35 days He suffered verbal and physical abuse in attempts to \"de-program\" him of his religious beliefs Attempts failed and 33 people heard the verdict on the crimes of conspiracy, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and grand larceny The 4th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on April 18, 1980, that federal civil rights laws protect against religious discrimination The judgment contradicted the (then common) \"parental immunity\" principle in such cases [338] [339] Thomas J Ward graduated in 1981 from the Unification Theological Seminary and in 2019 became its president [340]\n\n\nRelated organizations and groups\nMoon believed in a literal Kingdom of God on earth to be brought about by human effort, motivating his establishment of numerous groups, some that are not strictly religious in their purposes [341] [176] Moon was not directly involved with managing the day-to-day activities of the organizations that he indirectly oversaw, yet all of them attribute the inspiration behind their work to his leadership and teachings [15] [342] [343]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party has announced its intent to contest in the 2026 elections and has already begun its preparations for the same.\n\n**History**\n\nTamilaga Vettri Kazhagam was founded by Vijay on 2 February 2024, after he announced the launch of his political party. The party is a culmination of Vijay's years-long involvement in philanthropic activities through his fan club, Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, which was launched on 26 June 2009. The fan club organization has been involved in various social and charitable activities, including supporting the AIADMK-led Alliance in the 2011 legislative assembly elections.\n\nIn October 2021, the fan club organization contested the local body elections in Tamil Nadu and secured victory in 115 out of the 169 seats they contested. This marked a significant milestone for the organization and laid the groundwork for the eventual launch of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam as a full-fledged political party.\n\n**Philosophy and Ideology**\n\nTamilaga Vettri Kazhagam has adopted left-wing leaning political ideologies, including Ambedkarism, Marxism, and Periyarism. The party has stated its intention to oppose the current status quo ruling parties, the DMK in Tamil Nadu and the BJP at the national level. This marked a significant departure from the right-wing politics that has dominated Indian politics for decades.\n\nThe party's ideology will be revealed in detail at its first political conference, TVK Maanadu, on 27 October 2024. The conference is expected to attract significant attention and will be a major milestone in the party's journey towards becoming a major player in Indian politics.\n\n**Party Leader**\n\nVijay is the founder and first president of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam. Vijay has been a prominent figure in the Tamil film industry for over two decades and has built a massive following among fans. As the president of the party, Vijay is expected to play a key role in shaping the party's ideology and direction.\n\n**2024–present**\n\nIn September 2024, it was reported that Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam would adopt left-wing leaning political ideologies, including Ambedkarism, Marxism, and Periyarism. The party has stated its intention to oppose the current status quo ruling parties, the DMK in Tamil Nadu and the BJP at the national level.\n\nIn July 2024, Vijay called for a ban on the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), as it was biased against rural students. The party has also urged the departments of education and sanitation to be moved back to the state list from the concurrent list.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nTamilaga Vettri Kazhagam has been involved in several controversies since its inception. In June 2024, the party was criticized for its decision to adopt left-wing leaning political ideologies, which was seen as a departure from the right-wing politics that has dominated Indian politics for decades.\n\nThe party has also been criticized for its decision to oppose the current status quo ruling parties, the DMK in Tamil Nadu and the BJP at the national level. Some have questioned the party's ability to mount a successful challenge to the established parties.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Vijay Makkal Iyakkam\n* AIADMK\n* DMK\n* BJP\n* Ambedkarism\n* Marxism\n* Periyarism\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tamilaga_Vettri_Kazhagam\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nOn 26 June 2009, Vijay launched his fan club, Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, in Pudukkottai to carry out philanthropic activities [10] [11] The organization supported the AIADMK-led Alliance in the 2011 legislative assembly elections The fan club organization contested the local body elections in Tamil Nadu in October 2021, securing victory in 115 out of the 169 seats they contested [12] [13] On 2 February 2024, Vijay announced the launch of his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, and stated its intent to enter the 2026 elections [14] [15] Vijay called the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 as \"unacceptable\" as it would disrupt the social and religious harmony of the nation [16] Bussy Anand is currently serving as the general secretary of Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam [17] [1] In July, 2024, Vijay called for ban on National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), as its biased against rural students and urged the departments of education and sanitation to be moved back to the state list from the concurrent list [18] [19]\n\n\n(2024–present)\nIn 4 September, 2024, It was reported TVK will adopt left-wing leaning political ideologies, [20] including Ambedkarism, Marxism, and Periyarism, and will not align with right-wing positions or idealogies The party will be opposing the current status quo ruling parties, DMK in Tamil Nadu and BJP [21] [22] It was announced that the party's ideology will be revealed in detail at TVK's first political conference, TVK Maanadu, on October 27, 2024 [23] [24]\n\n\nParty leader\nFounder and First President is Vijay.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the league and its teams.\n\n# Summary\n\nAt the start of this season, as was the case at the end of the previous season, there was limited or no attendance at matches besides each team's staff and personnel. On 23 November 2020, it was announced that some fans would be allowed to return to stadiums in low-risk areas at the end of the second national lockdown on 2 December 2020. The announcement of a third national lockdown on 4 January 2021, though, signalled a return to matches being played behind closed doors.\n\n# Impact of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the 2020–21 Premier League season. The pandemic led to a delay in the start of the season, with the league beginning on 12 September 2020, just seven weeks after the conclusion of the 2019–20 season. The pandemic also led to a change in the format of the season, with the league introducing a mid-season break in February, which was later scrapped due to fixture congestion.\n\n# Season summary\n\nThe 2020–21 season began on Saturday 12 September, just seven weeks after the conclusion of the 2019–20 season. Liverpool were the defending champions, having won their nineteenth league title the previous season, their first in the Premier League era. As originally planned, the 2020–21 season was to be the second Premier League season with a mid-season break in February, whereby five games of a normal round of ten would be played on one weekend and the remaining five the following weekend. However, due to the late start of the league and fixture congestion, the winter break was scrapped. It is also the second Premier League season to use VAR (Video Assistant Referee).\n\nThe top of the table was tight for the first months of the season, with Arsenal, Leicester City, Everton, Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur all having occupied first position by late November. The top six were separated by only five points at that stage. Liverpool overtook Tottenham again in mid-December, following a meeting between the two clubs at Anfield which resulted in a 2–1 win to Liverpool. By Christmas, Liverpool had opened up a five-point gap following a 7–0 away win against Crystal Palace.\n\n# Liverpool's title defence collapses\n\nIn the new year, Liverpool suffered from a significant slump in form. They suffered their first home defeat in 69 games with a 1–0 defeat to Burnley, which began a run of six consecutive losses at Anfield, following losses to Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester City, Everton, Chelsea and Fulham, dropping to eighth place by early March. Manchester United took the lead at the top of the table in mid-January with a 1–0 away win against Burnley, but they were in turn replaced by Manchester City at the end of the month as a 5–0 Manchester City win over West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 2–1 home defeat for Manchester United against Sheffield United.\n\n# Manchester City become the champions\n\nThis was to prove the final change of team at the top, as Manchester City went on a 15-match winning streak which saw them 15 points clear of second-place Manchester United after a 4–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 March. They went on to secure the title on 12 May 2021 with three matches to spare, following a home defeat for Manchester United against Leicester. It was the club's fifth Premier League title and seventh English league title overall, as well as their third title in the past four seasons.\n\n# UEFA Champions League qualification\n\nThe remaining two slots for Champions League qualification were taken by Liverpool and Chelsea. Although Liverpool were 8th with ten games remaining, a run of eight wins from their final ten games, including a 95th-minute winner scored by goalkeeper Alisson against West Bromwich Albion, saw them recover their position to finish 3rd and qualify for a fifth straight season. Chelsea endured a difficult start to the season under Frank Lampard, who was sacked in January with the club in 9th position and replaced by Thomas Tuchel. The club's form improved under Tuchel to secure a second consecutive finish in 4th place, despite a final day defeat to Aston Villa. They won in that season's Champions League final the next week, in the competition's third all-English final against champions Manchester City.\n\n# UEFA Europa League qualification\n\nLeicester enjoyed a successful season, spending more time in the top four places than any other club. However, three defeats in their final four games, including a home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on the final day, saw them narrowly finish in 5th for a second consecutive season. Having narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, West Ham United surprised many by finishing 6th, their highest finish since 1998–99. Both these clubs earned qualification to the Europa League for the following season.\n\n# Relegation\n\nOn 17 April 2021, Sheffield United were confirmed to be the first team to be relegated to the Championship following a 1–0 defeat away to Wolverhampton Wanderers with six games remaining, ending their two-year top flight tenure. On 9 May 2021, West Bromwich Albion became the second team to be relegated following a 3–1 defeat away to Arsenal, with three games remaining, immediately returning to the Championship after a season's presence in the top flight. On 10 May 2021, Fulham were the third and final team to be relegated following a 2–0 defeat at home against Burnley with three games remaining, also immediately returning to the Championship after a season's presence in the top flight. This also marked the first time in the Premier League era that all three teams have been relegated with more than two games to spare, all three teams didn't reach the 30 point mark in the season.\n\n# Teams\n\nTwenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Leeds United, West Bromwich Albion and Fulham, after respective top flight absences of sixteen, two and one year(s). They replaced Bournemouth, Watford (both teams relegated to the Championship after five years in the top flight), and Norwich City (relegated after a year back in the top flight).\n\n# Stadiums and

September, just seven weeks after the conclusion of the 2019–20 season [12] Liverpool were the defending champions, having won their nineteenth league title the previous season, their first in the Premier League era [2] As originally planned, the 2020–21 season was to be the second Premier League season with a mid-season break in February, whereby five games of a normal round of ten would be played on one weekend and the remaining five the following weekend [13] However, due to the late start of the league and fixture congestion, the winter break was scrapped [14] It is also the second Premier League season to use VAR (Video Assistant Referee) [15]\n\n\nThe race for first place\nThe top of the table was tight for the first months of the season, with Arsenal, Leicester City, Everton,

band formed expressly for a television show of the same name With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet the standards of producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider [12] Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including \"I Wanna Be Free\" and \"Daydream Believer\" [12] The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates In Peter Tork's commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance line-up been based solely on playing ability, it ought to have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums) Like Peter Tork, Jones, despite playing mostly tambourine or maracas, was a multi-instrumentalist and would fill in for Tork on bass when he played keyboards and vice versa and for Dolenz on drums when the Monkees performed live concerts [citation needed]\n\n\nPost-Monkees career (1970–2012)\nBell Records, then having a string of hits with The Partridge Family, signed Jones to a somewhat inflexible solo record contract in 1971 [13] Jones was not allowed to choose his songs or producer, resulting in several lacklustre and aimless records [13] His second solo album, Davy Jones (1971) was notable for the song \"Rainy Jane\", which reached No 52 in the Billboard charts To promote the album, Jones performed \"Girl\" on an episode of The Brady Bunch entitled \"Getting Davy Jones\" [13] Although the single sold poorly, the popularity of Jones' appearance on the show resulted in \"Girl\" becoming his best-remembered solo hit, even though it was not included in the album The final single, \"I'll Believe In You\"/\"Road to Love\", was poorly received [13]\n\n\nDolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart (1976)\nThanks in part to reruns

(1977–1999)\nDespite his initial high-profile after the Monkees disbanded, Jones struggled to establish himself as a solo music artist Glenn A Baker, author of Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees, commented in 1986 that \"for an artist as versatile and confident as (Davy) Jones, the relative failure of his post-Monkees activities is puzzling For all his cocky predictions to the press about his future plans, Davy fell into a directionless heap when left to his own devices.\" [13]\n\n\nLater career (2000–2012)\nIn 2001, Jones released Just Me, an album of his own songs, some written for the album and others originally on Monkees releases [19] In the early 2000s he was performing in the Flower Power Concert Series during Epcot's Flower and Garden Festival, a yearly gig he would

Berkshire for renowned trainer Toby Balding.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJones was married three times and had four children In December 1967, he married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had been living Their relationship had been kept out of the public eye until after the birth of their first child in October 1968 It caused a considerable backlash for Jones from his fans when it was finally made public Jones later stated in Tiger Beat magazine, \"I kept my marriage a secret because I believe stars should be allowed a private life.\" [13] Jones and Haines had two daughters, Talia Elizabeth Jones (2 October 1968) and Sarah Lee Jones (3 July 1971) The marriage ended in 1975 [32]\n\n\nDeath\nOn the morning of 29 February 2012, Jones went to tend his 14 horses at a farm in Indiantown, Florida After

and his acquisition of Harrods He employed accountants and solicitors, private detectives and freelance journalists in an operation, said to cost many millions of pounds, that was beyond the scope of any newspaper inquiry [63] Illicit bugging devices were used and some of the money went in bribes to officials to unearth incriminating documents in Egypt, Haiti, Dubai, Brunei, France and Switzerland, allegedly proving fraudulent dealings by Al-Fayed and showing his humble origins and limited net worth [63]\n\n\nOwnership of Harrods\nHarrods had entered a steady decline under Hugh Fraser, yet still accounted for half of the House of Fraser group's profits Determined to restore Harrods' fortunes, Al-Fayed hired Brian Walsh as manager of House of Fraser [67] Walsh created divisions in the company, and more than 200 buyers resigned in the next two years Following arguments with Al-Fayed, Walsh was fired in October 1987 To calm staff, Al-Fayed distributed envelopes containing £2,000 in cash [68] Following Walsh's departure, Al-Fayed moved his offices onto the fifth floor of Harrods, and took a more hands-on role as chairman of the store [69] Walsh was replaced by Michael Ellis-Jones, who was fired after eight weeks [70]\n\n\nEmployee relations\nAl-Fayed was concerned by the loyalty of his staff, and employed two young Greek women as spies, to report on

and forced to go to an industrial tribunal [80] Al-Fayed also listened to his employees, and secretly recorded conversations about their sex lives [71]\n\n\nRoyal warrants\nIn August 2010, in a letter to the Daily Telegraph, Al-Fayed revealed that he had burnt Harrods royal warrants, after taking them down in 2000 Harrods had held the Royal warrants since 1910 Describing the warrants as a \"curse\", Al-Fayed claimed that business had tripled since their removal The Duke of Edinburgh removed his warrant in January 2000, [84] and the other warrants were removed from Harrods by Al-Fayed in December, pending their five-yearly review The Duke of Edinburgh had been banned from Harrods by Al-Fayed [85] Film of the burning of the warrants in 2009 was shown in the final scene of Unlawful Killing, a film funded by Al-Fayed and directed by Keith Allen [84]\n\n\nSale of Harrods\nAfter denials that it was for sale, Harrods was sold to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of the emirate of Qatar in May 2010 [86] A spokesman for Al-Fayed said \"in reaching the decision to retire, (Al-Fayed) wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would

for £2.5 million in May 1998 and it became the new premises for the Beth Marie Centre for Traumatised Children, which had previously been based in Sevenoaks The school reopened as The New School at West Heath in September 1998 [94] [95] In 2011 Mohamed Al-Fayed's daughter Camilla, who had worked as an ambassador for the charity for eight years, [96] opened the newly refurbished Zoe's Place baby hospice in West Derby, Liverpool [97]\n\n\nFulham F.C.\nAl-Fayed bought west London professional football club Fulham F.C for £6.25 million in 1997 [98] The purchase was made via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group [98] His long-term aim was that Fulham would become a Premier League side within five years In the 2000–01 season, Fulham won the First Division under manager Jean Tigana, winning 101 points and scoring 90 goals, and were promoted to the Premier League This meant that Al-Fayed had achieved his Premier League aim a year ahead of schedule [99] By 2002, Fulham were competing in European football, winning the Intertoto Cup and participating in the UEFA Cup Fulham reached the 2010 UEFA Europa League final, which they lost to Atletico Madrid, [99] and continued to play in the Premier League throughout Al-Fayed's tenure as owner, which ended in 2013 [100]\n\n\nBusiness interests\nAl-Fayed's business interests included:\n\n\nMedia interests\nIn 1996 Al-Fayed established

Egyptian citizen, entered Haiti on a Kuwaiti passport, and left Haiti with a Haitian diplomatic passport with which he entered the United Kingdom in 1964 In 1970 Al-Fayed informed Mahdi Al Tajir that his and his brothers Haitian diplomatic passports had expired, and their Egyptian passports made it difficult for them to obtain visas in many countries [159] Tajir secured Emirati passports for Al-Fayed, but not Emirati nationality [159] On the passport documents Al-Fayed had his date of birth changed from 1929 to 1933, making himself four years younger [159] His two brothers reduced their

Harrods\", a 1995 profile of Al-Fayed for Vanity Fair, Maureen Orth described how, according to former employees, \"Fayed regularly walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office Those who rebuffed him would often be subjected to crude, humiliating comments about their appearance or dress.. A dozen ex-employees I spoke with said that Fayed would chase secretaries around the office and sometimes try to stuff money down women's blouses\" [17] Al-Fayed sued Vanity Fair, resulting in a settlement with no damages paid, but requiring Vanity Fair to place all evidence in locked storage Vanity Fair chose to settle in part out of sympathy for Princess Diana's fatal crash [183]\n\n\nSexual misconduct scandal\nIn September 2024, BBC News reported that more than 20 women who had worked at Harrods have alleged that Al-Fayed sexually assaulted them; five of these women accused him of raping them [188] [189] Former manager of the women's club Fulham L.F.C., Gaute Haugenes said in September 2024 that to protect players from Al-Fayed they were not allowed to be left alone with him He also said that members of staff were aware that he \"liked young, blonde girls\" [190] [191]  A documentary, Al-Fayed: Predator at Harrods was broadcast on BBC Two which featured interviews with the women and explored evidence of the failure by Harrods to properly investigate the claims and the potential \"cover-up\" of abuse allegations [188]\nOn 21 September 2024, Dean Armstrong KC, a barrister representing alleged victims, said his team had 37 clients, but that he had been contacted by 150 individuals with claims about Al-Fayed [192] [193] In September 2024, it has been reported that Kristina Svensson, who worked at Ritz hotel, will be the first victim to file a complaint against Mohamed Al Fayed in France, while previously the focus was on London [194]\nOn 26 September 2024, the Metropolitan Police said they would be exploring to see if anyone else should be pursued for criminal offences following the allegations made against Al-Fayed On the same day, Harrods’s managing director, Michael Ward, said Al Fayed \"presided over a toxic culture of secrecy, intimidation, fear of repercussion and sexual misconduct\" [195]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in June 1971 in Brighton, England, Volanthen's interest in caving began at a young age, and he has since become one of the most respected and accomplished cave divers in the world.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nVolanthen grew up in Brighton, England, and attended Longhill High School in Rottingdean. He later studied electronics at De Montfort University in Leicester, where he developed a strong interest in engineering and design. Volanthen's surname is an anglicized spelling of the Swiss surname \"Vonlanthen,\" and his paternal grandfather was Swiss.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Volanthen began working as an engineer, but he soon realized that his true passion lay in caving and underwater exploration. He began cave diving through a social club at college and quickly became hooked on the sport. Volanthen's interest in caving was further fueled by his experiences as a scout, where he learned valuable skills in navigation, teamwork, and problem-solving.\n\n**Caving and Rescues**\n\nVolanthen's interest in caving and underwater exploration led him to develop a unique set of skills and expertise. He began cave diving with a partner, Richard Stanton, and together they have conducted numerous rescue attempts and exploratory dives in some of the world's most challenging underwater environments. Volanthen's experience and expertise have earned him a reputation as one of the most skilled and respected cave divers in the world.\n\nOne of Volanthen's earliest notable rescue attempts was in 2010, when he was part of a team that attempted to rescue Eric Establie from the Dragonnière Gaud Cave in France. Although the rescue attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, Volanthen's bravery and expertise were recognized, and he was awarded the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal for his efforts.\n\nIn 2011, Volanthen assisted in the recovery of the body of Polish cave diver Artur Kozłowski from a cave in Kiltartan, Ireland. The recovery operation was complex and challenging, but Volanthen's expertise and experience played a crucial role in the successful retrieval of the body.\n\n**Records**\n\nVolanthen and Stanton have set several records in cave diving, including the greatest depth achieved in a British cave. In 2004, they dived 76 meters (249 feet) at Wookey Hole in Somerset, a record that still stands today. In 2010, Volanthen, Stanton, Jason Mallinson, and René Houben set a world record for the longest cave penetration dive, reaching 8,800 meters (28,900 feet) in the Pozo Azul cave system in Spain.\n\nVolanthen's expertise and experience in cave diving have also led to the development of new equipment and techniques. He designs and constructs his own diving equipment, including mapping devices that collect information while diving. Volanthen also modifies his own rebreathers to increase their compactness and efficiency, a testament to his innovative approach to cave diving.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nVolanthen's expertise in engineering and design has led to the development of new equipment and techniques in cave diving. He designs and constructs his own diving equipment, including mapping devices that collect information while diving. Volanthen's mapping device is a state-of-the-art piece of equipment that has revolutionized the way cave divers navigate and explore underwater environments.\n\nVolanthen also modifies his own rebreathers to increase their compactness and efficiency. This expertise has earned him a reputation as a \"technical guru\" in the cave diving community. Volanthen's innovative approach to equipment design and modification has helped to push the boundaries of what is possible in cave diving.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nVolanthen's bravery and expertise have been recognized with several awards and honors. In 2012, he was awarded the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal for his rescue attempt of a diver in a French cave and for the discovery of the diver's body. Volanthen's commitment to cave diving and exploration has also earned him a reputation as one of the most respected and accomplished cave divers in the world.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nOutside of cave diving, Volanthen is a volunteer scout leader with the Somerset Scouts, taking children on cave excursions and teaching them valuable skills in navigation, teamwork, and problem-solving. He is also a keen runner and has completed several marathons and ultramarathons. Volanthen was formerly married to Annabelle Richards, and he continues to be involved in various charitable and community activities.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Cave diving\n* Underwater exploration\n* Diving equipment\n* Cave rescue\n* Exploration", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Volanthen\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nVolanthen was born in June 1971, [2] and grew up in Brighton, England [1] Volanthen's surname is an anglicised spelling of the Swiss surname \"Vonlanthen\" — his paternal grandfather was Swiss [3] He attended Longhill High School [4] in Rottingdean, and later De Montfort University in Leicester where he studied electronics [5]\n\n\nCaving and rescues\nVolanthen's interest in caving began when he was a scout [6] He began cave diving through a social club when he attended college [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly interest\nVolanthen's interest in caving began when he was a scout [6] He began cave diving through a social club when he attended college [citation needed]\n\n\nRescues\nVolanthen frequently cave dives and conducts rescues with a partner, Richard Stanton.\nHe was part of a team that attempted a cave rescue of Eric Establie in 2010, in the Dragonnière Gaud Cave near Labastide-de-Virac in the Ardèche region of France, which was ultimately unsuccessful [7] [8] In 2011, Volanthen assisted in the recovery of the body of Polish cave diver Artur Kozłowski from a cave in Kiltartan, Ireland [9] Norwegian authorities asked him to assist in recovering the bodies of two Finnish divers from Jordbrugrotta in 2014, but after diving down to the site he and his colleagues assessed the operation to be too risky [10] The bodies were subsequently recovered by Finnish and Norwegian divers.\n\n\nRecords\nIn 2004, Volanthen and Stanton set a record for the greatest depth achieved in a British cave, diving 76 m (249 ft) at Wookey Hole in Somerset [15] In 2010, Volanthen, Stanton, Jason Mallinson, and René Houben set a world record for the longest cave penetration dive, reaching 8,800 m (28,900 ft) in the Pozo Azul cave system in the Rudrón Valley in Spain [16]\n\n\nEquipment\nVolanthen designs and constructs some of his own diving equipment, and has been called a \"technical guru.\" [17] He designed a mapping device that collects information while diving [18]\nHe also designs and modifies his own rebreathers to increase their compactness and efficiency [17]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nVolanthen was awarded the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal in 2012 for a rescue attempt of a diver in a French cave, and for the discovery of the diver's body [19]\n\n\nBooks\nAs a hobby, Volanthen runs marathons and ultramarathons [1] He is also a volunteer scout leader with the Somerset Scouts, taking children on cave excursions [25] He was formerly married to Annabelle Richards [5]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAs a hobby, Volanthen runs marathons and ultramarathons [1] He is also a volunteer scout leader with the Somerset Scouts, taking children on cave excursions [25] He was formerly married to Annabelle Richards [5]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
