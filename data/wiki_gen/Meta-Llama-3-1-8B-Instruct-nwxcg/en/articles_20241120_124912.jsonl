driving him to Downtown Toronto to debut at the recently-opened Yuk Yuk's comedy club operating one-night-a-week out of community center The 519's basement on Church Street [16] [18] For the

ambitions.\n\n\n1983–1994: Move to Hollywood\nIn early 1983, Carrey decided to move to Hollywood where he began regularly performing at The Comedy Store Getting on The Tonight Show became his immediate career goal, and, by spring 1983, he appeared to have achieved it after getting booked for a stand-up set on the highly-rated late night show [34] However, a lukewarm club set at The Improv got him unbooked [34] Though struggling to replicate his success in Los Angeles, Carrey continued being a big hit in his hometown Toronto where he returned during late April 1983 to perform at the short-lived B.B Magoon's theatrical venue on Bloor Street on three consecutive nights While in town, CTV's flagship newsmagazine program W5 did a feature on Carrey that aired nationally in Canada Back in L.A., within months, he landed the main role on The Duck Factory, a sitcom being developed for NBC, and, in late November 1983, still got to debut his impressionist act on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson via a promotional appearance for the sitcom about to start airing nationally in the United States on the same network [34] In the meantime, he was cast for a supporting role in the Warner Bros comedy production Finders Keepers, shot in the Canadian province of Alberta during late summer 1983 For his Tonight Show appearance that aired on American Thanksgiving, 21-year-old Carrey went through his most popular impressions—Elvis Presley, Leonid Brezhnev, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Michael Landon, James Dean, E.T the Extra-Terrestrial, Charles Nelson Reilly, characters from My Three Sons, and Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy—in rapid succession [35] After completing his set, though getting the OK gesture from Carson, the impressionist comic was notably not waved over by the host to join him on the couch—a usual indication that while sufficiently pleased, the powerful host was probably not ecstatic about the performance [36] The end of 1983 saw Carrey go back home to Toronto once more for a publicized New Years' Eve performance at the Royal York Hotel's Imperial Room.\n\n\n1994–1998: Rise to fame\nCarrey played the lead role in Ace

and paid him $7 million to appear in Dumb and Dumber, a nearly tenfold increase on his salary for Ace Ventura [45] [46] The Mask, released in July 1994, grossed $351 million worldwide, [47] [48] and Dumb and Dumber, released in December 1994, was another commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide [49] Carrey received his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor for his

he would be nominated for an Academy Award [58] He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama but did not receive an Academy Award nomination The Truman Show was a commercial success, grossing $264 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million [59] [60] A Film4 critic stated that the film \"allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy,\" adding that it was \"a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire.\" [61]\n\n\n2007–2018: Change in pace\nCarrey reunited with Joel Schumacher, director of Batman Forever, for The Number 23 (2007), a psychological

\"Jim_Carrey\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nCarrey was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, [2] to Kathleen (née Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, a musician and accountant [5] He was raised Catholic and has three older siblings, John, Patricia, and Rita [6] [7] His mother was of French, Irish, and Scottish descent, and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry; the family's original surname was Carré [8] [9] [10]\n\n\nCareer\nCarrey's first stand-up comedy experience took place in 1977 at the age of 15 with his father trying to help him put together a stage act, driving him to Downtown Toronto to debut at the recently-opened Yuk Yuk's comedy club operating one-night-a-week out of community center The 519's basement on Church Street [16] [18] For the performance, Carrey had his attire—a polyester leisure suit—chosen by his mother who reasoned \"that's how they dress on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast\" [19] [16] Pubescent Carrey's conventional impersonations bombed, proving ill-suited for a club with a raunchy comedic sensibility and giving him doubts about his potential as a professional entertainer [16] Decades later, recalling Carrey's stand-up debut, Yuk Yuk's owner Mark Breslin described it as \"bad Rich Little\" [16] His family's financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey's show business ambitions.\n\n\n1977–1983: Early impressionist work in Toronto\nCarrey's first stand-up comedy experience took place in 1977 at the age of 15 with his father trying to help him put together a stage act, driving him to Downtown Toronto to debut at the recently-opened Yuk Yuk's comedy club operating one-night-a-week out of community center The 519's basement on Church Street [16] [18] For the performance, Carrey had his attire—a polyester leisure suit—chosen by his mother who reasoned \"that's how they dress on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast\" [19] [16] Pubescent Carrey's conventional impersonations bombed, proving ill-suited for a club with a raunchy comedic sensibility and giving him doubts about his potential as a professional entertainer [16] Decades later, recalling Carrey's stand-up debut, Yuk Yuk's owner Mark Breslin described it as \"bad Rich Little\" [16] His family's financial struggles made it difficult for them to support Carrey's show business ambitions.\n\n\n1983–1994: Move to Hollywood\nIn early 1983, Carrey decided to move to Hollywood where he began regularly performing at The Comedy Store Getting on The Tonight Show became his immediate career goal, and, by spring 1983, he appeared to have achieved it after getting booked for a stand-up set on the highly-rated late night show [34] However, a lukewarm club set at The Improv got him unbooked [34] Though struggling to replicate his success in Los Angeles, Carrey continued being a big hit in his hometown Toronto where he returned during late April 1983 to perform at the short-lived B.B Magoon's theatrical venue on Bloor Street on three consecutive nights While in town, CTV's flagship newsmagazine program W5 did a feature on Carrey that aired nationally in Canada Back in L.A., within months, he landed the main role on The Duck Factory, a sitcom being developed for NBC, and, in late November 1983, still got to debut his impressionist act on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson via a promotional appearance for the sitcom about to start airing nationally in the United States on the same network [34] In the meantime, he was cast for a supporting role in the Warner Bros comedy production Finders Keepers, shot in the Canadian province of Alberta during late summer 1983 For his Tonight Show appearance that aired on American Thanksgiving, 21-year-old Carrey went through his most popular impressions—Elvis Presley, Leonid Brezhnev, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Michael Landon, James Dean, E.T the Extra-Terrestrial, Charles Nelson Reilly, characters from My Three Sons, and Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy—in rapid succession [35] After completing his set, though getting the OK gesture from Carson, the impressionist comic was notably not waved over by the host to join him on the couch—a usual indication that while sufficiently pleased, the powerful host was probably not ecstatic about the performance [36] The end of 1983 saw Carrey go back home to Toronto once more for a publicized New Years' Eve performance at the Royal York Hotel's Imperial Room.\n\n\n1994–1998: Rise to fame\nCarrey played the lead role in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective which was released in February 1994 and went on to gross $72 million in the United States and Canada [44] Following its success and before the release of his next film, The Mask, which was anticipated to be another hit, Morgan Creek Productions paid him $5 million to reprise his role as Ace Ventura and New Line Cinema offered him $7 million to make a sequel to The Mask and paid him $7 million to appear in Dumb and Dumber, a nearly tenfold increase on his salary for Ace Ventura [45] [46] The Mask, released in July 1994, grossed $351 million worldwide, [47] [48] and Dumb and Dumber, released in December 1994, was another commercial success, grossing over $270 million worldwide [49] Carrey received his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor for his work in The Mask and was voted second on Quigley's Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, behind Tom Hanks [50]\n\n\n1998–2007: Critical acclaim\nThe following year he decided to take a pay cut to play the seriocomic role of Truman Burbank in the satirical comedy-drama film The Truman Show (1998) [57] The film was highly praised and brought Carrey further international acclaim, leading many to believe he would be nominated for an Academy Award [58] He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama but did not receive an Academy Award nomination The Truman Show was a commercial success, grossing $264 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million [59] [60] A Film4 critic stated that the film \"allows Carrey to edge away from broad comedy,\" adding that it was \"a hilarious and breathtakingly conceived satire.\" [61]\n\n\n2007–2018: Change in pace\nCarrey reunited with Joel Schumacher, director of Batman Forever, for The Number 23 (2007), a psychological thriller co-starring Virginia Madsen and Danny Huston In the film, Carrey plays a man who becomes obsessed with the number 23, after finding a book about a man with the same obsession The film was panned by critics The following year Carrey provided his voice for Dr Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! (2008) Carrey voiced Horton the Elephant for the CGI-animated feature, which was a box office success, grossing over $290 million worldwide [74] Carrey returned to live-action comedy, starring opposite Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper in Yes Man (also 2008) Carrey played a man who signs up for a self-help program that teaches him to say yes to everything Despite reviews being mixed, Rene Rodriquez of The Miami Herald stated, \"Yes Man is fine as far as Jim Carrey comedies go, but it's even better as a love story that just happens to make you laugh.\" [75] The film earned $225 million at the box office worldwide [76]\n\n\n2019–present\nIn June 2018, Carrey was cast as Dr Robotnik, the main antagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series, in a film adaptation of the franchise The film was released in February 2020 to positive reviews [98] Carrey's portrayal of Robotnik was praised, with some considering it one of his best performances in years [99] [100] Carrey returned for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released in April 2022, [101] which grossed $72 million at the US box office in its opening weekend to give Carrey the best opening of his career to date [102]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCarrey suffers from depression and took Prozac to combat the symptoms for years He later said that he no longer takes medications of any kind and abstains from coffee, alcohol and drugs [118]\n\n\nRelationships\n Carrey dated singer Linda Ronstadt for eight months in 1983 [122] In 1987, on March 28, Carrey married former actress and Comedy Store waitress Melissa Womer Their daughter, Jane Erin Carrey, was born later that year, on September 6 [123] Carrey and Womer divorced in 1995 [124]\n\n\nWrongful death lawsuits\nCarrey's girlfriend Cathriona White married Mark Burton in 2013, in Las Vegas She had been dating Carrey on and off since 2012, and was still married but dating Carrey when she died in 2015 [136] On September 19, 2016, Burton filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey, claiming that he had used his \"immense wealth and celebrity status\" to illegally obtain and distribute prescription drugs involved in White's death Carrey released a statement the following day:\n\n\nVaccine skepticism\nIn 2009, Carrey wrote an article questioning the merits of vaccination for The Huffington Post [143] With former partner Jenny McCarthy, Carrey led a \"Green Our Vaccines\" march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of \"toxic substances\" from children's vaccines, out of a belief that children had received \"too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic\" [144] The rally was criticized by David Gorski, an American surgical oncologist on Science-Based Medicine blog, for being anti-vaccine and not \"pro-safe vaccine\", [145] and by Steven Parker on the WebMD website for being \"irresponsible\" [146]\n\n\nPolitical and spiritual views\nCarrey is an outspoken advocate of the \"law of attraction\" In an interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 17, 1997, [150] he revealed that as a struggling actor he would use visualization techniques to get work He also stated that he visualized a $10 million check given to him for \"acting services rendered\", placed the check in his pocket, and seven years later received a $10 million check for his role in Dumb and Dumber [151] Carrey practices Transcendental Meditation [152] [153] Carrey has also advocated socialism and has urged the Democratic Party to embrace the movement, saying \"We have to say yes to socialism, to the word and everything We have to stop apologizing\" [154]\n\n\nArtwork and NFTs\nIn 2017, Carrey revealed that he had been painting for the past six years In 2011, he exhibited the painting Nothing to See Here in an art show in Palm Springs at the Heather James Fine Art Gallery [164] In 2017, Carrey released a six-minute documentary entitled, I Needed Color, which showed him working in his studio [164] In April 2022, Carrey announced that he had minted his first art NFT via the NFT platform SuperRare The NFT is based on a painting entitled Sunshower, and is accompanied by original voiceover [165] Carrey has since distanced himself from the idea [citation needed]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSelected filmography\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nOther\n\n\nWritten works\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nForewords\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The book has received widespread critical acclaim for its thought-provoking and emotionally charged exploration of themes such as trauma, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. At its core, Luckiest Girl Alive is a novel that delves into the darker aspects of life, challenging readers to confront their own moralities and question the notion of what constitutes a \"perfect\" life.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nAt first glance, 28-year-old Ani FaNelli appears to have a perfect life. She works as an editor at a glamorous New York City women's magazine called The Women's Magazine and has a loving fiancé named Luke from a wealthy family. However, Ani also hides a secret – as a teenager, she underwent a series of horrifying and emotionally crippling events, including a school shooting, that have continued to impact her well into her adult years. During the course of the novel, it is revealed that Ani was gang raped when she was 14. She tried reaching out for help after the assault, but was subjected to cruel bullying and taunts by her peers, who did not believe her.\n\nAs the story progresses, Ani begins to question whether she is truly happy with who she has become, and if her current life is the one she wants and needs. The novel's narrative is a complex exploration of Ani's inner world, delving into her thoughts, emotions, and motivations as she navigates the challenges of her past and present.\n\n**Development**\n\nLuckiest Girl Alive is a deeply personal novel for Jessica Knoll, who drew upon her own experiences of being gang raped and bullied as a teenager. Knoll's writing is characterized by its raw honesty and vulnerability, as she confronts the trauma and pain that she suffered in her childhood. The novel is a testament to the power of writing as a therapeutic tool, as Knoll uses her story to process her own emotions and work through the scars of her past.\n\nKnoll's decision to write about her own experiences was not taken lightly. In an interview, she revealed that she initially kept her past a secret, even as she wrote about the experiences of others. However, as she interacted with fellow survivors at book signings, she felt compelled to share her own story. This marked a turning point in Knoll's life, as she began to confront the demons of her past and use her writing as a means of healing.\n\n**Reception**\n\nLuckiest Girl Alive has received widespread critical acclaim for its thought-provoking and emotionally charged exploration of themes such as trauma, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. The novel has been compared to other popular psychological thrillers, such as Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn and The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. Reviewers have praised Knoll's writing style, which is characterized by its vivid imagery, complex characters, and nuanced exploration of the human psyche.\n\nIn particular, reviewers have noted the novel's ability to create a sense of tension and suspense, even as it tackles difficult and uncomfortable themes. The novel's use of a non-linear narrative structure adds to its complexity, as Knoll jumps back and forth in time to reveal the secrets of Ani's past. This structure creates a sense of uncertainty and unease, mirroring the emotions of the protagonist as she navigates her own trauma.\n\n**Film Adaptation**\n\nIn April 2015, Lionsgate announced that they had obtained the film rights to Luckiest Girl Alive, with Reese Witherspoon's Pacific Standard set to produce. The film adaptation is currently in development, with a script written by Emily Giffin. The project is expected to be a major production, with a significant budget and a talented cast.\n\nThe film adaptation will likely be a key platform for promoting the novel and reaching a wider audience. With its thought-provoking themes and complex characters, Luckiest Girl Alive has the potential to be a major hit in the world of film. As the project moves forward, fans of the novel will be eagerly anticipating the opportunity to see Ani's story come to life on the big screen.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLuckiest Girl Alive is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that explores the complexities of human relationships and the darker aspects of life. Through its nuanced and emotionally charged narrative, Knoll challenges readers to confront their own moralities and question the notion of what constitutes a \"perfect\" life. As a novel, it is a testament to the power of writing as a therapeutic tool, and a reminder of the importance of confronting the scars of our past. With its film adaptation currently in development, Luckiest Girl Alive is poised to reach a wider audience and continue to spark important conversations about trauma, identity, and the human experience.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Luckiest_Girl_Alive\" following this outline:\n\n\nSynopsis\nAt first glance, 28-year-old Ani FaNelli appears to have a perfect life She works as an editor at a glamorous New York City women's magazine called The Women's Magazine and has a loving fiancé named Luke from a wealthy family Yet Ani also hides a secret – as a teenager, she underwent a series of horrifying and emotionally crippling events, including a school shooting, that have continued to impact her well into her adult years During the course of the novel, it is revealed Ani was gang raped when she was 14 She tried reaching out for help after the assault, but was subjected to cruel bullying and taunts by her peers, who did not believe her As the story progresses, Ani begins to question whether she is truly happy with who she has become, and if her current life is the one she wants and needs.\n\n\nDevelopment\nWhile writing the novel, Knoll drew upon her own experiences of being gang raped and bullied as a teenager [3] Knoll did not initially make this public knowledge while promoting the hardcover book, at first telling fans she based the rape and aftermath on stories she had heard from other rape survivors [4] In March 2016, Knoll wrote an essay for the online feminist newsletter Lenny Letter, describing her own experience She further stated that she came forward after interacting with several fellow rape survivors at book signings She said:\n\n\nReception\nCritical reception has been positive Luckiest Girl Alive has been compared to  Gone Girl (2012) by Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train (2015) [1] [6] [7] The book received praise from Entertainment Weekly and USA Today, the latter of which wrote that \"Recent newsworthy topics create a backdrop that can, at times, make the reader uncomfortable Yet the visceral tension Knoll creates actually complements the reading experience.\" [8] [9]\n\n\nFilm adaptation\nIn April 2015, Lionsgate announced that they had obtained the film rights to Luckiest Girl Alive, with Reese Witherspoon's Pacific Standard set to produce [10]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

At that time, Searchlight was a small, impoverished town. His father died of suicide in 1972, at the age of 58, when Harry was 32 years old.

In 1975, Reid ran for mayor of Las Vegas and lost to Bill Briare.\n\n**Member of the U.S. House of Representatives**\n\nBefore the 1980 Census, Nevada had only a single at-large member of the United States House of Representatives, but population growth in the 1970s resulted in the state picking up a second district. Reid won the Democratic nomination for the 1st district, based in Las Vegas, in 1982, and easily won the general election. He was re-elected in 1984.\n\n**U.S. Senate**\n\nIn 1986, Reid won the Democratic nomination for the seat of retiring two-term incumbent Republican Senator Paul Laxalt. Reid defeated former at-large U.S Representative Jim Santini, a Democrat who had turned Republican, in the November election. Reid ran for reelection in 1992, which he won by a double-digit margin. In 1998, he narrowly defeated U.S Representative John Ensign in the midst of a statewide Republican sweep. In 2004, Reid won reelection with 61 percent of the vote, defeating Richard Ziser.\n\n**Leadership**\n\nFrom 1999 to 2005, Reid served as Senate Democratic Whip, as minority whip from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2003 to 2005. Reid was majority whip from 2001 to 2003, except for a brief period from January to June 2001. He was the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee from January to June 2001 (succeeding Max Baucus) before relinquishing the position to allow Jim Jeffords to switch parties and become chair, having given Democrats the majority. From 2001 to 2003, he served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. Reid succeeded Tom Daschle as Minority Leader in 2005; he became Majority Leader after the 2006 election until 2015. He was again Minority Leader until his retirement in 2017 and was succeeded by Chuck Schumer.\n\n**UFOs**\n\nIn 2007, while he was the Senate Majority Leader, Reid initiated the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program to study unidentified flying objects at the urging of Reid's friend, Nevada billionaire and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow, and with support from the late senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii). The program began in the DIA in 2007 and was budgeted $22 million over its five years of operation.\n\n**Nuclear Option**\n\nOn November 21, 2013, under Reid's tenure as Majority Leader, the Democratic majority Senate voted 52–48 to eliminate the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster against all executive branch nominees and judicial nominees other than to the U.S Supreme Court. A 3/5 supermajority was still required to end filibusters unrelated to those nominees, such as for legislation and Supreme Court nominees. The Democrats' stated motivation for the \"nuclear option\" was expansion of filibustering by Republicans during the Obama administration, in particular blocking three nominations to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n**Ethics Controversies**\n\nReid was criticized during his tenure for several potentially self-enriching tactics. In 2005, Reid earmarked a spending bill to provide for building a bridge between Nevada and Arizona that would make land he owned more valuable. Reid called funding for the construction of a bridge over the Colorado River, among other projects, \"incredibly good news for Nevada\" in a news release after the passage of the 2006 transportation bill. He owned 160 acres of land several miles from the proposed bridge site in Arizona. The bridge could add value to his real estate investment. A year later, it was reported that Reid had used campaign donations to pay for $3,300 in Christmas gifts to the staff at the condominium where he resided. Federal election law prohibits candidates from using political donations for personal use. Reid's staff stated that his campaign attorneys had approved this use of the funds, but that Reid would personally reimburse his campaign for the expenses. Citizens United filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission to investigate the matter.\n\n**Committee Assignments**\n\nReid scored a lifetime conservative rating of 19% from the American Conservative Union (ACU) and a 2008 liberal rating of 70% from the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). Other independent ratings include a 29% rating in 2003 from NARAL, the abortion rights lobbyists, an 85% rating from Planned Parenthood in 2013, and a \"B\" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund.\n\n**Conservation Legacy**\n\nReid supported land conservation in Nevada. He successfully secured the designation of about 5.1 million acres of U.S federal land in Nevada as protected land, shielding them from development. Among these were the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, the Basin and Range National Monument, and the Gold Butte National Monument.\n\n**Cultural and Political Image**\n\nPart of Reid's confrontation with Frank Rosenthal while chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission is reenacted in the 1995 movie Casino. Reid had a role in the movie Traffic (2000), in which he played himself. He appeared, with Senators Sam Brownback and Barack Obama, in the 2007 documentary film Sand and Sorrow, which details the genocide in Sudan.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nReid met his wife, Landra Gould, in high school. Gould was from a Jewish family, and her parents objected to the relationship because Reid was not Jewish. The two eloped in 1959 when they were in college. The Reids had five children, a daughter, and four sons. Their eldest son, Rory, was an elected commissioner for Clark County, Nevada, of which he became chairman, and 2010 Democratic nominee in the election for Governor of Nevada. Another son, Josh Reid, unsuccessfully sought municipal office in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. In 2014 financial disclosure reports, Reid reported a net worth of between $2.9 million and $9.3 million. Most of Reid's net worth was in municipal securities and in land and mineral rights in southern Nevada and Arizona; a blind trust managed the liquid assets of Reid and his wife.\n\n**Health and Death**\n\nOn January 1, 2015, Reid was injured while exercising in his home. He said a piece of equipment he was using broke (later \"slipped\"), causing him to fall. As a result, he suffered broken ribs and broken facial bones, and was at risk of permanent vision loss in his right eye. On January 26, 2015, he underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from his right eye and repair facial bones. He later sued a company he claimed manufactured the device, alleging the device was defective. In 2019, a jury rejected his claim for lack of evidence.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, Reid had surgery for pancreatic cancer at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center after a tumor was found on his pancreas during a routine screening. In a January 2019 interview with The New York Times, it was revealed that he was confined to a desk at his home and was unable to move without the aid of a walker. Upon his diagnosis, he said: \"As soon as you discover you have something on your pancreas, you're dead.\" On February 25, 2019, he announced that due to early detection and chemotherapy, his cancer was in remission.\n\nReid died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Henderson on December 28, 2021, at the age of 82.

Weddings and a Funeral became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244 million, [7] making him an overnight international star His entry in The Trouble with Men: Masculinities in European and Hollywood Cinema states \"Four Weddings made him a truly international star whose image was endlessly promoted in tabloid newspaper articles, television chat shows and magazine profiles, especially in mass circulation women's magazines Grant was careful to play up to the affable and self-deprecating English gent His interviewers commented frequently on his romantic attractiveness, a modern matinée idol, blue eyed, very good looking in a classically English way, with his floppy hair and charming smile, his impeccable manners leavened by the occasional expletive\" [62]\n\n\n2000–2009: Continued romantic comedy roles\nWhile promoting Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks (2000) on NBC's The Today Show in 2000, Grant told host Matt Lauer, \"It's my

most unsympathetic characters Mr Allen has ever created\" [80] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, The New York Times wrote: \"Mr Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation.\" [81] In 2000, Grant also joined the supervisory board of IM Internationalmedia AG, the powerful Munich-based film and media company [82] In 2001, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary was proclaimed by Variety to be \"as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory\" [83] The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281 million worldwide [7] He was, according to The Washington Post, fitting as

So that was my submission to parliament – that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\" [12]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1987, while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont [61] He began dating Hurley during filming and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention [214] [215] While dating Hurley, Grant gained international notoriety for soliciting the services of prostitute Divine Brown, in 1995 They separated in May 2000 [216] Grant is godfather to Hurley's son Damian, born in 2002 [217]\n\n\nRelationships\nIn 1987, while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production Remando Al Viento (1988), Grant met actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was cast in a supporting role as Byron's former lover Claire Clairmont [61] He began dating Hurley during filming and their relationship was subsequently the subject of much media attention [214] [215] While dating Hurley, Grant gained international notoriety for soliciting the services of prostitute Divine Brown, in 1995 They separated in May 2000 [216] Grant is godfather to Hurley's son Damian, born in 2002 [217]\n\n\nPolitical views\nIn 2011, Grant appeared at the Liberal Democrats' conference on the News International phone-hacking scandal, where he briefly met then-party leader Nick Clegg Grant said that he was attending the Conservative and Labour conferences as well, but told Lib Dem activists that \"You, more than any of the other parties, have a good bill of health You have never been in bed with these scumbags.\" [230]\n\n\nSport\nAs a young boy, he played rugby union on his school's first XV team at centre and also played football He is a fan of Fulham and Como He continued to play in a Sunday-morning football league in south-west London after college and remains an \"impassioned Fulham supporter\" [35] His other interests include tennis [241] and snooker [242]\n\n\nRelationships with co-stars\nAfter production on Restoration ended, Grant's co-star, Robert Downey Jr., revealed that he and Grant did not get along during filming Downey said: \"I kinda think he's a jerk Don't know, I just think he is My personal experience with him is I think he's this kind of self-important, kind of, like, boring flash-in-the-pan asshole Brit.\" In 2018, Grant confirmed the on-set tension he and Downey had had, stating: \"He  [Downey] hated me He took one look at me and wanted to kill me I was so hurt.\" [244] As a result of Grant's confirmation of their decades-long feud, Downey went to Twitter to publicly make amends with Grant, to which Grant agreed [245]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nGrant is a patron of the DIPEx Charity, which operates the website Healthtalkonline [248] [249] [250] He is also patron of the Fynvola Foundation, named after his late mother; it supports the Lady Dane Farmhouse, a home in Faversham for adults with learning disabilities [251]\n\n\nInvestments\nIn 2001 Grant bought the print \"Liz\" by Andy Warhol for £2m He sold it in 2007 for £13m [258]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Hugh Grant\n\nHugh Grant is a British actor and director who has appeared in a wide range of films, including romantic comedies, dramas, and science fiction.

speak English, academic qualifications and working in an understaffed industry [88] In Parliament on 13 July 2020, Patel said the system \"will enable us to attract the brightest and best – a firmer and fairer system that will take back control of our borders, crack down on foreign criminals and unleash our country's true potential We are building a brighter future for Britain and signalling to the world that we are open for business\" [89]\n\n\nAsylum seekers\nIn August 2020, Patel suggested that many migrants were seeking to cross the English Channel to Britain because they believed that France was a \"racist country\" where they may be \"tortured\" Patel said she did not share those views, but it was a reason why many migrants were crossing the Channel [93] Patel has vowed to make the Channel \"unviable\" for migrant boats [94]\n\n\nReview of Border Force\nIn February 2022, Patel commissioned Alex Downer, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia's Liberal Party, to

alleged campaign briefing against him [114] Rutnam alleged that Patel had orchestrated a \"vicious\" campaign against him [115] Several days later, Patel sent an email to Home Office staff in which she expressed regret at Sir Philip's decision to resign and thanked him for his service [116] In April 2020, Rutnam announced that he would be making a claim of \"protected disclosure\" under

migrants from the United Kingdom was being \"frustrated by activist lawyers\" In response the Bar Council accused Patel of using \"divisive and deceptive language\" and the Liberal Democrats said the comments had \"a corrosive effect on the rule of law\" [134] Her tweet came a week after the Home Office was forced by Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft [135] to remove a video posted on its Twitter feed using similar terminology [136] Both the Bar Council and Law Society raised concerns about Patel's rhetoric with the Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland and Attorney-General Suella Braverman, who

[137] and which was allegedly linked to her comments [138] [139]\n\n\nRelations with Bahrain\nAs Home Secretary, Patel was keen to improve ties with the Gulf state Bahrain [141] In December 2020, she visited the kingdom to participate in the Manama Dialogue, where she met her counterpart and a number of senior Bahraini Government ministers [142] She also toured one of Bahrain's police departments,

working for the Russian authorities [152] [153] One of the callers impersonated Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, and asked Patel if she was ready to accept neo-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists into the country, referring to the claim by the Russian Government that its invasion of Ukraine was to \"denazify\" the country [154] Patel's comments were picked up by Russian state media, including RIA Novosti, which interpreted her comments as meaning she was \"ready to accept and help Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in every possible way\" [154] [155]\n\n\nResignation from the frontbench\nOn

British politician serving as the Shadow Foreign Secretary since November 2024. She was previously the Home Secretary from 2019 to 2022 and the International Development Secretary from 2016 to 2017. Patel has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Witham in Essex since 2010.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPriti Patel was born on 29 March 1972 to Sushil and Anjana Patel in London. Her paternal grandparents were born in Gujarat, India, before emigrating to Uganda, and running a convenience store in Kampala. In the 1960s, her parents emigrated to the UK and settled in Hertfordshire. They established a chain of newsagents throughout London and the South East of England. Patel was raised in a Hindu household. Her father Sushil was a UKIP candidate for Bushey South seat within Hertsmere District at the 2013 Hertfordshire County Council election.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nAfter graduating, Patel became an intern at Conservative Central Office (now known as Conservative Campaign Headquarters), having been selected by Andrew Lansley (then Head of the Conservative Research Department). From 1995 to 1997, Patel headed the press office of the Referendum Party. In 2000, Patel left her job with the Conservative Party to work for Weber Shandwick, a PR consulting firm. According to an investigative article published by The Guardian in May 2015, Patel was one of seven Weber Shandwick employees who worked on British American Tobacco (BAT), a major account. The team had been tasked with helping BAT manage the company's public image during the controversy around its Burmese factory being used as a source of funds by its military dictatorship and poor payment to factory workers. The crisis eventually ended with BAT pulling out of Myanmar in 2003. Patel worked for Weber Shandwick for three years.\n\n**Parliamentary Career**\n\nIn the 2005 UK general election, Patel stood as the Conservative candidate for Nottingham North, losing to the incumbent Labour MP Graham Allen. Patel finished in second place and won 18.7% of the vote. After her unsuccessful election campaign, she was identified as a promising candidate by new party leader David Cameron, and was offered a place on the \"A-List\" of Conservative Prospective Parliamentary Candidates (PPC). In November 2006, Patel was adopted as the PPC for the notionally safe Conservative seat of Witham, which was a new constituency in central Essex created after a boundary review. At the 2010 general election, Patel was elected to Parliament as MP for Witham, winning 52.2% of the vote and a majority of 15,196.\n\n**Member of Parliament for Witham: 2010–present**\n\nIn the 2005 UK general election, Patel stood as the Conservative candidate for Nottingham North, losing to the incumbent Labour MP Graham Allen.

At the 2010 general election, Patel was elected to Parliament as MP for Witham, winning 52.2% of the vote and a majority of 15,196.\n\n**Brexit Campaign: 2015–2016**\n\nFollowing Cameron's announcement of a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the European Union (EU), Patel was touted as a likely \"poster girl\" for the Vote Leave campaign. Patel said that the EU is \"undemocratic and interferes too much in our daily lives\". She publicly stated that immigration from elsewhere in the EU was overstretching the resources of UK schools. She helped to launch the Women for Britain campaign for anti-EU women; at their launch party, she compared their campaign with that of Emmeline Pankhurst and the Suffragettes, for which she was criticised by Emmeline's great-granddaughter Helen Pankhurst.\n\n**Secretary of State for International Development: 2016–2017**\n\nAfter becoming Prime Minister in July 2016, May appointed Patel to the post of Secretary of State for International Development. According to the New Statesman, some staff at the department were concerned about Patel's appointment, because of her support for Brexit and her longstanding scepticism regarding International Development and Aid spending.\n\n**Meetings with Israeli Officials and Resignation**\n\nOn 3 November 2017, it was revealed that Patel had held meetings in Israel in August 2017 without telling the Foreign Office. She was accompanied by Lord Polak, Honorary President of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI). The meetings, up to a dozen in number, took place while Patel was on a \"private holiday\". Patel met Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party, and reportedly made visits to several organisations where official departmental business was discussed. Patel recommended that the Department for International Development give international aid money to field hospitals run by the Israeli army in the Golan Heights. On 4 November 2017, in an interview with The Guardian, Patel stated that she had been uninvolved in an alleged campaign briefing against Philip Rutnam, the most senior civil servant in her department. However, Rutnam alleged that Patel had orchestrated a \"vicious\" campaign against him. Patel resigned as Secretary of State for International Development on 29 November 2017.\n\n**Backbencher: 2017–2019**\n\nIn May 2018, Patel questioned the impartiality of the Electoral Commission and called for it to investigate Britain Stronger in Europe or to end its inquiry into the Vote Leave campaign. Patel expressed concern that Britain Stronger in Europe had been provided with services by other remain campaigns without declaring the expenditure in the appropriate way. In August 2018, the Electoral Commission reported that there was no evidence that Britain Stronger in Europe had breached any laws on campaign spending.\n\n**Home Secretary: 2019–2022**\n\nPatel was appointed Home Secretary by Johnson in July 2019. Shortly after her appointment, news transpired that, in May 2019, Patel began working for Viasat as a strategic adviser on a salary of £5,000 a month for five hours' work a month, without seeking prior approval from the Government's Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, leading to accusations that she had broken the ministerial code for a second time. At the 2019 UK general election, Patel was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 66.6% and an increased majority of 24,082 votes.\n\n**Police and Crime**\n\nIn January 2020, a report by the Youth Empowerment and Innovation Project said that Patel's approach to tackling youth radicalisation was \"madness\" and the Home Office had been \"disengaged\". After the murder of Sir David Amess, Patel asked all police forces in the United Kingdom to review security arrangements for Members of Parliament.\n\n**Immigration**\n\nIn February 2020, Patel launched a points-based immigration system, which took effect from 1 January 2021. The system aims to reduce the number of immigrants to the UK by requiring visa applicants to meet a set of criteria, such as a salary threshold, ability to speak English, academic qualifications, and working in an understaffed industry. In Parliament on 13 July 2020, Patel said the system \"will enable us to attract the brightest and best – a firmer and fairer system that will take back control of our borders, crack down on foreign criminals, and unleash our country's true potential. We are building a brighter future for Britain and signalling to the world that we are open for business\".\n\n**Asylum Seekers**\n\nIn August 2020, Patel suggested that many migrants were seeking to cross the English Channel to Britain because they believed that France was a \"racist country\" where they may be \"tortured\". Patel said she did not share those views, but it was a reason why many migrants were crossing the Channel. Patel has vowed to make the Channel \"unviable\" for migrant boats.\n\n**Review of Border Force**\n\nIn February 2022, Patel commissioned Alex Downer, a former Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia's Liberal Party, to conduct an independent review of Border Force. Downer's appointment was criticized by Border Force's trade unions because of his support for Australia's widely criticised immigration policies.\n\n**Evidence of Bullying and Breach of Ministerial Code**\n\nIn February 2020, Patel came under scrutiny for trying to \"force out\" Sir Philip Rutnam, the most senior civil servant in her department. Rutnam resigned on 29 February, saying he would sue the Government for constructive dismissal, and that he did not believe Patel's assertion that she had been uninvolved in an alleged campaign briefing against him. Rutnam alleged that Patel had orchestrated a \"vicious\" campaign against him. Several days later, Patel sent an email to Home Office staff in which she expressed regret at Sir Philip's decision to resign and thanked him for his service. In April 2020, Rutnam announced that he would be making a claim of \"protected disclosure\" under whistleblowing laws. A ten-day employment tribunal hearing was scheduled for September 2021, at which it was expected Patel would be called to appear.\n\n**Protests and Cultural Issues**\n\nIn June 2020, Patel urged the public not to partake in the UK protests brought about by the murder of George Floyd in the United States, due to the Coronavirus outbreak. She criticised Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Bristol for toppling the statue of Edward Colston, calling it \"utterly disgraceful\". In February 2021, she described the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred in the UK in 2020 as \"dreadful\" and said she did not agree with the gesture of taking the knee.\n\n**Comments on the Legal Profession**\n\nOn 3 September 2020, Patel tweeted that the removal of migrants from the United Kingdom was being \"frustrated by activist lawyers\". In response, the Bar Council accused Patel of using \"divisive and deceptive language\", and the Liberal Democrats said the comments had \"a corrosive effect on the rule of law\". Her tweet came a week after the Home Office was forced by Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft to remove a video posted on its Twitter feed using similar terminology. Both the Bar Council and Law Society raised concerns about Patel's rhetoric with the Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland and Attorney-General Suella Braverman, who asked that she desist with her targeting of the legal profession. The intervention followed an alleged far-right terror attack at a solicitors' office, which took place four days after Patel's tweet and which was allegedly linked to her comments.\n\n**Relations with Bahrain**\n\nAs Home Secretary, Patel was keen to improve ties with the Gulf state Bahrain. In December 2020, she visited the kingdom to participate in the Manama Dialogue, where she met her counterpart and a number of senior Bahraini Government ministers. She also toured one of Bahrain's police departments, Muharraq Governorate Police, where several human rights activists have faced torture and sexual abuse by the authorities. The UK Home Office had granted asylum to a Bahraini democracy activist, Yusuf al Jamri, who was tortured and threatened with rape at the same police station. Patel was extensively condemned for her visit by human rights groups and the mistreated prisoners of Bahrain.\n\n**One-off Incidents**\n\nIn May 2021, Patel was accused of lobbying Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, on behalf of Pharmaceuticals Direct Ltd (PDL), a healthcare firm, that sought a government contract to provide personal protective equipment.

on the legal profession\nOn 3 September 2020, Patel tweeted that the removal of migrants from the United Kingdom was being \"frustrated by activist lawyers\" In response the Bar Council accused Patel of using \"divisive and deceptive language\" and the Liberal Democrats said the comments had \"a corrosive effect on the rule of law\" [134] Her tweet came a week after the Home Office was forced by Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft [135] to remove a video posted on its Twitter feed using similar terminology [136] Both the Bar Council and Law Society raised concerns about Patel's rhetoric with the Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland and Attorney-General Suella Braverman, who asked that she desist with her targeting of the legal profession The intervention followed an alleged far-right terror attack at a solicitors' office, which took place four days after Patel's tweet [137] and which was allegedly linked to her comments [138] [139]\n\n\nRelations with Bahrain\nAs Home Secretary, Patel

video call by Russian comedians Vovan and Lexus, who were accused by Britain of working for the Russian authorities [152] [153] One of the callers impersonated Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, and asked Patel if she was ready to accept neo-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists into the country, referring to the claim by the Russian Government that its invasion of Ukraine was to \"denazify\" the country [154] Patel's comments were picked up by Russian state media, including RIA Novosti, which interpreted her comments as meaning she was \"ready to accept and help Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in every possible way\" [154] [155]\n\n\nResignation from the frontbench\nOn 5 September 2022, in anticipation of the appointment of Liz Truss as Prime Minister, Patel tendered her

hero, [11] and has described herself as a \"massive Thatcherite,\" [170] with various news sources also characterising her as such; [11] [12] [32] while profiling Patel for The Independent, Tom Peck

to the ITF circuit afterwards, where she had a string of disappointing results This proved to be a turning point, as she later said she was determined to enjoy her singles tennis more [41] At the

Grand Slam tournament They reached the quarterfinals where they were defeated by her former partner Katerina Siniakova and her new partner Storm Hunter [117]\n\n\nPlaying style\nKrejčíkova is an aggressive player, with an all-court game She is known for her strong serve, powerful groundstrokes, and wholly complete net game [155] She has been noted for her ability to play with \"contained aggression\", and to spontaneously inject pace into rallies without notice As a result, she is capable of generating and redirecting power both crosscourt and down-the-line with both her groundstrokes, allowing her to hit winners, or induce unforced errors from opponents, with a high degree of accuracy [156] Her two-handed backhand is arguably her strongest groundstroke, with her being able to generate extreme angles with her backhand, and hit winners from any position on the court Krejčíkova can strategically apply slice to her backhand, continually breaking up the pace of rallies, allowing her to construct points intelligently Her forehand is also strong, being applied with heavy topspin, pushing opponents far behind the baseline, and allowing her to dictate rallies She also frequently deploys the sliced forehand, a rare shot in modern tennis, to surprise opponents and aid point construction Krejčíkova is an exceptional net player due to her doubles experience, and possesses a complete repertoire of shots to perform at the net [157] Although Krejčíkova typically plays at the baseline until the opportunity arises to attack the net, she occasionally utilises the serve-and-volley tactic to surprise opponents, and win points easily She also possesses a highly effective drop shot, which typically lands close to the net, surprising opponents in long baseline rallies; if the opponent manages to retrieve the shot, her strong volleying skills allow her to end the point quickly with an aggressive volley, or a perfectly weighted lob., [158] which was instrumental in her defeat of Sakkari in the Roland Garros 2021 semi-final and the winning shot in the 2022 Australian Open doubles final In the post-match press conference, Krejcikova revealed this was a talent she developed as a junior when the deep lobs would bounce over her shorter opponents’ heads and over the fence!

suddenly, in late May, she reached her first WTA singles final at the Nurember Cup, where she played from the qualifying rounds She lost the final to top seed Kiki Bertens [20] This result brought her

played in the quarterfinal, where she lost to Caroline Garcia [21] For the first time, she had the chance to play in the main draw of the Rogers Cup, but lost in the second round of qualification At

finally qualified at the Rogers Cup, where she lost in the first round At the majors, she also made a little bit of progress, as she finally made it to the main draw of the French Open after

Second mixed doubles Australian Open title\nIn the COVID-affected 2020 season, Krejčíková finally made progress in singles For the first time in her career, she qualified for the main draw of the Australian Open, beating Kaia Kanepi before losing to Ekaterina Alexandrova in the second round \nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Krejčíková took part in Czech tennis tournaments against players like Petra Kvitová and Karolína Muchová When the tour restarted in August, Krejčíková impressed in a three-set loss to Simona Halep She returned to the ITF circuit afterwards, where she had a string of disappointing results This proved to be a turning point, as she later said she was determined to enjoy her singles tennis more [41] At the French Open in September, Krejčíková had a massive breakthrough, reaching the round of 16 There, she lost to qualifier Nadia Podoroska [42] She followed with good performances in Ostrava and Linz, where she lost to Victoria Azarenka in the round of 16 and Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals, respectively Krejčíková ended the year ranked world No 65 in singles.\n\n\n2021: French Open titles, Olympic gold & WTA Finals champion\nKrejčíková began the

the final; her match against Kontaveit was particularly remarkable, as she came back from being bagelled in the first set to winning a final-set tiebreak 14–12, saving 7 match points She lost in the final via another final-set tiebreak to fifth seed Paula Badosa.\n\n\n2023: Australian Open doubles and WTA 1000 singles titles\nKrejčíková started her 2023 season at 2023 Adelaide International 2 Having struggled with a left wrist injury since Fort Worth, she lost in the second round to Daria Kasatkina.\n\n\n2024: Wimbledon champion, WTA Finals semifinal\nKrejcikova began 2024 with a run to the quarterfinal at the Australian Open, recording wins over wildcard entrant Mai Hontama, [112] Tamara Korpach, [113] qualifier Storm Hunter [114] and Mirra Andreeva [115] Ultimately she was defeated by eventual champion Aryna Sabalenka [116] In doubles, she was playing with Laura Siegemund for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament They reached the quarterfinals where they were defeated by her former partner Katerina Siniakova and her new partner Storm Hunter [117]\n\n\nPlaying style\nKrejčíkova is an aggressive player, with an all-court game She is known for her strong serve, powerful groundstrokes, and wholly complete net game [155] She has been noted for her ability to play with \"contained aggression\", and to spontaneously inject pace into rallies without notice As a result, she is capable of generating and redirecting power both crosscourt and down-the-line with both her groundstrokes, allowing her to hit winners, or induce unforced errors from opponents, with a high degree of accuracy [156] Her two-handed backhand is arguably her strongest groundstroke, with her being able to generate extreme angles with her backhand, and hit winners from any position on the court Krejčíkova can strategically apply slice to her backhand, continually breaking up the pace of rallies, allowing her to construct points intelligently Her forehand is also strong, being applied with heavy topspin, pushing opponents far behind the baseline, and allowing her to dictate rallies She also frequently deploys the sliced forehand, a rare shot in modern tennis, to surprise opponents and aid point construction Krejčíkova is an exceptional net player due to her doubles experience, and possesses a complete repertoire of shots to perform at the net [157] Although Krejčíkova typically plays at the baseline until the opportunity arises to attack the net, she occasionally utilises the serve-and-volley tactic to surprise opponents, and win points easily She also possesses a highly effective drop shot, which typically lands close to the net, surprising opponents in long baseline rallies; if the opponent manages to retrieve the shot, her strong volleying skills allow her to end the point quickly with an aggressive volley, or a perfectly weighted lob., [158] which was instrumental in her defeat of Sakkari in the Roland Garros 2021 semi-final and the winning shot in the 2022 Australian Open doubles final In the post-match press conference, Krejcikova revealed this was a talent she developed as a junior when the deep lobs would bounce over her shorter opponents’ heads and over the fence! [159]\n\n\nEndorsements\nKrejčíková signed an endorsement deal in 2022 with Fila for clothing, footwear, and apparel [163] She is endorsed by Head for racquets, specifically using the Head Extreme racquet; she was previously sponsored by Head for clothing and footwear, until switching to Fila She is also sponsored by Roko-Motor, the Czech division of Jaguar Land Rover.\n\n\nCareer statistics\n\n\n\nGrand Slam performance timelines\n\n\n\nSingles\n\n\n\nDoubles\n\n\n\nMixed doubles\n\n\n\nGrand Slam tournament finals\n\n\n\nSingles: 2 (2 titles)\n\n\n\nDoubles: 8 (7 titles, 1 runner-up)\n\n\n\nMixed doubles: 3 (3 titles)\n\n\n\nOlympic medal matches\n\n\n\nDoubles: 1 (gold medal)\n\n\n\nYear-end championships finals\n\n\n\nDoubles: 3 (1 title, 2 runner-ups)\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

DarkStar; another was the Global Hawk Due to budget cuts, only one of the programs could survive It was decided to proceed with the Global Hawk for its range and payload rather than go with the stealth Dark Star [6]\n\n\nOrigins\nIn the 1990s, the Air Force was developing uncrewed aerial intelligence platforms One was the stealthy Lockheed Martin RQ-3 DarkStar; another was the Global Hawk Due to budget cuts, only one of the programs could survive It was decided to proceed with the Global Hawk for its range and payload rather than go with the stealth Dark Star [6]\n\n\nUnited States Navy version\nThe United States Navy took delivery of two of the Block 10 aircraft to evaluate their maritime surveillance capabilities, designated N-1 (BuNo 166509) and N-2 (BuNo 166510) [14] The initial navalised example was tested at Edwards Air Force Base briefly, before moving to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in March 2006 for the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program, [15] operated by Navy squadron VX-20 [16] [17]\n\n\nCost increases and procurement\nDevelopment cost overruns placed the Global Hawk at risk of cancellation In mid-2006, per-unit costs were 25% over baseline estimates, caused by both the need to correct design deficiencies as well as to increase its capabilities This caused concern over a possible congressional termination of the program if its national security benefits could not be justified [23] [24] However, in June 2006, the program was restructured Completion of an operational assessment report by the USAF was delayed from 2005 to 2007 due to manufacturing and development delays The operational assessment report was released in March 2007 and production of the 54 air vehicles planned was extended by two years to 2015 [25]\n\n\nEuroHawk\nThe German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ordered a variant of the RQ-4B, to be equipped with a customized sensor suite, designated \"EuroHawk\" The aircraft was based on the RQ-4B Block 20/30/40 and was to be equipped with an EADS-built signals intelligence (SIGINT) package; it was intended to fulfill Germany's requirement to replace their aging Dassault-Breguet Atlantique electronic surveillance aircraft of the Marineflieger (Naval Air arm of the German Navy) The EADS sensor package is composed of six wing-mounted pods; [39] reportedly these sensor pods could potentially be used on other platforms, including crewed aircraft [40]\n\n\nUniversal Payload Adapter and new payloads\nIn January 2014, President Obama signed a budget that included a $10 million (~$12.7 million in 2023) study on adapting the U-2's superior sensors for the RQ-4 [58] In April 2015, Northrop Grumman reportedly installed the U-2's Optical Bar Camera (OBC) and Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS-2B/C) sensors onto the RQ-4 using a Universal Payload Adapter (UPA) Successful testing indicated that all RQ-4s could be similarly retrofitted [59]\n\n\nRange Hawk\nAlthough the Global Hawk is being retired from combat use, the Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is acquiring them to support the SkyRange program to test hypersonic missiles by 2024 Tests are currently monitored by ships, but it can take a ship 21 days to be positioned and outfitted for use, limiting flights to about a dozen airborne demonstrations a year By using unmanned aircraft to track hypersonic systems, faster availability and deployment could support a test rate of up to one per week To perform this new mission, the Global Hawk is retrofitted into the Range Hawk, which involves configuring it to look up rather than down by repositioning onboard avionics and installing new sensors and instrumentation suites to track an overhead hypersonic vehicle The program will use four Block 20 and 20 Block 30 airframes retired from USAF service [66] Converted Block 10 Range Hawks supported 10 hypersonic flight tests in 2023, including two tests in

unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used by the United States Air Force and other countries for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. Developed by Northrop Grumman, the Global Hawk is a key component of the US military's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Global Hawk is a remotely piloted aircraft that can fly for up to 32 hours and reach altitudes of over 60,000 feet. It is powered by a single turbofan engine and has a wingspan of 116 feet. The aircraft is designed to carry a variety of sensors, including electro-optical, infrared, and radar systems, which provide high-resolution images and data to support military and civilian operations.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn the 1990s, the Air Force was developing uncrewed aerial intelligence platforms, including the stealthy Lockheed Martin RQ-3 DarkStar and the Global Hawk. Due to budget cuts, only one of the programs could survive, and it was decided to proceed with the Global Hawk due to its range and payload capabilities. The Global Hawk was developed as part of the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, which aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a high-altitude, long-endurance UAV.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe Global Hawk was developed by Northrop Grumman in collaboration with the Air Force, DARPA, and other industry partners. The aircraft was designed to be a remotely piloted system, with a ground control station and a launch and recovery element. The Global Hawk was initially intended to be a surveillance platform, but it has since been adapted for a variety of missions, including reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication relay.\n\n**United States Navy version**\n\nThe United States Navy took delivery of two Block 10 Global Hawk aircraft to evaluate their maritime surveillance capabilities. The initial navalized example was tested at Edwards Air Force Base before moving to Naval Air Station Patuxent River for the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program. The GHMD program was operated by Navy squadron VX-20 and aimed to demonstrate the Global Hawk's capabilities for maritime surveillance.\n\n**Cost increases and procurement**\n\nDevelopment cost overruns placed the Global Hawk at risk of cancellation, with per-unit costs 25% over baseline estimates. However, in June 2006, the program was restructured, and production of the 54 air vehicles planned was extended by two years to 2015. The operational assessment report was released in March 2007, and the program has since continued to evolve with new capabilities and sensors being added.\n\n**EuroHawk**\n\nThe German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ordered a variant of the RQ-4B, designated \"EuroHawk,\" which was equipped with a customized sensor suite. The EuroHawk was based on the RQ-4B Block 20/30/40 and was intended to fulfill Germany's requirement to replace their aging Dassault-Breguet Atlantique electronic surveillance aircraft.\n\n**Universal Payload Adapter and new payloads**\n\nIn 2014, President Obama signed a budget that included a $10 million study on adapting the U-2's superior sensors for the RQ-4. In 2015, Northrop Grumman installed the U-2's Optical Bar Camera (OBC) and Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS-2B/C) sensors onto the RQ-4 using a Universal Payload Adapter (UPA). Successful testing indicated that all RQ-4s could be similarly retrofitted.\n\n**Range Hawk**\n\nThe Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is acquiring the Global Hawk to support the SkyRange program, which will test hypersonic missiles by 2024. The Global Hawk is being retrofitted into the Range Hawk, which involves configuring it to look up rather than down by repositioning onboard avionics and installing new sensors and instrumentation suites. The Range Hawk will be used to track hypersonic systems and support a test rate of up to one per week.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe Global Hawk UAV system comprises the RQ-4 air vehicle, which is outfitted with various equipment such as sensor packages and communication systems, and a ground element consisting of a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and a Mission Control Element (MCE) with ground communications equipment. Each RQ-4 air vehicle is powered by an Allison Rolls-Royce AE3007H turbofan engine with 7,050 lbf thrust, and carries a payload of 2,000 pounds.\n\n**Operational history**\n\nFollowing the September 11th attacks, the normal acquisition process was bypassed almost immediately, and early developmental Global Hawk models were employed in overseas contingency operations beginning in November 2001.

While their data-collection capabilities have been praised, the program lost four prototype aircraft out of six or seven to accidents.\n\n**U.S. Air Force**\n\nThe U.S. Air Force operates the Global Hawk as a key component of its ISR capabilities. The Global Hawk is used for a variety of missions, including reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication relay. The aircraft has been deployed in support of operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other regions.\n\n**Records**\n\nOn 24 April 2001, a Global Hawk flew non-stop from Edwards AFB to RAAF Base Edinburgh in Australia, making history by being the first pilotless aircraft to cross the Pacific Ocean. The flight took 22 hours and set a world record for absolute distance flown by a UAV, 13,219.86 kilometers.\n\n**Downing by Iran**\n\nOn 19 June 2019, a U.S Navy BAMS-D RQ-4A from NAS Patuxent River flying over the Persian Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz was shot down by a 3rd Khordad surface-to-air missile fired from near Garuk, Iran.

The Global Hawk was to be assessed against the General Atomics MQ-9 Mariner in trials in 2007. However, the Australian government decided not to proceed and canceled the order.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe Global Hawk has several variants, including the RQ-4B, RQ-4D, and RQ-4N. The RQ-4B is the basic version of the aircraft, while the RQ-4D is a variant used by NATO. The RQ-4N is a variant used by Japan.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe Global Hawk is operated by several countries, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and NATO. The aircraft is used for a variety of missions, including reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication relay.\n\n**Accidents**\n\nThe Global Hawk has been involved in several accidents, including the loss of four prototype aircraft out of six or seven. The program has also experienced technical issues and delays.\n\n**Specifications (RQ-4B Block 30/40)**\n\nThe RQ-4B Block 30/40 has a wingspan of 116 feet, a length of 47 feet, and a height of 14 feet. The aircraft weighs 13,500 pounds and has a payload capacity of 2,000 pounds.

Hawk\nAlthough the Global Hawk is being retired from combat use, the Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is acquiring them to support the SkyRange program to test hypersonic missiles by 2024 Tests are currently monitored by ships, but it can take a ship 21 days to be positioned and outfitted for use, limiting flights to about a dozen airborne demonstrations a year By using unmanned aircraft to track hypersonic systems, faster availability and deployment could support a test rate of up to one per week To perform this new mission, the Global Hawk is retrofitted into the Range Hawk, which involves configuring it to look up rather than down by repositioning onboard avionics and installing new sensors and instrumentation suites to track an overhead hypersonic vehicle The program will use four Block 20 and 20 Block 30 airframes retired from USAF service [66] Converted Block 10 Range Hawks supported 10 hypersonic flight tests in 2023, including two tests in

{"title": "Sukhoi_Su-27", "content": "\nDevelopment\nIn 1969, the Soviet Union learned of the U.S Air Force's \"F-X\" program, which resulted in the F-15 Eagle The Soviet leadership soon realized that the new American fighter would represent a serious technological advantage over existing Soviet fighters \"What was needed was a better-balanced fighter with both good agility and sophisticated systems.\" In response, the Soviet General Staff issued a requirement for a Perspektivnyy Frontovoy Istrebitel (PFI, literally \"Prospective Frontline Fighter\", roughly \"Advanced Frontline Fighter\") [3] Specifications were extremely ambitious, calling for long-range, good short-field performance (including the ability to use austere runways), excellent agility, Mach 2+ speed, and heavy armament The aerodynamic design for the new aircraft was largely carried out by TsAGI in collaboration with the Sukhoi design bureau [3]\n\n\nAir Force\nThe T-10 was spotted by Western observers and assigned the NATO reporting name 'Flanker-A' The development of the T-10 was marked by considerable problems, leading to a fatal crash of the second prototype, the T-10-2 on 7 July 1978, [4] due to shortcomings in the fly-by-wire control system [5] Extensive redesigns followed (T-10-3 through T-10-15) and a revised version of the T-10-7, now designated the T-10S, made its first flight on 20 April 1981 It also crashed due to control problems and was replaced by T-10-12 which became T-10S-2 This one also crashed on 23 December 1981 during a high-speed test, killing the pilot [6] Eventually the T-10-15 demonstrator, T-10S-3, evolved into the definitive Su-27 configuration [7]\n\n\nNavy\nDevelopment of a version for the Soviet Navy designated Su-27K (from Korabyelny - \"shipborne\", NATO designation 'Flanker-D') commenced not long after the development of the main land-based type Some of the T-10 demonstrators were modified to test features of navalized variants for carrier operations These modified demonstrators led to specific prototypes for the Soviet Navy, designated \"T-10K\" The T-10Ks had canards, an arresting hook and carrier landing avionics as well as a retractable inflight refueling probe They did not have the landing gear required for carrier landings or folding wings The first T-10K flew in August 1987 flown by the famous Soviet test pilot Viktor Pugachev (who first demonstrated the Cobra maneuver using an Su-27 in 1989), performing test takeoffs from a land-based ski-jump carrier deck on the Black Sea coast at Saky in the Ukrainian SSR The aircraft was lost in an accident in 1988.\n\n\nExport and post-Soviet development\nIn 1991, the production facilities at Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant and Irkutsk developed export variants of the Su-27: the Su-27SK single seat fighter and Su-27UBK twin-seat trainer, (the K in both variants is Russian for \"Kommercheskiy\" - literally \"Commercial\") [18]which have been exported to China, Vietnam, Ethiopia and Indonesia [19]\nAfter the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia, the successor state, started development of advanced variants of the Su-27 including the Su-30, Su-33, Su-34, Su-35, and Su-37.\n\n\nDesign\nThe Su-27's basic design is aerodynamically similar to the MiG-29, but it is substantially larger The wings are  attached to the center of the fuselage at the leading edge extensions, featuring a semi-delta design, with the tips cropped for missile rails or ECM pods The fighter is also an example of a tailed delta wing configuration, retaining conventional horizontal tailplanes [26]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe Soviet Air Force began receiving Su-27s in June 1985 [12] The first frontline unit to receive the Su-27 was the 831st Fighter Aviation Regiment at Myrhorod Air Base, Ukrainian SSR, in November 1985 [28] [29]   It officially entered service in August 1990 [12]\n\n\nSoviet Union and Russia\nThe Soviet Air Force began receiving Su-27s in June 1985 [12] The first frontline unit to receive the Su-27 was the 831st Fighter Aviation Regiment at Myrhorod Air Base, Ukrainian SSR, in November 1985 [28] [29]   It officially entered service in August 1990 [12]\n\n\nChina\nChina was the first foreign operator of Su-27 and the only country to acquire the fighter before the fall of the Soviet Union The deal, known as the '906 Project' in China, [44] marked a leap in Chinese aviation capability in the 1990s Discussion of the aircraft purchase began in 1988 when the Soviet Union offered China fourth-generation fighters like MiG-29 However, the

Union in the 1970s and 1980s. The Su-27 has been in service with several countries, including Russia, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Ukraine.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Su-27 was designed to counter the threat of the U.S. Air Force's F-15 Eagle, which was considered a superior fighter at the time. The Soviet leadership recognized the need for a better-balanced fighter with excellent agility and sophisticated systems. The Su-27 was the result of this requirement, with a design that combined advanced avionics, maneuverability, and heavy armament.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn 1969, the Soviet Union learned of the U.S. Air Force's \"F-X\" program, which resulted in the F-15 Eagle. The Soviet leadership soon realized that the new American fighter would represent a serious technological advantage over existing Soviet fighters. What was needed was a better-balanced fighter with both good agility and sophisticated systems. In response, the Soviet General Staff issued a requirement for a Perspektivnyy Frontovoy Istrebitel (PFI, literally \"Prospective Frontline Fighter\", roughly \"Advanced Frontline Fighter\").\n\nSpecifications were extremely ambitious, calling for long-range, good short-field performance (including the ability to use austere runways), excellent agility, Mach 2+ speed, and heavy armament. The aerodynamic design for the new aircraft was largely carried out by TsAGI in collaboration with the Sukhoi design bureau.\n\n**Air Force**\n\nThe T-10 was spotted by Western observers and assigned the NATO reporting name 'Flanker-A'. The development of the T-10 was marked by considerable problems, leading to a fatal crash of the second prototype, the T-10-2 on 7 July 1978, due to shortcomings in the fly-by-wire control system. Extensive redesigns followed (T-10-3 through T-10-15) and a revised version of the T-10-7, now designated the T-10S, made its first flight on 20 April 1981. It also crashed due to control problems and was replaced by T-10-12 which became T-10S-2 This one also crashed on 23 December 1981 during a high-speed test, killing the pilot. Eventually the T-10-15 demonstrator, T-10S-3, evolved into the definitive Su-27 configuration.\n\n**Navy**\n\nDevelopment of a version for the Soviet Navy designated Su-27K (from Korabyelny - \"shipborne\", NATO designation 'Flanker-D') commenced not long after the development of the main land-based type. Some of the T-10 demonstrators were modified to test features of navalized variants for carrier operations. These modified demonstrators led to specific prototypes for the Soviet Navy, designated \"T-10K\". The T-10Ks had canards, an arresting hook and carrier landing avionics as well as a retractable inflight refueling probe. They did not have the landing gear required for carrier landings or folding wings. The first T-10K flew in August 1987 flown by the famous Soviet test pilot Viktor Pugachev (who first demonstrated the Cobra maneuver using an Su-27 in 1989), performing test takeoffs from a land-based ski-jump carrier deck on the Black Sea coast at Saky in the Ukrainian SSR. The aircraft was lost in an accident in 1988.\n\n**Export and post-Soviet development**\n\nIn 1991, the production facilities at Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant and Irkutsk developed export variants of the Su-27: the Su-27SK single seat fighter and Su-27UBK twin-seat trainer, (the K in both variants is Russian for \"Kommercheskiy\" - literally \"Commercial\") which have been exported to China, Vietnam, Ethiopia and Indonesia. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Russia, the successor state, started development of advanced variants of the Su-27 including the Su-30, Su-33, Su-34, Su-35, and Su-37.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe Su-27's basic design is aerodynamically similar to the MiG-29, but it is substantially larger. The wings are attached to the center of the fuselage at the leading edge extensions, featuring a semi-delta design, with the tips cropped for missile rails or ECM pods. The fighter is also an example of a tailed delta wing configuration, retaining conventional horizontal tailplanes.\n\n**Operational history**\n\nThe Soviet Air Force began receiving Su-27s in June 1985. The first frontline unit to receive the Su-27 was the 831st Fighter Aviation Regiment at Myrhorod Air Base, Ukrainian SSR, in November 1985. It officially entered service in August 1990.\n\n**Soviet Union and Russia**\n\nThe Soviet Air Force began receiving Su-27s in June 1985. The first frontline unit to receive the Su-27 was the 831st Fighter Aviation Regiment at Myrhorod Air Base, Ukrainian SSR, in November 1985. It officially entered service in August 1990.\n\n**China**\n\nChina was the first foreign operator of Su-27 and the only country to acquire the fighter before the fall of the Soviet Union. The deal, known as the '906 Project' in China, marked a leap in Chinese aviation capability in the 1990s. Discussion of the aircraft purchase began in 1988 when the Soviet Union offered China fourth-generation fighters like MiG-29. However, the Chinese negotiator insisted on purchasing the Su-27, the most sophisticated fighter Soviets had at the time. The sales were approved in December 1990, with three fighters delivered to China before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia completed the contract and allowed China to manufacture the Su-27 domestically, where the aircraft is designated as J-11.\n\n**Ethiopia**\n\nEthiopian Su-27s shot down two Eritrean MiG-29s and damaged another one during the Eritrean-Ethiopian War in February 1999 and destroyed another two in May 2000.

manufacturer. The tank is part of the Armata family of vehicles, which also includes the T-15 infantry fighting vehicle and the T-16 armored recovery vehicle.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe T-14 Armata is a significant development in the field of main battle tanks, featuring cutting-edge design and advanced technology. The tank was initially developed as a replacement for the T-90, and its production was expected to begin in 2020. However, delays and changes in the Russian military's priorities have pushed the production timeline back.\n\n**History**\n\nThe development of the T-14 Armata began in 2010, after the cancellation of the T-95 project. The new tank was designed to address the limitations of the T-90, which had been in service since the 1990s. The T-14 was based on the T-95 design, which itself was based on the Object 187. The Russian Army curtailed T-90 orders in 2012 to prepare for the arrival of the new tank.\n\n**Procurement**\n\nIn 2016, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it had signed a contract for a \"test batch\" of 100 T-14 tanks to be delivered by 2020. The full project was expected to be completed by 2025. However, the production timeline has been pushed back due to various factors, including delays in the development of the tank's advanced technology.\n\n**Claims of Deployment in Ukraine**\n\nIn December 2022, Russian TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov posted footage of the T-14 in combat training, with other sources claiming that the tank was being prepared for battle and already deployed to the conflict zone. Military experts suggested that the videos were probably shot near Kazan.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe T-14 Armata was designed over the course of five years, featuring a number of innovative characteristics. The tank has an unmanned turret, with the crew of three seated in an armored capsule in the front of the hull. The capsule also includes a toilet for the crew. The design of the tank is intended to provide the crew with maximum protection and comfort.\n\n**Armament**\n\nThe T-14 Armata is equipped with a 2A82-1M 125mm gun, which is capable of firing a range of ammunition, including the Vacuum-1 Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) round. The APFSDS round has a penetrator that is 900mm long, and is said to be capable of penetrating 1000mm of Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) equivalent at a distance of 2km. The tank is also equipped with a controlled-detonation Teknik HE-Frag shell, which has entered service. Additionally, the tank can fire new guided missiles, including the 9M119M1 Invar-M, which has an effective range of 100m to 5km.\n\n**Mobility**\n\nThe T-14 Armata is powered by a ChTZ 12N360 (A-85-3A) diesel engine, which delivers up to 1,100kW (1,500hp). The engine's theoretical maximum power is 1,500kW (2,000hp), but this would radically decrease its service life. The tank is expected to have a minimum service life of 2,000 hours at a nominal 1,100kW (1,500hp), and up to 10,000 hours at a moderated 890kW (1,200hp). The tank's operational range is over 500km (300mi).\n\n**Protection**\n\nThe T-14 Armata's main protective armor is built with a new steel codenamed 44S-SV-SH, which has extremely high durability and is able to withstand extreme temperature environments. The armor is 15% lighter than steel used on older tanks. The tank also features composite armor, with an unknown ceramic layer, and Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) within its base design. The ERA is a continuous layer, rather than being added in the form of \"bricks.\"\n\n**Sensors and Communication**\n\nThe T-14 Armata is equipped with 26.5–40GHz active electronically scanned array radar, which is used mainly by the Active Protection System (APS). The tank uses highly protected communication channels that connect a group of T-14s and the command post.\n\n**Variants**\n\nAn unmanned version of the Armata, called Tachanka-B, is planned and is currently in development.\n\n**Export**\n\nVladimir Kozhin, a Russian presidential aide, said in 2015 that Russia's foreign partners, including China and India, have expressed interest in purchasing new military equipment presented at the 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, including the Armata tank.

Collins put forward \"Please Don't Ask\" and \"Misunderstanding\" [79]\n\n\n1984–1989: No Jacket Required and commercial ubiquity\nCollins wrote and performed on \"Against All Odds\", the main theme for the romantic film of the same name, which demonstrated a more pop-orientated and commercially accessible sound than his previous work Released in February 1984, it was the first single of his solo career to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it peaked at number two in the UK Collins won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male [72] The song earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, and he arranged his 1985 tour to accommodate the possibility of performing it at the awards ceremony However, a note to Atlantic Records from show producer Larry Gelbart explaining a lack of invitation stated: \"Thank you for your note regarding Phil Cooper  [sic] I'm afraid the spots have already been filled\", and Collins watched actress and dancer Ann Reinking perform it [91] The Los Angeles Times said: \"Reinking did an incredible job of totally destroying a beautiful song.\" [92] Collins would introduce it at subsequent concerts by saying: \"I'm sorry Miss Ann Reinking couldn't be here tonight;

Live!, a live album recorded during Collins's Seriously, Live! World Tour in 1990 They claimed they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded that the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved [284] On 19 April 2000, the High Court in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it The judge agreed with Collins's argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit \"Sussudio\" [285]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2000, Collins developed sudden hearing loss in his left ear following a recording session in Los Angeles He consulted three doctors, who reportedly told him that there was nothing they could do and that the chance of a full recovery was slim Two years later, he had recovered most of his hearing [286] Collins later found that it was caused by a viral infection, and that it was resolved after treatment [135]\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nCollins has received several honorary degrees in recognition of his work in music and his personal interests In 1987, he received an honorary doctorate of fine arts at Fairleigh Dickinson University [298] In 1991, he received an honorary doctorate of music at the Berklee College of Music [299] On 12 May 2012, he received an honorary doctorate of history at the McMurry University in Abilene, Texas, [300] for his research and collection of Texas Revolution artefacts and documents (see other interests section).\n\n\nPolitics\nCollins has often been mentioned erroneously in the British media as being a supporter of the Conservative Party and a critic of the Labour Party [226] [301] This derives from the famous article in The Sun, printed on the day of the 1992 UK general election, titled \"If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights\", which stated that Collins was among several celebrities who were planning to leave Britain in the event of a Labour victory [302] [303]\n\n\nOther interests\nCollins has a long-standing interest in the Alamo He has collected hundreds of artefacts related to the famous 1836 battle in San Antonio, Texas, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and has spoken at related events [315] His passion for the Battle of the Alamo has also led him to write the book The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector's Journey, published in 2012 [316] A short film was released in 2013 called Phil Collins and the Wild Frontier which captures Collins on a book tour in June 2012 [317] On 26 June 2014, a press conference was held from the Alamo, where Collins spoke, announcing that he was donating his entire collection to the Alamo via the State of Texas [318] On 11 March 2015, in honour of his donation, Collins was named an honorary Texan by the state legislature [319]\n\n\nCharity work\nCollins has performed at the Secret Policeman's Ball, a benefit show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese on behalf of Amnesty International He made his first appearance at the 1981 show held in London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and he subsequently became an activist [323] Collins was appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in the 1994 Birthday Honours, in recognition of his work on behalf of The Prince's Trust, a leading UK youth charity founded by King Charles III (then-Prince of Wales) which provides training, personal development, business start up support, mentoring, and advice [324] Since appearing at the first Prince's Trust's rock concert in 1982 which included a performance as part of singer Kate Bush's backing band, Collins has played at the event numerous times since, most recently at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010 [325] [326]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nStudio albums\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nConcert tours\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Phil Collins is a British musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who is best known as the drummer and vocalist of the rock band Genesis, and as a successful solo artist. He has been active in the music industry since the 1960s and has released numerous albums and singles that have been successful in various genres, including rock, pop, and R&B.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPhilip David Charles Collins was born on 30 January 1951 at Putney Hospital in Wandsworth, south-west London. His father, Greville Philip Austin Collins, was an insurance agent, and his mother, Winifred June Collins, worked in a toy shop and later as a booking agent at the Barbara Speake Stage School. Collins is the youngest of three children, with a sister Carole who competed as a professional ice skater and a brother Clive who was a noted cartoonist. The family moved twice by the time Collins was two years old, settling at 453 Hanworth Road in Hounslow, Middlesex.\n\n**Career**\n\nCollins quit school at the age of 14 to become a full-time pupil at Barbara Speake. He had an uncredited part as an extra in the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night, where he is amongst the screaming teenagers during the television concert sequence. Later in 1964, Collins was cast as the Artful Dodger in two West End runs of the musical Oliver! He was paid £15 a week and called the role \"the best part for a kid in all London.\" His days as the Dodger were numbered when his voice broke during a performance and he had to speak his lines for the rest of the show.\n\nCollins starred in Calamity the Cow, a film produced by the Children's Film Foundation, and decided to quit acting to pursue music. He was to appear in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as one of the children who storm the castle, but his scene was cut. Collins auditioned for the role of Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, but the role went to Leonard Whiting. In 1967, he travelled the UK teaching people the \"crunch\" dance made popular by a Smith's crisps advertising campaign.\n\n**1963–1970: Early Acting Roles and Bands**\n\nCollins quit school at the age of 14 to become a full-time pupil at Barbara Speake.

In 1967, he travelled the UK teaching people the \"crunch\" dance made popular by a Smith's crisps advertising campaign.\n\n**1970–1978: Genesis, Later Role as Lead Singer, and Brand X**\n\nIn July 1970, the rock band Genesis had signed with Charisma Records and recorded their second album Trespass, but suffered a setback following the departure of guitarist Anthony Phillips. They decided that their drummer John Mayhew, though talented, was not of the high caliber they wanted, and placed an advert in the Melody Maker for a drummer \"sensitive to acoustic music\" and a 12-string acoustic guitarist.\n\nCollins recognised Charisma owner Tony Stratton Smith's name on it, and he and Caryl went for the auditions. The group, who had been a full-time working band for less than a year, consisted of school friends from Charterhouse School, a private boarding school: singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, and bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford. Collins and Caryl arrived early, so Collins took a swim in the pool at Gabriel's parents' house and memorised the pieces the drummers before him were playing.\n\nHe recalled: \"They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression was of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies, and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash.\" Gabriel, a former drummer, said he could tell just by the way Collins sat in front of the drum kit that he knew what he was doing, and was also impressed when Collins mentioned the session with George Harrison.\n\nOn 8 August 1970, Collins became their fourth drummer Genesis then took a two-week holiday, during which Collins earned money as an exterior decorator. Rutherford thought Caryl was not a good fit, and for over a month Genesis wrote songs, rehearsed, and toured as a four-piece. In January 1971, the band enlisted Steve Hackett.\n\n**1978–1984: Solo Debut with Face Value and Hello, I Must Be Going!**\n\nAfter Genesis finished touring in December 1978, the group went on hiatus after Collins went to Vancouver, Canada to try to save his failing marriage. The attempt failed, leaving his wife to return to England with their children while living apart. Collins returned to Old Croft, their home in Shalford, Surrey, and their divorce was finalised in 1981.\n\nBanks and Rutherford were recording their first solo albums during this time, so Collins rejoined Brand X for their album Product and its accompanying tour, played on John Martyn's album Grace and Danger, and started writing demos of his own at home. This was followed by Genesis resuming activity and recording and touring through 1980 with their album Duke.\n\nThe three members contributed two tracks each; Collins put forward \"Please Don't Ask\" and \"Misunderstanding\". Collins wrote and performed on \"Against All Odds\", the main theme for the romantic film of the same name, which demonstrated a more pop-orientated and commercially accessible sound than his previous work.\n\n**1984–1989: No Jacket Required and Commercial Ubiquity**\n\nCollins wrote and performed on \"Against All Odds\", the main theme for the romantic film of the same name, which demonstrated a more pop-orientated and commercially accessible sound than his previous work. Released in February 1984, it was the first single of his solo career to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it peaked at number two in the UK.\n\nCollins won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. The song earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, and he arranged his 1985 tour to accommodate the possibility of performing it at the awards ceremony. However, a note to Atlantic Records from show producer Larry Gelbart explaining a lack of invitation stated: \"Thank you for your note regarding Phil Cooper  [sic] I'm afraid the spots have already been filled\", and Collins watched actress and dancer Ann Reinking perform it.\n\n**1989–1996: ...But Seriously, Both Sides, and Leaving Genesis**\n\nIn August 1989, Collins appeared as a special guest for the Who on their 1989 tour for two shows, performing \"Fiddle About\" as Uncle Ernie and \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" from their rock opera Tommy. In the months surrounding his departure from Genesis, Collins formed the Phil Collins Big Band, seating himself on the drums.\n\nHe had wanted to undertake the project for some time and felt inspired from the Burning for Buddy project that drummer Neil Peart had put together. Having moved to Switzerland, an invitation to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival led to the band to come together, which featured Quincy Jones as conductor and Tony Bennett on vocals.\n\nThe group toured summer jazz festivals in July 1996 with a set of jazz renditions of Genesis and Collins' solo material. Their first date was at the Royal Albert Hall for a Prince's Trust concert with Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela in attendance. To learn his parts, Collins devised his own notation on sheets.\n\nThe band then went on hiatus until a US and European tour in the summer of 1998, which spawned the live album A Hot Night in Paris.\n\n**2006–2015: First Genesis Reunion, Going Back, and Retirement**\n\nCollins reunited with Banks and Rutherford and announced Turn It On Again: The Tour on 7 November 2006, nearly 40 years after the band first formed. The tour took place during summer 2007, and played in twelve countries across Europe, followed by a second leg in North America.\n\nDuring the tour Genesis performed at the Live Earth concert at Wembley Stadium, London. In 2007 they were honoured at the second annual VH1 Rock Honors, performing \"Turn It On Again\", \"No Son of Mine\" and \"Los Endos\" at the ceremony in Las Vegas.\n\nOn 22 May 2008, Collins received his sixth Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors when he was presented the International Achievement Award at a ceremony held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London.\n\n**2015–present: Out of Retirement, Not Dead Yet Tour, Second Genesis Reunion, and Possible New Music**\n\nIn May 2015, Collins signed a deal with Warner Music Group to have his solo albums remastered and reissued with previously unreleased material. In October of that year, he announced that he was no longer retired and had started plans to tour and make a new album.\n\nBy mid-2016, all eight of his albums were reissued with the artwork updated to display Collins as his older self; the exception being Going Back, which had a new cover. In 2019, the additional digital only releases Other Sides and Remixed Sides followed.\n\n**Drumming and Influence**\n\nIn his book on the \"legends\" who defined progressive rock drumming, American drummer Rich Lackowski wrote: \"Phil Collins's grooves in early Genesis recordings paved the way for many talented drummers to come. His ability to make the drums bark with musicality and to communicate so convincingly in odd time signatures left many a drummer tossing on the headphones and playing along to Phil's lead.\"\n\nIn 2014, readers of Rhythm voted Collins the fourth most influential progressive rock drummer for his work on the 1974 Genesis album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. In 2015, MusicRadar named Collins one of the six pioneers of progressive rock drumming.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nCollins is a left-handed drummer, and uses Gretsch drums, Noble & Cooley solid snare drums, Remo heads, Sabian cymbals, and he uses his signature Promark sticks. Past kits he used were made by Pearl and Premier.\n\n**Cameo Film and Television Appearances**\n\nCollins had cameo appearances in Steven Spielberg's Hook (1991) and the AIDS docudrama And the Band Played On (1993). He starred in Frauds, which competed for the Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHe supplied voices to two animated features: Amblin's Balto (1995) and Disney's The Jungle Book 2 (2003). A long-discussed but never completed project was a film titled The Three Bears; originally meant to star Collins, Danny DeVito, and Bob Hoskins.\n\nCollins's music is featured in the satirical black comedy film American Psycho, with psychotic lead character Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) portrayed as an obsessive fan who reads deep meaning into his work, especially with Genesis, while describing his solo music as \"...more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way.\"\n\nBateman delivers a monologue praising Collins and Genesis during a sequence in which he engages the services of two prostitutes while playing \"In Too Deep\" and \"Sussudio\". Collins told the New Musical Express: \"I don't think him being a psychopath and liking my music is linked – my music was just omnipresent in that era.\"\n\n**Critical and Public Perceptions**\n\nAccording to a 2000 BBC biography of Collins, \"critics sneer at him\" and \"bad publicity also caused problems\", which \"damaged his public profile\". Rock historian Martin C Strong wrote that Collins \"truly polarised opinion from the start, his ubiquitous smugness and increasingly sterile pop making him a favourite target for critics\".\n\nAccording to Guardian writer Paul Lester, Collins would \"regularly\" call music journalists to take issue with negative reviews. Over time, he came to be personally disliked; in 2009, journalist Mark Lawson told how Collins's media profile had shifted from \"pop's Mr Nice guy, patron saint of ordinary blokes\", to someone accused of \"blandness, tax exile and ending a marriage by sending a fax\".\n\nCollins has rejected accusations of tax avoidance, and despite confirming that some of the divorce-related correspondence between him and second wife, Jill Tavelman, was by fax (a message from Collins regarding access to their daughter was reproduced for the front cover of The Sun in 1993), he states that he did not terminate the marriage in that fashion.\n\nNevertheless, the British media has often repeated the fax claim. Collins has been the victim of scathing remarks in regard to his alleged right-wing political leanings. Caroline Sullivan, a music critic of The Guardian, referred to his cumulative negative publicity in her 2007 article \"I wish I'd never heard of Phil Collins\", writing that it was difficult for her to hear his work \"without being riven by distaste for the man himself\".\n\n**Praise**\n\nPaul Lester of The Guardian wrote in 2013 that Collins is one of several pop acts that \"used to be a joke\" but are \"now being hailed as gods\". Collins has become an important figure in US urban music, influencing artists such as Kanye West, Alicia Keys, and Beyoncé. His songs have been sampled by various hip-hop and contemporary R&B acts, and performers including Lil' Kim, Kelis, and Wu-Tang Clan co-founder Ol' Dirty Bastard covered his work on the 2001 tribute album Urban Renewal.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nCollins has divorced three times. From 1975 to 1980, he was married to Canadian-born Andrea Bertorelli. They met as 11-year-old students in a London drama class and reconnected in 1974 when Genesis performed in Vancouver. They married in England in 1975 when both were 24, after which Collins legally adopted Bertorelli's daughter Joely (b 1972), who became an actress and film producer.\n\nThey also had a son, Simon Collins (b 1976), who is the former vocalist and drummer of the progressive rock band Sound of Contact. In 2016, Bertorelli took legal action against Collins pertaining to his account of their relationship in his autobiography.\n\n**Wealth**\n\nIn 2012, Collins was estimated to be the second-wealthiest drummer in the world, surpassed only by Ringo Starr. Collins was estimated to have a fortune of £120 million in the Sunday Times Rich List of 2018, making him one of the 25 wealthiest people in the British music industry.\n\n**Court Case**\n\nOn 29 March 2000, Collins launched a case against two former musicians from his band to recoup £500,000 in royalties that were overpaid. Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis claimed their contract entitled them to 0.5 per cent of the royalties from Serious Hits.. Live!, a live album recorded during Collins's Seriously, Live! World Tour in 1990.\n\nThey claimed they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded that the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved. On 19 April 2000, the High Court in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins.\n\n**Health**\n\nIn 2000, Collins developed sudden hearing loss in his left ear following a recording session in Los Angeles. He consulted three doctors, who reportedly told him that there was nothing they could do and that the chance of a full recovery was slim.\n\nTwo years later, he had recovered most of his hearing. Collins later found that it was caused by a viral infection, and that it was resolved after treatment.\n\n**Honorary Degrees**\n\nCollins has received several honorary degrees in recognition of his work in music and his personal interests. In 1987, he received an honorary doctorate of fine arts at Fairleigh Dickinson University.\n\nIn 1991, he received an honorary doctorate of music at the Berklee College of Music. On 12 May 2012, he received an honorary doctorate of history at the McMurry University in Abilene, Texas, for his research and collection of Texas Revolution artefacts and documents.\n\n**Politics**\n\nCollins has often been mentioned erroneously in the British media as being a supporter of the Conservative Party and a critic of the Labour Party. This derives from the famous article in The Sun, printed on the day of the 1992 UK general election, titled \"If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights\", which stated that Collins was among several celebrities who were planning to leave Britain in the event of a Labour victory.\n\n**Other Interests**\n\nCollins has a long-standing interest in the Alamo. He has collected hundreds of artefacts related to the famous 1836 battle in San Antonio, Texas, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and has spoken at related events.\n\nHis passion for the Battle of the Alamo has also led him to write the book The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector's Journey, published in 2012. A short film was released in 2013 called Phil Collins and the Wild Frontier which captures Collins on a book tour in June 2012.\n\nOn 26 June 2014, a press conference was held from the Alamo, where Collins spoke, announcing that he was donating his entire collection to the Alamo via the State of Texas. On 11 March 2015, in honour of his donation, Collins was named an honorary Texan by the state legislature.\n\n**Charity Work**\n\nCollins has performed at the Secret Policeman's Ball, a benefit show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese on behalf of Amnesty International. He made his first appearance at the 1981 show held in London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and he subsequently became an activist.\n\nCollins was appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in the 1994 Birthday Honours, in recognition of his work on behalf of The Prince's Trust, a leading UK youth charity founded by King Charles III (then-Prince of Wales) which provides training, personal development, business start up support, mentoring, and advice.\n\nSince appearing at the first Prince's Trust's rock concert in 1982 which included a performance as part of singer Kate Bush's backing band, Collins has played at the event numerous times since, most recently at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nCollins has won numerous awards and nominations for his work in music and other fields. Some of his notable awards include:\n\n* 3 Grammy Awards\n* 6 Ivor Novello Awards\n* 2 American Music Awards\n* 1 BRIT Award\n* 1 MTV Video Music Award\n* 1 Billboard Music Award\n\nCollins has also been nominated for numerous other awards, including Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Phil_Collins\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nPhilip David Charles Collins was born on 30 January 1951 at Putney Hospital in Wandsworth, south-west London [17] [18] His father, Greville Philip Austin Collins (1907–1972), was an insurance agent for London Assurance; his mother, Winifred June Collins (née Strange, 1913–2011), worked in a toy shop, and later as a booking agent at the Barbara Speake Stage School – an independent performing arts school in East Acton [19] [20] Collins is the youngest of three children: his sister Carole competed as a professional ice skater and followed her mother's footsteps as a theatrical agent, and his brother Clive was a noted cartoonist [20] [21] The family moved twice by the time Collins had reached two; they settled at 453 Hanworth Road in Hounslow, Middlesex [22]\n\n\nCareer\nCollins quit school at fourteen to become a full-time pupil at Barbara Speake He had an uncredited part as an extra in the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night (1964), where he is amongst the screaming teenagers during the television concert sequence [37] Later in 1964, Collins was cast as the Artful Dodger in two West End runs of the musical Oliver! [38] He was paid £15 a week, and called the role \"the best part for a kid in all London\" [39] [20] His days as the Dodger were numbered when his voice broke during a performance and had to speak his lines for the rest of the show [21] Collins starred in Calamity the Cow (1967), a film produced by the Children's Film Foundation After a falling out with the director, Collins decided to quit acting to pursue music [40] He was to appear in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) as one of the children who storm the castle, but his scene was cut [41] Collins auditioned for the role of Romeo in Romeo and Juliet (1968), but the role went to Leonard Whiting [42] In 1967, he travelled the UK teaching people the \"crunch\" dance made popular by a Smith's crisps advertising campaign [35]\n\n\n1963–1970: Early acting roles and bands\nCollins quit school at fourteen to become a full-time pupil at Barbara Speake He had an uncredited part as an extra in the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night (1964), where he is amongst the screaming teenagers during the television concert sequence [37] Later in 1964, Collins was cast as the Artful Dodger in two West End runs of the musical Oliver!

Collins put forward \"Please Don't Ask\" and \"Misunderstanding\" [79]\n\n\n1984–1989: No Jacket Required and commercial ubiquity\nCollins wrote and performed on \"Against All Odds\", the main theme for the romantic film of the same name, which demonstrated a more pop-orientated and commercially accessible sound than his previous work Released in February 1984, it was the first single of his solo career to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; it peaked at number two in the UK Collins won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male [72] The song earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song, and he arranged his 1985 tour to accommodate the possibility of performing it at the awards ceremony However, a note to Atlantic Records from show producer Larry Gelbart explaining a lack of invitation stated: \"Thank you for your note regarding Phil Cooper  [sic] I'm afraid the spots have already been filled\", and Collins watched actress and dancer Ann Reinking perform it [91] The Los Angeles Times said: \"Reinking did an incredible job of totally destroying a beautiful song.\" [92] Collins would introduce it at subsequent concerts by saying: \"I'm sorry Miss Ann Reinking couldn't be here tonight; I guess I just have to sing my own song.\" [93]\n\n\n1989–1996: ...But Seriously, Both Sides, and leaving Genesis\nIn August 1989, Collins appeared as a special guest for the Who on their 1989 tour for two shows, performing \"Fiddle About\" as Uncle Ernie and \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" from their rock opera Tommy (1969) [114]\n\n\n1996–2006: Phil Collins Big Band, Dance into the Light, Disney work, and Testify\nIn the months surrounding his departure from Genesis, Collins formed the Phil Collins Big Band, seating himself on the drums He had wanted to undertake the project for some time and felt inspired from the Burning for Buddy project that drummer Neil Peart had put together Having moved to Switzerland, an invitation to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival led to the band to come together, which featured Quincy Jones as conductor and Tony Bennett on vocals [129] The group toured summer jazz festivals in July 1996 with a set of jazz renditions of Genesis and Collins' solo material Their first date was at the Royal Albert Hall for a Prince's Trust concert with Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela in attendance To learn his parts, Collins devised his own notation on sheets [129] The band then went on hiatus until a US and European tour in the summer of 1998, which spawned the live album A Hot Night in Paris.\n\n\n2006–2015: First Genesis reunion, Going Back, and retirement\nCollins reunited with Banks and Rutherford and announced Turn It On Again: The Tour on 7 November 2006, nearly 40 years after the band first formed The tour took place during summer 2007, and played in twelve countries across Europe, followed by a second leg in North America During the tour Genesis performed at the Live Earth concert at Wembley Stadium, London [144] In 2007 they were honoured at the second annual VH1 Rock Honors, performing \"Turn It On Again\", \"No Son of Mine\" and \"Los Endos\" at the ceremony in Las Vegas [145] On 22 May 2008, Collins received his sixth Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors when he was presented the International Achievement Award at a ceremony held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London [146]\n\n\n2015–present: Out of retirement, Not Dead Yet Tour, second Genesis reunion, and possible new music\nIn May 2015, Collins signed a deal with Warner Music Group to have his solo albums remastered and reissued with previously unreleased material [168] In October of that year, he announced that he was no longer retired and had started plans to tour and make a new album [169] [170] By mid-2016, all eight of his albums were reissued with the artwork updated to display Collins as his older self; the exception being Going Back, which had a new cover [171] In 2019, the additional digital only releases Other Sides and Remixed Sides followed [172]\n\n\nDrumming and influence\nIn his book on the \"legends\" who defined progressive rock drumming, American drummer Rich Lackowski wrote: \"Phil Collins's grooves in early Genesis recordings paved the way for many talented drummers to come His ability to make the drums bark with musicality and to communicate so convincingly in odd time signatures left many a drummer tossing on the headphones and playing along to Phil's lead.\" [183] In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted Collins the fourth most influential progressive rock drummer for his work on the 1974 Genesis album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway [184] In 2015, MusicRadar named Collins one of the six pioneers of progressive rock drumming [185] In 2005, Planet Rock listeners voted Collins the fifth greatest rock drummer in history [186] Collins was ranked tenth in \"The Greatest Drummers of All Time\" list by Gigwise and number nine in a list of \"The 20 greatest drummers of the last 25 years\" by MusicRadar in 2010 [187] [188] In 1987, Collins looked back at his fast playing in Brand X and early Genesis: \"I actually can't play like that anymore\" [189]\n\n\nEquipment\nCollins is a left-handed drummer, and uses Gretsch drums, Noble & Cooley solid snare drums, Remo heads, Sabian cymbals and he uses his signature Promark sticks Past kits he used were made by Pearl and Premier [203]\n\n\nCameo film and television appearances\nCollins had cameo appearances in Steven Spielberg's Hook (1991) and the AIDS docudrama And the Band Played On (1993) He starred in Frauds, which competed for the Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival [207] He supplied voices to two animated features: Amblin's Balto (1995) and Disney's The Jungle Book 2 (2003) A long-discussed but never completed project was a film titled The Three Bears; originally meant to star Collins, Danny DeVito, and Bob Hoskins He often mentioned the film, though an appropriate script never materialised [208] Collins's music is featured in the satirical black comedy film American Psycho, with psychotic lead character Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) portrayed as an obsessive fan who reads deep meaning into his work, especially with Genesis, while describing his solo music as \"...more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way.\" Bateman delivers a monologue praising Collins and Genesis during a sequence in which he engages the services of two prostitutes while playing \"In Too Deep\" and \"Sussudio\" Collins told the New Musical Express: \"I don't think him being a psychopath and liking my music is linked – my music was just omnipresent in that era.\" [209]\n\n\nCritical and public perceptions\nAccording to a 2000 BBC biography of Collins, \"critics sneer at him\" and \"bad publicity also caused problems\", which \"damaged his public profile\" [220] Rock historian Martin C Strong wrote that Collins \"truly polarised opinion from the start, his ubiquitous smugness and increasingly sterile pop making him a favourite target for critics\" [221] According to Guardian writer Paul Lester, Collins would \"regularly\" call music journalists to take issue with negative reviews [222] Over time, he came to be personally disliked; [223] in 2009, journalist Mark Lawson told how Collins's media profile had shifted from \"pop's Mr Nice guy, patron saint of ordinary blokes\", to someone accused of \"blandness, tax exile and ending a marriage by sending a fax\" [224] Collins has rejected accusations of tax avoidance, and despite confirming that some of the divorce-related correspondence between him and second wife, Jill Tavelman, was by fax (a message from Collins regarding access to their daughter was reproduced for the front cover of The Sun in 1993), [225] he states that he did not terminate the marriage in that fashion [224] Nevertheless, the British media has often repeated the fax claim [220] [226] [227] [228] Collins has been the victim of scathing remarks in regard to his alleged right-wing political leanings Caroline Sullivan, a music critic of The Guardian, referred to his cumulative negative publicity in her 2007 article \"I wish I'd never heard of Phil Collins\", writing that it was difficult for her to hear his work \"without being riven by distaste for the man himself\" [226]\n\n\nCriticism\nAccording to a 2000 BBC biography of Collins, \"critics sneer at him\" and \"bad publicity also caused problems\", which \"damaged his public profile\" [220] Rock historian Martin C Strong wrote that Collins \"truly polarised opinion from the start, his ubiquitous smugness and increasingly sterile pop making him a favourite target for critics\" [221] According to Guardian writer Paul Lester, Collins would \"regularly\" call music journalists to take issue with negative reviews [222] Over time, he came to be personally disliked;

Live!, a live album recorded during Collins's Seriously, Live! World Tour in 1990 They claimed they were an integral part of the whole album, but Collins responded that the two should only receive royalties from the five tracks in which they were involved [284] On 19 April 2000, the High Court in London ruled that the two musicians would receive no more royalty money from Phil Collins The amount that Collins was seeking was halved, and Satterfield and Davis (who originally brought the suit forward in California) would not have to repay any of it The judge agreed with Collins's argument that Satterfield and Davis should have been paid for only the five tracks on which they performed, including the hit \"Sussudio\" [285]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2000, Collins developed sudden hearing loss in his left ear following a recording session in Los Angeles He consulted three doctors, who reportedly told him that there was nothing they could do and that the chance of a full recovery was slim Two years later, he had recovered most of his hearing [286] Collins later found that it was caused by a viral infection, and that it was resolved after treatment [135]\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nCollins has received several honorary degrees in recognition of his work in music and his personal interests In 1987, he received an honorary doctorate of fine arts at Fairleigh Dickinson University [298] In 1991, he received an honorary doctorate of music at the Berklee College of Music [299] On 12 May 2012, he received an honorary doctorate of history at the McMurry University in Abilene, Texas, [300] for his research and collection of Texas Revolution artefacts and documents (see other interests section).\n\n\nPolitics\nCollins has often been mentioned erroneously in the British media as being a supporter of the Conservative Party and a critic of the Labour Party [226] [301] This derives from the famous article in The Sun, printed on the day of the 1992 UK general election, titled \"If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights\", which stated that Collins was among several celebrities who were planning to leave Britain in the event of a Labour victory [302] [303]\n\n\nOther interests\nCollins has a long-standing interest in the Alamo He has collected hundreds of artefacts related to the famous 1836 battle in San Antonio, Texas, narrated a light and sound show about the Alamo, and has spoken at related events [315] His passion for the Battle of the Alamo has also led him to write the book The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector's Journey, published in 2012 [316] A short film was released in 2013 called Phil Collins and the Wild Frontier which captures Collins on a book tour in June 2012 [317] On 26 June 2014, a press conference was held from the Alamo, where Collins spoke, announcing that he was donating his entire collection to the Alamo via the State of Texas [318] On 11 March 2015, in honour of his donation, Collins was named an honorary Texan by the state legislature [319]\n\n\nCharity work\nCollins has performed at the Secret Policeman's Ball, a benefit show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese on behalf of Amnesty International He made his first appearance at the 1981 show held in London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and he subsequently became an activist [323] Collins was appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in the 1994 Birthday Honours, in recognition of his work on behalf of The Prince's Trust, a leading UK youth charity founded by King Charles III (then-Prince of Wales) which provides training, personal development, business start up support, mentoring, and advice [324] Since appearing at the first Prince's Trust's rock concert in 1982 which included a performance as part of singer Kate Bush's backing band, Collins has played at the event numerous times since, most recently at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010 [325] [326]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nStudio albums\n\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n\n\nConcert tours\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Arch", "content": "\nBasic concepts\nA true arch is a load-bearing arc with elements held together by compression [7] In much of the world introduction of the true arch was a result of European influence [2] The term false arch has few meanings It is usually used to designate an arch that has no structural purpose, like a proscenium arch in theaters used to frame the performance for the spectators, but is also applied to corbelled and triangular arches that are not based on compression [8] [9]\n\n\nTerminology\nA true arch is a load-bearing arc with elements held together by compression [7] In much of the world introduction of the true arch was a result of European influence [2] The term false arch has few meanings It is usually used to designate an arch that has no structural purpose, like a proscenium arch in theaters used to frame the performance for the spectators, but is also applied to corbelled and triangular arches that are not based on compression [8] [9]\n\n\nArch action\nA true arch, due to its rise, resolves the vertical loads into horizontal and vertical reactions at the ends, a so called arch action The vertical load produces a positive bending moment in the arch, while the inward-directed horizontal reaction from the spandrel/abutment provides a counterbalancing negative moment As a result, the bending moment in any segment of the arch is much smaller than in a beam with the equivalent load and span [22] The diagram on the right shows the difference between a loaded arch and a beam Elements of the arch are mostly subject to compression (A), while in the beam a bending moment is present, with compression at the top and tension at the bottom (B).\n\n\nFunicular shapes\nWhen evaluated from the perspective of an amount of material required to support a given load, the best solid structures are compression-only; with the flexible materials, the same is true for tension-only designs There is a fundamental symmetry in nature between solid compression-only and flexible tension-only arrangements, noticed by Robert Hooke in 1676: \"As hangs the flexible line, so but inverted will stand the rigid arch\", thus the study (and terminology) of arch shapes is inextricably linked to the study of hanging chains, the corresponding curves or polygons are called funicular Just like the shape of a hanging chain will vary depending on the weights attached to it, the shape of an ideal (compression-only) arch will depend on the distribution of the load  [23]\n\n\nClassifications\nThere are multiple ways to classify an arch: [24]\n\n\nArrangements\nA sequence of arches can be grouped together forming an arcade Romans perfected this form, as shown, for example, by arched structures of Pont du Gard [28] In the interior of hall churches, arcades of separating arches were used to separate the nave of a church from the side aisle, [29] or two adjacent side aisles [30]\n\n\nStructural\nStructurally, relieving arches (often blind or containing) can be used to take off load from some portions of the building (for example, to allow use of thinner exterior walls with larger window openings, or, as in the Roman Pantheon, to redirect the weight of the upper structures to particular strong points) [33] Transverse arches, introduced in Carolingian architecture, are placed across the nave to compartmentalize (together with longitudinal separating arches) the internal space into bays and support vaults [36] A diaphragm arch similarly goes in the transverse direction, but carries a section of wall on top It is used to support or divide sections of the high roof [37] Strainer arches were built as an afterthought to prevent two adjacent supports from imploding due to miscalculation Frequently they were made very decorative, with one of the best examples provided by the Wells Cathedral  Strainer arches can be \"inverted\" (upside-down) while remaining structural [38] [39]  When used across railway cuttings to prevent collapse of the walls, strainer arches may be referred to as flying arches [40] [41] A counter-arch is built adjacent to another arch to oppose its horizontal action or help to stabilize it, for example, when constructing a flying buttress [42]\n\n\nShapes\nThe large variety of arch shapes (left) can mostly be classified into three broad categories: rounded, pointed, and parabolic [43]\n\n\nRounded\n\"Round\" semicircular arches were commonly used for ancient arches that were constructed of heavy masonry, [44] and were relied heavily on by the Roman builders since the 4th century BC It is considered to be the most common arch form, [45] characteristic for Roman, Romanesque, and Renaissance architecture [25]\n\n\nPointed\nA pointed arch consists of two (\"two-centred arch\" [51]) or more circle segments culminating in a point at the top It originated in the Islamic architecture, arrived in Europe in the second half of the 11th century (Cluny Abbey) [52] and later became prominent in the Gothic architecture [53] The advantages of a pointed arch over a semicircular one are flexible ratio of span to rise [54] and lower horizontal reaction at the base This innovation allowed for taller and more closely spaced openings, which are typical of Gothic architecture [55] [56] Equilateral arch is the most common form of the pointed arch, with the centers of two circles forming the intrados coinciding with the springing points of the opposite segment Together with the apex point, they form a equilateral triangle, thus the name [57] If the centers of circles are farther apart, the arch becomes a narrower and sharper lancet arch that appeared in France in the Early Gothic architecture (Saint-Denis Abbey) and became prominent in England in the late 12th and early 13th centuries (Salisbury Cathedral) [58] If the centers are closer to another, the result is a wider blunt arch.\n\n\nParabolic\nThe popularity of the arches using segments of a circle is due to simplicity of layout and construction, [71] not their structural properties Consequently, the architects historically used a variety of other curves in their designs: elliptical curves, hyperbolic cosine curves (including catenary), and parabolic curves There are two reasons behind the selection of these curves: [72]\n\n\nOther\nUnlike regular arches, the flat arch (also known as jack arch, lintel arch, straight arch, plate-bande [82])  is not curved Instead, the arch is flat in profile and can be used under the same circumstances as lintel However, lintels are subject to bending stress, while the flat arches are true arches, composed of irregular voussoir shapes (the keystone is the only one of the symmetric  wedge shape), [83] and that efficiently uses the compressive strength of the masonry in the same manner as a curved arch and thus requires a mass of masonry on both sides to absorb the considerable lateral thrust Used in the Roman architecture to imitate the Greek lintels, Islamic architecture, European medieval and Renaissance architecture The flat arch is still being used as a decorative pattern, primarily at the top of window openings [83]\n\n\nFalse arches\nThe corbel (also corbelled) arch, made of two corbels meeting in the middle of the span, is a true arch in a sense of being able to carry a load, but it is false in a structural sense, as its components are subject to bending stress The typical profile is not curved, but has triangular shape Invented prior to the semicircular arch, the corbel arch was used already in the Egyptian and Mycenaean architecture in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC [84]\n\n\nVariations\nFew transformations can be applied to arch shapes.\n\n\nHinged arches\nThe practical arch bridges are built either as a fixed arch, a two-hinged arch, or a three-hinged arch [100] \nThe fixed arch is most often used in reinforced concrete bridges and tunnels, which have short spans Because it is subject to additional internal stress from thermal expansion and contraction, this kind of arch is statically indeterminate (the internal state is impossible to determine based on the external forces alone) [43]\n\n\nHistory\nThe arch became popular in the Roman times and mostly spread alongside the European influence, although it was known and occasionally used much earlier Many ancient architectures avoided the use of arches, including the Viking and Hindu ones [2]\n\n\nBronze Age: ancient Near East\nTrue arches, as opposed to corbel arches, were known by a number of civilizations in the ancient Near East including the Levant, but their use was infrequent and mostly confined to underground structures, such as drains where the problem of lateral thrust is greatly diminished [102]\nAn example of the latter would be the Nippur arch, built before 3800 BC, [103] and dated by  H V Hilprecht (1859–1925) to even before 4000 BC [104] Rare exceptions are an arched mudbrick home doorway dated to c. 2000 BC from Tell Taya in Iraq [105] and two Bronze Age arched Canaanite city gates, one at Ashkelon (dated to c. 1850 BC), [106] and one at Tel Dan (dated to c. 1750 BC), both in modern-day Israel [107] [108] An Elamite tomb dated 1500 BC from Haft Teppe contains a parabolic vault which is considered one of the earliest evidences of arches in Iran.\n\n\nClassical Persia and Greece\nThe Assyrians, also apparently under the Egyptian influence, adopted the true arch (with a slightly pointed profile) early in the 8th century [109] In ancient Persia, the Achaemenid Empire (550 BC–330 BC) built small barrel vaults (essentially a series of arches built together to form a hall) known as iwan, which became massive, monumental structures during the later Parthian Empire (247 BC–AD 224) [110] [111] [112] This architectural tradition was continued by the Sasanian Empire (224–651), which built the Taq Kasra at Ctesiphon in the 6th century AD, the largest free-standing vault until modern times [113]\n\n\nAncient Rome\nThe ancient Romans learned the semicircular arch from the Etruscans (both cultures apparently adopted the design in the 4th century BC [28]), refined it and were the first builders in Europe to tap its full potential for above ground buildings:\n\n\nAncient China\nAncient architecture of China (and Japan) used mostly timber-framed construction and trabeated system [5] Arches were little-used, although there are few arch bridges known from literature and one artistic depiction in stone-carved relief [119] [120] [121] Since the only surviving artefacts of architecture from the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) are rammed earth defensive walls and towers, ceramic roof tiles from no longer existent wooden buildings, [122] [123] [124] stone gate towers, [125] [126] and underground brick tombs, the known vaults, domes, and archways were built with the support of the earth and were not free-standing [127] [128]\n\n\nIslamic\nIslamic architects adopted the Roman arches, but had quickly shown their resourcefulness: by the 8th century the simple semicircular arch was almost entirely replaced with fancier shapes, few fine examples of the former in the Umayyad architecture notwithstanding (cf the Great Mosque of Damascus, 706–715 CE) The first pointed arches appear already at the end of the 7th century AD (Al-Aqsa Mosque, Palace of Ukhaidhir, cisterns at the White Mosque of Ramle [131] [132]) Their variations spread fast and wide: Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo (876-879 AD), Nizamiyya Madrasa at Khar Gerd (now Iran, 11th century), Kongo Mosque in Diani Beach (Kenya, 16th century) [70] [132]\n\n\nWestern Europe\nThe collapse of the Western Roman Empire left the church as the only client of major construction; with all pre-Romanesque architectural styles borrowing from Roman construction with its semicircular arch Due to the decline in the construction quality, the walls were thicker, and the arches thus heavier, than their Roman prototypes Eventually the architects started to use the depth of the arches for decoration, turning the deep opening into an arch order (or rebated arch, a sequence of progressively smaller concentric arches, each inset with a rebate) [135]\n\n\nIndia\nThe history of arch in India is very long (some arches were apparently found in excavations of Kosambi, 2nd millennium BC However, the continuous history begins with rock-cut arches in the Lomas Rishi cave (3rd century BC) [70] Vaulted roof of an early Harappan burial chamber has been noted at Rakhigarhi [136] S.R Rao reports vaulted roof of a small chamber in a house from Lothal [137] Barrel vaults were also used in the Late Harappan Cemetery H culture dated 1900 BC-1300 BC which formed the roof of the metal working furnace, the discovery was made by Vats in 1940 during excavation at Harappa [138] [139] [140]\n\n\nPre-Columbian America\nMayan architecture utilized the corbel arches The other Mesoamerican cultures used only the flat roofs with no arches whatsoever, [143] although some researchers had suggested that both Maya and Aztec architects understood the concept of a true arch [144] [145]\n\n\nRevival of the trabeated system\nThe 19th-century introduction of the wrought iron (and later steel) into construction changed the role of the arch Due to the high tensile strength of new materials, relatively long lintels became possible, as was demonstrated  by the tubular Britannia Bridge (Robert Stephenson, 1846-1850) A fervent proponent of the trabeated system, Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson, whose preference for lintels was originally based on aesthetic criteria, observed that the spans of this bridge are longer than that of any arch ever built, thus \"the simple, unsophisticated stone lintel contains in its structure all the scientific appliances  [...] used in the great tubular bridge  [...] Stonehenge is more scientifically constructed than York Minster.\" [146] Use of arches in bridge construction continued (the Britannia Bridge was rebuilt in 1972 as a truss arch bridge), yet the steel frames and reinforced concrete frames mostly replaced the arches as the load-bearing elements in buildings.\n\n\nConstruction\nAs a pure compression form, the utility of the arch is due to many building materials, including stone and unreinforced concrete, being strong under compression, but brittle when tensile stress is applied to them [147]\n\n\nMasonry\nThe voussoirs can be wedge-shaped or have a form of a rectangular cuboid, in the latter case the wedge-like shape is provided by the mortar [89]\n\n\nReinforced concrete\nIn reinforced concrete construction, the principle of the arch is used so as to benefit from the concrete's strength in resisting compressive stress Where any other form of stress is raised, such as tensile or torsional stress, it has to be resisted by carefully placed reinforcement rods or fibres [148]\n\n\nArchitectural styles\nThe type of arches (or absence of them) is one of the most prominent characteristics of an architectural style For example, when Heinrich Hübsch, in the 19th century, tried to classify the architectural style, his \"primary elements\" were roof and supports, with the top-level basic types: trabeated (no arches) and arcuated (arch-based) His next division for the arcuated styles was based on the use of round and pointed arch shapes [149]\n\n\nCultural references\nThe steady horizontal push of an arch against the abutments gave rise to a saying \"the arch never sleeps\", attributed to many sources, from Hindu [150] to Arabs [25] This adage stresses that the arch carries \"a seed of death\" for itself and the structure containing it, a statement that can be made upon observation of the Roman ruins [25] The plot of The Nebuly Coat by J Meade Falkner, inspired by a collapse of a tower at the Chichester Cathedral plays with the idea while dealing with the slow disintegration of a church building [150] Saoud [151] explains the proverb by chain-like self-balancing of the horizontal and vertical forces in the arch and its \"universal adaptability\" [152]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal

opening or supports a weight. The arch has been a vital component in the development of various architectural styles and has played a crucial role in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures throughout history.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe arch has been an essential element in architecture for thousands of years, with its origins dating back to ancient civilizations. The earliest known arches were used in the construction of bridges, aqueducts, and buildings in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. The Roman Empire popularized the use of arches in architecture, and they have since become a ubiquitous feature in various architectural styles, from Gothic to Islamic and modern.\n\n**Basic Concepts**\n\nA true arch is a load-bearing arc with elements held together by compression. In much of the world, the introduction of the true arch was a result of European influence. The term \"false arch\" has few meanings and is usually used to designate an arch that has no structural purpose, such as a proscenium arch in theaters, or to corbelled and triangular arches that are not based on compression.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nA true arch is a load-bearing arc with elements held together by compression. In much of the world, the introduction of the true arch was a result of European influence. The term \"false arch\" has few meanings and is usually used to designate an arch that has no structural purpose, such as a proscenium arch in theaters, or to corbelled and triangular arches that are not based on compression.\n\n**Arch Action**\n\nA true arch resolves the vertical loads into horizontal and vertical reactions at the ends, known as arch action. The vertical load produces a positive bending moment in the arch, while the inward-directed horizontal reaction from the spandrel/abutment provides a counterbalancing negative moment. As a result, the bending moment in any segment of the arch is much smaller than in a beam with the equivalent load and span. The diagram on the right shows the difference between a loaded arch and a beam.\n\n**Funicular Shapes**\n\nWhen evaluated from the perspective of an amount of material required to support a given load, the best solid structures are compression-only; with the flexible materials, the same is true for tension-only designs. There is a fundamental symmetry in nature between solid compression-only and flexible tension-only arrangements, noticed by Robert Hooke in 1676: \"As hangs the flexible line, so but inverted will stand the rigid arch.\" Thus, the study (and terminology) of arch shapes is inextricably linked to the study of hanging chains, the corresponding curves or polygons are called funicular. Just like the shape of a hanging chain will vary depending on the weights attached to it, the shape of an ideal (compression-only) arch will depend on the distribution of the load.\n\n**Classifications**\n\nThere are multiple ways to classify an arch:\n\n### Arrangements\n\nA sequence of arches can be grouped together forming an arcade. Romans perfected this form, as shown, for example, by arched structures of Pont du Gard. In the interior of hall churches, arcades of separating arches were used to separate the nave of a church from the side aisle, or two adjacent side aisles.\n\n### Structural\n\nStructurally, relieving arches (often blind or containing) can be used to take off load from some portions of the building (for example, to allow use of thinner exterior walls with larger window openings, or, as in the Roman Pantheon, to redirect the weight of the upper structures to particular strong points). Transverse arches, introduced in Carolingian architecture, are placed across the nave to compartmentalize (together with longitudinal separating arches) the internal space into bays and support vaults. A diaphragm arch similarly goes in the transverse direction, but carries a section of wall on top, used to support or divide sections of the high roof. Strainer arches were built as an afterthought to prevent two adjacent supports from imploding due to miscalculation. Frequently they were made very decorative, with one of the best examples provided by the Wells Cathedral. Strainer arches can be \"inverted\" (upside-down) while remaining structural. When used across railway cuttings to prevent collapse of the walls, strainer arches may be referred to as flying arches. A counter-arch is built adjacent to another arch to oppose its horizontal action or help to stabilize it, for example, when constructing a flying buttress.\n\n### Shapes\n\nThe large variety of arch shapes can mostly be classified into three broad categories: rounded, pointed, and parabolic.\n\n### Rounded\n\n\"Round\" semicircular arches were commonly used for ancient arches that were constructed of heavy masonry, and were relied heavily on by the Roman builders since the 4th century BC. It is considered to be the most common arch form, characteristic for Roman, Romanesque, and Renaissance architecture.\n\n### Pointed\n\nA pointed arch consists of two (\"two-centred arch\") or more circle segments culminating in a point at the top. It originated in the Islamic architecture, arrived in Europe in the second half of the 11th century (Cluny Abbey), and later became prominent in the Gothic architecture. The advantages of a pointed arch over a semicircular one are flexible ratio of span to rise and lower horizontal reaction at the base. This innovation allowed for taller and more closely spaced openings, which are typical of Gothic architecture.\n\n### Parabolic\n\nThe popularity of the arches using segments of a circle is due to simplicity of layout and construction, not their structural properties. Consequently, the architects historically used a variety of other curves in their designs: elliptical curves, hyperbolic cosine curves (including catenary), and parabolic curves.\n\n**Other**\n\nUnlike regular arches, the flat arch (also known as jack arch, lintel arch, straight arch, plate-bande) is not curved. Instead, the arch is flat in profile and can be used under the same circumstances as lintel. However, lintels are subject to bending stress, while the flat arches are true arches, composed of irregular voussoir shapes (the keystone is the only one of the symmetric wedge shape), and that efficiently uses the compressive strength of the masonry in the same manner as a curved arch and thus requires a mass of masonry on both sides to absorb the considerable lateral thrust. Used in the Roman architecture to imitate the Greek lintels, Islamic architecture, European medieval and Renaissance architecture. The flat arch is still being used as a decorative pattern, primarily at the top of window openings.\n\n**False Arches**\n\nThe corbel (also corbelled) arch, made of two corbels meeting in the middle of the span, is a true arch in a sense of being able to carry a load, but it is false in a structural sense, as its components are subject to bending stress. The typical profile is not curved, but has triangular shape. Invented prior to the semicircular arch, the corbel arch was used already in the Egyptian and Mycenaean architecture in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC.\n\n**Variations**\n\nFew transformations can be applied to arch shapes. The practical arch bridges are built either as a fixed arch, a two-hinged arch, or a three-hinged arch. The fixed arch is most often used in reinforced concrete bridges and tunnels, which have short spans. Because it is subject to additional internal stress from thermal expansion and contraction, this kind of arch is statically indeterminate (the internal state is impossible to determine based on the external forces alone).\n\n**History**\n\nThe arch became popular in the Roman times and mostly spread alongside the European influence, although it was known and occasionally used much earlier.

quality, the walls were thicker, and the arches thus heavier, than their Roman prototypes Eventually the architects started to use the depth of the arches for decoration, turning the deep opening into an arch order (or rebated arch, a sequence of progressively smaller concentric arches, each inset with a rebate) [135]\n\n\nIndia\nThe history of arch in India is very long (some arches were apparently found in excavations of Kosambi, 2nd millennium BC However, the continuous history begins with rock-cut arches in the Lomas Rishi cave (3rd century BC) [70] Vaulted roof of an early Harappan burial chamber has been noted at Rakhigarhi [136] S.R Rao reports vaulted roof of a small chamber in a house from Lothal [137] Barrel vaults were also used in the Late Harappan Cemetery H culture dated 1900 BC-1300 BC which formed the roof of the metal working furnace, the discovery was made by Vats in 1940 during excavation at Harappa [138] [139] [140]\n\n\nPre-Columbian America\nMayan architecture utilized the corbel arches The other Mesoamerican cultures used only the flat roofs with no arches whatsoever, [143] although some researchers had suggested that both Maya and Aztec architects understood the concept of a true arch [144] [145]\n\n\nRevival of the trabeated system\nThe 19th-century introduction of the wrought iron (and later steel) into construction changed the role of the arch Due to the high tensile strength of new materials, relatively long lintels became possible, as was demonstrated  by the tubular Britannia Bridge (Robert Stephenson, 1846-1850) A fervent proponent of the trabeated system, Alexander \"Greek\" Thomson, whose preference for lintels was originally based on aesthetic criteria, observed that the spans of this bridge are longer than that of any arch ever built, thus \"the simple, unsophisticated stone lintel contains in its structure all the scientific appliances  [...] used in the great tubular bridge  [...] Stonehenge is more scientifically constructed than York Minster.\" [146] Use of arches in bridge construction continued (the Britannia Bridge was rebuilt in 1972 as a truss arch bridge), yet the steel frames and reinforced concrete frames mostly replaced the arches as the load-bearing elements in buildings.\n\n\nConstruction\nAs a pure compression form, the utility of the arch is due to many building materials, including stone and unreinforced concrete, being strong under compression, but brittle when tensile stress is applied to them [147]\n\n\nMasonry\nThe voussoirs can be wedge-shaped or have a form of a rectangular cuboid, in the latter case the wedge-like shape is provided by the mortar [89]\n\n\nReinforced concrete\nIn reinforced concrete construction, the principle of the arch is used so as to benefit from the concrete's strength in resisting compressive stress Where any other form of stress is raised, such as tensile or torsional stress, it has to be resisted by carefully placed reinforcement rods or fibres [148]\n\n\nArchitectural styles\nThe type of arches (or absence of them) is one of the most prominent characteristics of an architectural style For example, when Heinrich Hübsch, in the 19th century, tried to classify the architectural style, his \"primary elements\" were roof and supports, with the top-level basic types: trabeated (no arches) and arcuated (arch-based) His next division for the arcuated styles was based on the use of round and pointed arch shapes [149]\n\n\nCultural references\nThe steady horizontal push of an arch against the abutments gave rise to a saying \"the arch never sleeps\", attributed to many sources, from Hindu [150] to Arabs [25] This adage stresses that the arch carries \"a seed of death\" for itself and the structure containing it, a statement that can be made upon observation of the Roman ruins [25] The plot of The Nebuly Coat by J Meade Falkner, inspired by a collapse of a tower at the Chichester Cathedral plays with the idea while dealing with the slow disintegration of a church building [150] Saoud [151] explains the proverb by chain-like self-balancing of the horizontal and vertical forces in the arch and its \"universal adaptability\" [152]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Multiple_sclerosis", "content": "\nSigns and symptoms\nAs multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions can affect any part of the central nervous system, a person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign referable to the central nervous system.\n\n\nMeasures of disability\nThe main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research [43] [44] [45] EDSS is also correlated with falls in people with MS [10] While it is a popular measure, EDSS has been criticized for some of its limitations, such as relying too much on walking [46] [10]\n\n\nDisease course\nMS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to its manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare [47] [48]\n\n\nProdromal phase\nMS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to its manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare [47] [48]\n\n\nOnset\nThe condition begins in 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, [31] and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties [5] Regarding optic neuritis as the most common presenting symptom, people with MS notice sub-acute loss of vision, often associated with pain worsening on eye movement, and reduced colour vision Early diagnosis of MS-associated optic neuritis helps timely initiation of targeted treatments However, it is crucial to adhere to established diagnostic criteria when treating optic neuritis due to the broad range of alternative causes, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and other autoimmune or infectious conditions The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases) [2] A combination of these two patterns may also occur [13] or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on [2]\n\n\nRelapses\nRelapses are usually unpredictable, occurring without warning [1] Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year [1] Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer [49] Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk [1] Stress may also trigger an attack [50]\n\n\nPregnancy\nMany people with MS who become pregnant experience lower symptoms [54] [55] [56] During the first months after delivery, the risk increases [1] Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability [1]\n\n\nCauses\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease with a combination of genetic and environmental causes underlying it Both T-cells and B-cells are involved, although T-cells are often considered to be the driving force of the disease The causes of the disease are not fully understood The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has been shown to be directly present in the brain of most cases of MS and the virus is transcriptionally active in infected cells [57] [58] EBV nuclear antigens are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, but not all people with MS have signs of EBV infection [15] Dozens of human peptides have been identified in different cases of the disease, and while some have plausible links to infectious organisms or known environmental factors, others do not [59]\n\n\nImmune dysregulation\nAs briefly detailed in the causes section of this article, MS is currently thought to stem from a failure of the body's immune system to kill off autoreactive T-cells & B-cells [15] Currently, the T-cell subpopulations that are thought to drive the development of MS are autoreactive CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ helper T-cells, and TH17 cells These autoreactive T-cells produce substances called cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response in the CNS, leading to the development of the disease [15] More recently, however, the role of autoreactive B-cells has been elucidated Evidence of their contribution to the development of MS is implicated through the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (antibodies produced by B-cells) in the CSF of patients with MS [15] [19] The presence of these oligoclonal bands has been used as supportive evidence in clinching a diagnosis of MS [89] As similarly described before, B-cells can also produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response via activation of autoreactive T-cells [15] [90] As such, higher levels of these autoreactive B-cells is associated with increased number of lesions & neurodegeneration as well as worse disability [15]\n\n\nInfectious agents\nEarly evidence suggested the association between several viruses with human demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections [60] One such virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), can cause infectious mononucleosis and infects about 95% of adults, though only a small proportion of those infected later develop MS [61] [16] [62] [58] A study of more than 10 million US military members compared 801 people who developed MS to 1,566 matched controls who did not develop MS The study found a 32-fold increased risk of developing MS after infection with EBV It did not find an increased risk after infection with other viruses, including the similar cytomegalovirus These findings strongly suggest that EBV plays a role in MS onset, although EBV alone may be insufficient to cause it [16] [62]\n\n\nGenetics\nMS is not considered a hereditary disease, but several genetic variations have been shown to increase its risk [65] Some of these genes appear to have higher expression levels in microglial cells than expected by chance [66] The probability of developing MS is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related [8] An identical twin of an affected individual has a 30% chance of developing MS, 5% for a nonidentical twin, 2.5% for a sibling, and an even lower chance for a half sibling [1] [8] [67] If both parents are affected, the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population [2] MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others [68]\n\n\nGeography\nThe prevalence of MS from a geographic standpoint resembles a gradient, with MS being more common in people who live farther from the equator (e.g those who live in northern regions of the world), although exceptions exist The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear, although exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and vitamin D levels have been proposed as potential explanations [71] [15] As such, those who live in northern regions of the world are thought to have less exposure to UVB radiation and subsequently lower levels of vitamin D, which is a known risk factor for developing MS [15] Inversely, those who live in areas of relatively higher sun exposure and subsequently increased UVB radiation have a decreased risk of developing MS [15] As of 2019, the north–south gradient of incidence is still present and is increasing [72]\n\n\nImpact of temperature\nMS symptoms may increase if body temperature is dysregulated [77] [78] [79] Fatigue is particularly affected [39] [40] [41] [42] [80] [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nOther\nSmoking may be an independent risk factor for MS [84] Stress may also be a risk factor, although the evidence to support this is weak [74] Association with occupational exposures and toxins—mainly organic solvents [85]—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached [74] Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; most studies, though, show no association [74] [86] Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been evaluated, but evidence on their relation with the disease is \"sparse and unpersuasive\" [84] Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown [87] Obesity during adolescence and young adulthood is a risk factor for MS [88]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, primarily mediated by T-cells [15] The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue, and in turn, the signs and symptoms of the disease [1] Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system [1]\n\n\nImmune dysregulation\nAs briefly detailed in the causes section of this article, MS is currently thought to stem from a failure of the body's immune system to kill off autoreactive T-cells & B-cells [15] Currently, the T-cell subpopulations that are thought to drive the development of MS are autoreactive CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ helper T-cells, and TH17 cells These autoreactive T-cells produce substances called cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response in the CNS, leading to the development of the disease [15] More recently, however, the role of autoreactive B-cells has been elucidated Evidence of their contribution to the development of MS is implicated through the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (antibodies produced by B-cells) in the CSF of patients with MS [15] [19] The presence of these oligoclonal bands has been used as supportive evidence in clinching a diagnosis of MS [89] As similarly described before, B-cells can also produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response via activation of autoreactive T-cells [15] [90] As such, higher levels of these autoreactive B-cells is associated with increased number of lesions & neurodegeneration as well as worse disability [15]\n\n\nLesions\nThe name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles [1] The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved [8]\n\n\nInflammation\nApart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocytes that plays an important role in the body's defenses [8] T cells gain entry into the brain as a result of disruptions in the blood–brain barrier The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called \"autoreactive lymphocytes\" [1]\n\n\nBlood–brain barrier\nThe blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain [8] [93] Gadolinium cannot cross a normal BBB, so gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns [94]\n\n\nMS fatigue\nThe pathophysiology and mechanisms causing MS fatigue are not well understood [95] [96] [97] MS fatigue can be affected by body heat, [77] [79] and this may differentiate MS fatigue from other primary fatigue [39] [40] [83] Fatigability (loss of strength) may increase perception of fatigue, but the two measures warrant independent assessment in clinical studies [98]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nMultiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing [5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems [1] [99]\n\n\nMcDonald criteria\nThe McDonald criteria, which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis [100] with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance [101] The McDonald criteria states that patients with multiple sclerosis should have lesions which are disseminated in time (DIT) and disseminated in space (DIS), i.e lesions which have appeared in different areas in the brain and at different times [89] Below is an abbreviated outline of the 2017 McDonald Criteria for diagnosis of MS.\n\n\nMRI\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques) Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques, and by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation [103] [104]\n\n\nIn vivo vs post portem lesion visibility in MRI scans\nOnly postmortem MRI allows visualization of sub-millimetric lesions in cortical layers and in the cerebellar cortex [111]\n\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture)\nTesting of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS [103] [112]\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nSeveral diseases present similarly to MS [113] [114] Medical professionals use a patient's specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings [113] [114]\n\n\nTypes and variants\nSeveral phenotypes (commonly termed \"types\"), or patterns of progression, have been described Phenotypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course They are important not only for prognosis, but also for treatment decisions.\n\n\nSpecial courses\nIndependently of the types published by the MS associations, regulatory agencies such as the FDA often consider special courses, trying to reflect some clinical trials results on their approval documents Some examples could be \"highly active MS\" (HAMS), [122] \"active secondary MS\" (similar to the old progressive-relapsing) [123] and \"rapidly progressing PPMS\" [124]\n\n\nVariants\nAtypical variants of MS have been described; these include tumefactive multiple sclerosis, Balo concentric sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg multiple sclerosis Debate remains on whether they are MS variants or different diseases [127] Some diseases previously considered MS variants, such as Devic's disease, are now considered outside the MS spectrum [128]\n\n\nManagement\nAlthough no cure for multiple sclerosis has been found, several therapies have proven helpful Several effective treatments can decrease the number of attacks and the rate of progression [23] The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability Starting medications is generally recommended in people after the first attack when more than two lesions are seen on MRI [129]\n\n\nInitial management of acute flare\nDuring symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, [1] with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile [130] Although effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery [131] [132] The long-term benefit is unclear in optic neuritis as of 2020 [133] [31] The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis [1]\n\n\nChronic management\nMultiple disease-modifying medications were approved by regulatory agencies for RRMS; they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks [134] Interferons [135] and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments [5] and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% [136] Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes [137] [138]\n\n\nRelapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\nMultiple disease-modifying medications were approved by regulatory agencies for RRMS; they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks [134] Interferons [135] and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments [5] and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% [136] Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes [137] [138]\n\n\nMedications\nMedications that influence voltage-gated sodium ion channels are under investigation as a potential neuroprotective strategy because of hypothesized role of sodium in the pathological process leading to axonal injury and accumulating disability There is insufficient evidence of an effect of sodium channel blockers for people with MS [235]\n\n\nProgressive multiple sclerosis\nIn 2011, mitoxantrone was the first medication approved for secondary progressive MS [151] In this population, tentative evidence supports mitoxantrone moderately slowing the progression of the disease and decreasing rates of relapses over two years [152] [153]\n\n\nAdverse effects\nThe disease-modifying treatments have several adverse effects One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections) [135] [162] Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop [162] Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; [163] some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes [164] More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, [165] systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, [152] [166] and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated) [5] [167]\n\n\nAssociated symptoms\nBoth medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease [170] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed [1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.\n\n\nNon-pharmaceutical\nThere is some evidence that aquatic therapy is a beneficial intervention [185]\n\n\nAlternative treatments\nOver 50% of people with MS may use complementary and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined [188] Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, tend to be more disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare [188] The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent [188] [189] Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, [188] [190] [191] vitamin D, [192] relaxation techniques such as yoga, [188] herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), [188] [193] [194] hyperbaric oxygen therapy, [195] self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, [188] [196] and mindfulness [197] Evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation, irrespective of the form and dose, provides no benefit for people with MS; this includes for measures such as relapse recurrence, disability, and MRI lesions while effects on health‐related quality of life and fatigue are unclear [198] There is insufficient evidence supporting high-dose biotin [199] [200] [201] and some evidence for increased disease activity and higher risk of relapse with its use [202] A recent review of the effectiveness of Cannabis and Cannabinoids (2022) found that compared with placebo nabiximols probably reduce the severity of spasticity in the short term [203]\n\n\nPrognosis\nThe availability of treatments that modify the course of multiple sclerosis beginning in the 1990s, known as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), has improved prognosis These treatments can reduce relapses and slow progression, but there is no cure [23] [204]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nMS is the most common autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system [22] The latest estimation of the total number of people with MS was 2.8 million globally, with a prevalence of 36 per 100,000 people Moreover, prevalence varies widely in different regions around the world [24] In Africa, there are five people per 100,000 diagnosed with MS, compared to South East Asia where the prevalence is nine per 100,000, 112 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 133 per 100,000 in Europe [211]\n\n\nHistory\nRobert Carswell (1793–1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease [215] Specifically, Carswell described the injuries he found as \"a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy\" [1] Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels [216] [217]\n\n\nMedical discovery\nRobert Carswell (1793–1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and

cord accompanied with atrophy\" [1] Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels [216] [217]\n\n\nDiagnosis history\nThe first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868 He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech) [218] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\" [25]\n\n\nHistorical cases\nThere are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS and lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot.\n\n\nResearch\nAs of 2022, the pathogenesis of MS as it relates to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is actively investigated, as are disease-modifying therapies; understanding of how risk factors combine with EBV to initiate MS is sought Whether EBV is the only cause of MS might be better understood if an EBV vaccine is developed and shown to prevent MS as well [16]\n\n\nEpstein-Barr virus\nAs of 2022, the pathogenesis of MS as it relates to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is actively investigated, as are disease-modifying therapies; understanding of how risk factors combine with EBV to initiate MS is sought Whether EBV is the only cause of MS might be better understood if an EBV vaccine is developed and shown to prevent MS as well [16]\n\n\nHuman endogenous retroviruses\nTwo members of the human endogenous retroviruses-W (HERV-W) family, namely, ERVWE1 and MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV), may be co-factors in MS immunopathogenesis HERVs constitute up to 8% of the human genome; most are epigenetically silent, but can be reactivated by exogenous viruses, proinflammatory conditions or oxidative stress [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nMedications\nMedications that influence voltage-gated sodium ion channels are under investigation as a potential neuroprotective strategy because of hypothesized role of sodium in the pathological process leading to axonal injury and accumulating disability There is insufficient evidence of an effect of sodium channel blockers for people with MS [235]\n\n\nPathogenesis\nMS is a clinically defined entity with several atypical presentations Some auto-antibodies have been found in atypical MS cases, giving birth to separate disease families and restricting the previously wider concept of MS.\n\n\nBiomarkers\nSince disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as neurofilaments, tau, and N-acetylaspartate are under investigation [240] [241]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nThe hospitalization rate was found to be higher among individuals with MS and COVID-19 infection, at 10%, while the pooled infection rate is estimated at 4% The pooled prevalence of death in hospitalized individuals with MS is estimated as 4% [244]\n\n\nMetformin\nA 2019 study on rats and a 2024 study on mice showed that a first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin, could promote remyelination [245] [246] The promising drug is currently being researched on humans in the Octopus trials, a multi-arm, multi-stage trial, focussed on testing existing drugs for other conditions on patients with MS [247] Currently, clinical trials on humans are ongoing in Belgium, for patients with non-active progressive MS, [248] in the U.K., in combination with clemastine for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, [249] and Canada, for MS patients up to 25 years old [250] [251]\n\n\nOther emerging theories\nOne emerging hypothesis, referred to as the hygiene hypothesis, suggests that early-life exposure to infectious agents helps to develop the immune system and reduces susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune disorders The hygiene hypothesis has been linked with MS and microbiome hypotheses [252]\n\n\nSee also\nCreutzfeldt–Jakob disease\n\n\nReferences\nCreutzfeldt–Jakob

It is characterized by the formation of lesions in the CNS, which can lead to a wide range of symptoms and disabilities.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of MS can vary widely from person to person, but they often include:\n\n* Vision problems, such as blurred vision, double vision, or loss of vision\n* Muscle weakness or numbness in the arms or legs\n* Fatigue or feeling tired\n* Difficulty with balance or coordination\n* Difficulty with speech or swallowing\n* Cognitive problems, such as memory loss or difficulty with concentration\n\nMS can also cause a range of other symptoms, including:\n\n* Mood changes, such as depression or anxiety\n* Pain, such as muscle spasms or headaches\n* Bladder or bowel problems\n* Seizures\n* Sleep disturbances\n\n**Measures of Disability**\n\nThe main measure of disability and severity in MS is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), which assesses the level of disability on a scale of 0 to 10. Other measures, such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite, are also used in research to assess the level of disability.\n\n**Disease Course**\n\nMS can have a variety of disease courses, including:\n\n* **Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)**: This is the most common type of MS, characterized by periods of relapses or exacerbations, which are followed by periods of remission.\n* **Secondary progressive MS (SPMS)**: This type of MS is characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms over time, with or without relapses.\n* **Primary progressive MS (PPMS)**: This type of MS is characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms from the beginning, with no relapses.\n* **Progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS)**: This type of MS is characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms, with occasional relapses.\n\n**Relapses**\n\nRelapses are unpredictable and can occur without warning. They are often triggered by factors such as stress, fatigue, or infections. Relapses can be mild or severe and can cause a range of symptoms, including vision problems, muscle weakness, and fatigue.\n\n**Pregnancy**\n\nMany people with MS who become pregnant experience a decrease in symptoms. However, the risk of relapses increases during the first months after delivery.\n\n**Causes**\n\nThe exact causes of MS are not fully understood, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease that is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to be present in the brains of most people with MS and is thought to play a role in the development of the disease.\n\n**Immune Dysregulation**\n\nMS is thought to be caused by a failure of the immune system to kill off autoreactive T-cells and B-cells. These cells can attack the myelin sheath of neurons, leading to the formation of lesions in the CNS.\n\n**Lesions**\n\nThe lesions in MS are characterized by the destruction of the myelin sheath of neurons, which can lead to a range of symptoms, including vision problems, muscle weakness, and fatigue.\n\n**Inflammation**\n\nInflammation is a key feature of MS, and it is thought to be caused by the activation of T-cells and other immune cells in the CNS. This can lead to the formation of lesions and the destruction of the myelin sheath of neurons.\n\n**Blood-Brain Barrier**\n\nThe blood-brain barrier is a specialized layer of cells that prevents the entry of immune cells into the CNS. However, in MS, this barrier is disrupted, allowing immune cells to enter the CNS and cause inflammation.\n\n**MS Fatigue**\n\nMS fatigue is a common symptom of the disease, and it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in the brain.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of MS is often based on a combination of clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and laboratory tests. The McDonald criteria are commonly used to diagnose MS.\n\n**Management**\n\nThere is no cure for MS, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These treatments include disease-modifying medications, corticosteroids, and physical therapy.\n\n**Disease-Modifying Medications**\n\nDisease-modifying medications are used to slow the progression of MS and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Examples of these medications include interferons, glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone.\n\n**Corticosteroids**\n\nCorticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and swelling in the CNS. They are often used to treat acute relapses and can help reduce the severity of symptoms.\n\n**Physical Therapy**\n\nPhysical therapy can help improve mobility and reduce disability in people with MS. It can also help manage symptoms such as fatigue and pain.\n\n**Emerging Theories**\n\nThere are several emerging theories about the causes of MS, including the hygiene hypothesis and the microbiome hypothesis.\n\n**Human Endogenous Retroviruses**\n\nHuman endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are a family of viruses that are integrated into the human genome. They are thought to play a role in the development of MS.\n\n**Metformin**\n\nMetformin is a medication that is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It has been shown to have potential benefits for people with MS, including the promotion of remyelination.\n\n**Other Emerging Theories**\n\nOther emerging theories about the causes of MS include the idea that the disease is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and that the immune system plays a key role in the development of the disease.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Multiple_sclerosis\" following this outline:\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nAs multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions can affect any part of the central nervous system, a person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign referable to the central nervous system.\n\n\nMeasures of disability\nThe main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research [43] [44] [45] EDSS is also correlated with falls in people with MS [10] While it is a popular measure, EDSS has been criticized for some of its limitations, such as relying too much on walking [46] [10]\n\n\nDisease course\nMS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to its manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare [47] [48]\n\n\nProdromal phase\nMS may have a prodromal phase in the years leading up to its manifestation, characterized by psychiatric issues, cognitive impairment, and increased use of healthcare [47] [48]\n\n\nOnset\nThe condition begins in 85% of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) over a number of days with 45% having motor or sensory problems, 20% having optic neuritis, [31] and 10% having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction, while the remaining 25% have more than one of the previous difficulties [5] Regarding optic neuritis as the most common presenting symptom, people with MS notice sub-acute loss of vision, often associated with pain worsening on eye movement, and reduced colour vision Early diagnosis of MS-associated optic neuritis helps timely initiation of targeted treatments However, it is crucial to adhere to established diagnostic criteria when treating optic neuritis due to the broad range of alternative causes, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and other autoimmune or infectious conditions The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially: either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months (called relapses, exacerbations, bouts, attacks, or flare-ups) followed by improvement (85% of cases) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery (10–15% of cases) [2] A combination of these two patterns may also occur [13] or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on [2]\n\n\nRelapses\nRelapses are usually unpredictable, occurring without warning [1] Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year [1] Some relapses, however, are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer [49] Similarly, viral infections such as the common cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk [1] Stress may also trigger an attack [50]\n\n\nPregnancy\nMany people with MS who become pregnant experience lower symptoms [54] [55] [56] During the first months after delivery, the risk increases [1] Overall, pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability [1]\n\n\nCauses\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease with a combination of genetic and environmental causes underlying it Both T-cells and B-cells are involved, although T-cells are often considered to be the driving force of the disease The causes of the disease are not fully understood The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has been shown to be directly present in the brain of most cases of MS and the virus is transcriptionally active in infected cells [57] [58] EBV nuclear antigens are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, but not all people with MS have signs of EBV infection [15] Dozens of human peptides have been identified in different cases of the disease, and while some have plausible links to infectious organisms or known environmental factors, others do not [59]\n\n\nImmune dysregulation\nAs briefly detailed in the causes section of this article, MS is currently thought to stem from a failure of the body's immune system to kill off autoreactive T-cells & B-cells [15] Currently, the T-cell subpopulations that are thought to drive the development of MS are autoreactive CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ helper T-cells, and TH17 cells These autoreactive T-cells produce substances called cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response in the CNS, leading to the development of the disease [15] More recently, however, the role of autoreactive B-cells has been elucidated Evidence of their contribution to the development of MS is implicated through the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (antibodies produced by B-cells) in the CSF of patients with MS [15] [19] The presence of these oligoclonal bands has been used as supportive evidence in clinching a diagnosis of MS [89] As similarly described before, B-cells can also produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response via activation of autoreactive T-cells [15] [90] As such, higher levels of these autoreactive B-cells is associated with increased number of lesions & neurodegeneration as well as worse disability [15]\n\n\nInfectious agents\nEarly evidence suggested the association between several viruses with human demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections [60] One such virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), can cause infectious mononucleosis and infects about 95% of adults, though only a small proportion of those infected later develop MS [61] [16] [62] [58] A study of more than 10 million US military members compared 801 people who developed MS to 1,566 matched controls who did not develop MS The study found a 32-fold increased risk of developing MS after infection with EBV It did not find an increased risk after infection with other viruses, including the similar cytomegalovirus These findings strongly suggest that EBV plays a role in MS onset, although EBV alone may be insufficient to cause it [16] [62]\n\n\nGenetics\nMS is not considered a hereditary disease, but several genetic variations have been shown to increase its risk [65] Some of these genes appear to have higher expression levels in microglial cells than expected by chance [66] The probability of developing MS is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related [8] An identical twin of an affected individual has a 30% chance of developing MS, 5% for a nonidentical twin, 2.5% for a sibling, and an even lower chance for a half sibling [1] [8] [67] If both parents are affected, the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population [2] MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others [68]\n\n\nGeography\nThe prevalence of MS from a geographic standpoint resembles a gradient, with MS being more common in people who live farther from the equator (e.g those who live in northern regions of the world), although exceptions exist The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear, although exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and vitamin D levels have been proposed as potential explanations [71] [15] As such, those who live in northern regions of the world are thought to have less exposure to UVB radiation and subsequently lower levels of vitamin D, which is a known risk factor for developing MS [15] Inversely, those who live in areas of relatively higher sun exposure and subsequently increased UVB radiation have a decreased risk of developing MS [15] As of 2019, the north–south gradient of incidence is still present and is increasing [72]\n\n\nImpact of temperature\nMS symptoms may increase if body temperature is dysregulated [77] [78] [79] Fatigue is particularly affected [39] [40] [41] [42] [80] [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nOther\nSmoking may be an independent risk factor for MS [84] Stress may also be a risk factor, although the evidence to support this is weak [74] Association with occupational exposures and toxins—mainly organic solvents [85]—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached [74] Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; most studies, though, show no association [74] [86] Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been evaluated, but evidence on their relation with the disease is \"sparse and unpersuasive\" [84] Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown [87] Obesity during adolescence and young adulthood is a risk factor for MS [88]\n\n\nPathophysiology\nMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, primarily mediated by T-cells [15] The three main characteristics of MS are the formation of lesions in the central nervous system (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of nerve tissue, and in turn, the signs and symptoms of the disease [1] Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system [1]\n\n\nImmune dysregulation\nAs briefly detailed in the causes section of this article, MS is currently thought to stem from a failure of the body's immune system to kill off autoreactive T-cells & B-cells [15] Currently, the T-cell subpopulations that are thought to drive the development of MS are autoreactive CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ helper T-cells, and TH17 cells These autoreactive T-cells produce substances called cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response in the CNS, leading to the development of the disease [15] More recently, however, the role of autoreactive B-cells has been elucidated Evidence of their contribution to the development of MS is implicated through the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (antibodies produced by B-cells) in the CSF of patients with MS [15] [19] The presence of these oligoclonal bands has been used as supportive evidence in clinching a diagnosis of MS [89] As similarly described before, B-cells can also produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory immune response via activation of autoreactive T-cells [15] [90] As such, higher levels of these autoreactive B-cells is associated with increased number of lesions & neurodegeneration as well as worse disability [15]\n\n\nLesions\nThe name multiple sclerosis refers to the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles [1] The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest of the body The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved [8]\n\n\nInflammation\nApart from demyelination, the other sign of the disease is inflammation Fitting with an immunological explanation, the inflammatory process is caused by T cells, a kind of lymphocytes that plays an important role in the body's defenses [8] T cells gain entry into the brain as a result of disruptions in the blood–brain barrier The T cells recognize myelin as foreign and attack it, explaining why these cells are also called \"autoreactive lymphocytes\" [1]\n\n\nBlood–brain barrier\nThe blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a part of the capillary system that prevents the entry of T cells into the central nervous system It may become permeable to these types of cells secondary to an infection by a virus or bacteria After it repairs itself, typically once the infection has cleared, T cells may remain trapped inside the brain [8] [93] Gadolinium cannot cross a normal BBB, so gadolinium-enhanced MRI is used to show BBB breakdowns [94]\n\n\nMS fatigue\nThe pathophysiology and mechanisms causing MS fatigue are not well understood [95] [96] [97] MS fatigue can be affected by body heat, [77] [79] and this may differentiate MS fatigue from other primary fatigue [39] [40] [83] Fatigability (loss of strength) may increase perception of fatigue, but the two measures warrant independent assessment in clinical studies [98]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nMultiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed based on the presenting signs and symptoms, in combination with supporting medical imaging and laboratory testing [5] It can be difficult to confirm, especially early on, since the signs and symptoms may be similar to those of other medical problems [1] [99]\n\n\nMcDonald criteria\nThe McDonald criteria, which focus on clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evidence of lesions at different times and in different areas, is the most commonly used method of diagnosis [100] with the Schumacher and Poser criteria being of mostly historical significance [101] The McDonald criteria states that patients with multiple sclerosis should have lesions which are disseminated in time (DIT) and disseminated in space (DIS), i.e lesions which have appeared in different areas in the brain and at different times [89] Below is an abbreviated outline of the 2017 McDonald Criteria for diagnosis of MS.\n\n\nMRI\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques) Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques, and by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation [103] [104]\n\n\nIn vivo vs post portem lesion visibility in MRI scans\nOnly postmortem MRI allows visualization of sub-millimetric lesions in cortical layers and in the cerebellar cortex [111]\n\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture)\nTesting of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS [103] [112]\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nSeveral diseases present similarly to MS [113] [114] Medical professionals use a patient's specific presentation, history, and exam findings to make an individualized differential Red flags are findings that suggest an alternate diagnosis, although they do not rule out MS Red flags include a patient younger than 15 or older than 60, less than 24 hours of symptoms, involvement of multiple cranial nerves, involvement of organs outside of the nervous system, and atypical lab and exam findings [113] [114]\n\n\nTypes and variants\nSeveral phenotypes (commonly termed \"types\"), or patterns of progression, have been described Phenotypes use the past course of the disease in an attempt to predict the future course They are important not only for prognosis, but also for treatment decisions.\n\n\nSpecial courses\nIndependently of the types published by the MS associations, regulatory agencies such as the FDA often consider special courses, trying to reflect some clinical trials results on their approval documents Some examples could be \"highly active MS\" (HAMS), [122] \"active secondary MS\" (similar to the old progressive-relapsing) [123] and \"rapidly progressing PPMS\" [124]\n\n\nVariants\nAtypical variants of MS have been described; these include tumefactive multiple sclerosis, Balo concentric sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg multiple sclerosis Debate remains on whether they are MS variants or different diseases [127] Some diseases previously considered MS variants, such as Devic's disease, are now considered outside the MS spectrum [128]\n\n\nManagement\nAlthough no cure for multiple sclerosis has been found, several therapies have proven helpful Several effective treatments can decrease the number of attacks and the rate of progression [23] The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability Starting medications is generally recommended in people after the first attack when more than two lesions are seen on MRI [129]\n\n\nInitial management of acute flare\nDuring symptomatic attacks, administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, [1] with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile [130] Although effective in the short term for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery [131] [132] The long-term benefit is unclear in optic neuritis as of 2020 [133] [31] The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis [1]\n\n\nChronic management\nMultiple disease-modifying medications were approved by regulatory agencies for RRMS; they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks [134] Interferons [135] and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments [5] and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% [136] Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes [137] [138]\n\n\nRelapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\nMultiple disease-modifying medications were approved by regulatory agencies for RRMS; they are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks [134] Interferons [135] and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments [5] and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% [136] Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes [137] [138]\n\n\nMedications\nMedications that influence voltage-gated sodium ion channels are under investigation as a potential neuroprotective strategy because of hypothesized role of sodium in the pathological process leading to axonal injury and accumulating disability There is insufficient evidence of an effect of sodium channel blockers for people with MS [235]\n\n\nProgressive multiple sclerosis\nIn 2011, mitoxantrone was the first medication approved for secondary progressive MS [151] In this population, tentative evidence supports mitoxantrone moderately slowing the progression of the disease and decreasing rates of relapses over two years [152] [153]\n\n\nAdverse effects\nThe disease-modifying treatments have several adverse effects One of the most common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections) [135] [162] Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop [162] Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; [163] some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes [164] More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, [165] systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, [152] [166] and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated) [5] [167]\n\n\nAssociated symptoms\nBoth medications and neurorehabilitation have been shown to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease [170] Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as bladder spasticity, while others are little changed [1] Equipment such as catheters for neurogenic bladder dysfunction or mobility aids can be helpful in improving functional status.\n\n\nNon-pharmaceutical\nThere is some evidence that aquatic therapy is a beneficial intervention [185]\n\n\nAlternative treatments\nOver 50% of people with MS may use complementary and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined [188] Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, tend to be more disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare [188] The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent [188] [189] Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, [188] [190] [191] vitamin D, [192] relaxation techniques such as yoga, [188] herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), [188] [193] [194] hyperbaric oxygen therapy, [195] self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, [188] [196] and mindfulness [197] Evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation, irrespective of the form and dose, provides no benefit for people with MS; this includes for measures such as relapse recurrence, disability, and MRI lesions while effects on health‐related quality of life and fatigue are unclear [198] There is insufficient evidence supporting high-dose biotin [199] [200] [201] and some evidence for increased disease activity and higher risk of relapse with its use [202] A recent review of the effectiveness of Cannabis and Cannabinoids (2022) found that compared with placebo nabiximols probably reduce the severity of spasticity in the short term [203]\n\n\nPrognosis\nThe availability of treatments that modify the course of multiple sclerosis beginning in the 1990s, known as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), has improved prognosis These treatments can reduce relapses and slow progression, but there is no cure [23] [204]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nMS is the most common autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system [22] The latest estimation of the total number of people with MS was 2.8 million globally, with a prevalence of 36 per 100,000 people Moreover, prevalence varies widely in different regions around the world [24] In Africa, there are five people per 100,000 diagnosed with MS, compared to South East Asia where the prevalence is nine per 100,000, 112 per 100,000 in the Americas, and 133 per 100,000 in Europe [211]\n\n\nHistory\nRobert Carswell (1793–1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and illustrated many of the disease's clinical details, but did not identify it as a separate disease [215] Specifically, Carswell described the injuries he found as \"a remarkable lesion of the spinal cord accompanied with atrophy\" [1] Under the microscope, Swiss pathologist Georg Eduard Rindfleisch (1836–1908) noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around blood vessels [216] [217]\n\n\nMedical discovery\nRobert Carswell (1793–1857), a British professor of pathology, and Jean Cruveilhier (1791–1873), a French professor of pathologic anatomy, described and

vessels [216] [217]\n\n\nDiagnosis history\nThe first attempt to establish a set of diagnostic criteria was also due to Charcot in 1868 He published what now is known as the \"Charcot Triad\", consisting in nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech (scanning speech) [218] Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a \"marked enfeeblement of the memory\" and \"conceptions that formed slowly\" [25]\n\n\nHistorical cases\nThere are several historical accounts of people who probably had MS and lived before or shortly after the disease was described by Charcot.\n\n\nResearch\nAs of 2022, the pathogenesis of MS as it relates to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is actively investigated, as are disease-modifying therapies; understanding of how risk factors combine with EBV to initiate MS is sought Whether EBV is the only cause of MS might be better understood if an EBV vaccine is developed and shown to prevent MS as well [16]\n\n\nEpstein-Barr virus\nAs of 2022, the pathogenesis of MS as it relates to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is actively investigated, as are disease-modifying therapies; understanding of how risk factors combine with EBV to initiate MS is sought Whether EBV is the only cause of MS might be better understood if an EBV vaccine is developed and shown to prevent MS as well [16]\n\n\nHuman endogenous retroviruses\nTwo members of the human endogenous retroviruses-W (HERV-W) family, namely, ERVWE1 and MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV), may be co-factors in MS immunopathogenesis HERVs constitute up to 8% of the human genome; most are epigenetically silent, but can be reactivated by exogenous viruses, proinflammatory conditions or oxidative stress [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nMedications\nMedications that influence voltage-gated sodium ion channels are under investigation as a potential neuroprotective strategy because of hypothesized role of sodium in the pathological process leading to axonal injury and accumulating disability There is insufficient evidence of an effect of sodium channel blockers for people with MS [235]\n\n\nPathogenesis\nMS is a clinically defined entity with several atypical presentations Some auto-antibodies have been found in atypical MS cases, giving birth to separate disease families and restricting the previously wider concept of MS.\n\n\nBiomarkers\nSince disease progression is the result of degeneration of neurons, the roles of proteins showing loss of nerve tissue such as neurofilaments, tau, and N-acetylaspartate are under investigation [240] [241]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nThe hospitalization rate was found to be higher among individuals with MS and COVID-19 infection, at 10%, while the pooled infection rate is estimated at 4% The pooled prevalence of death in hospitalized individuals with MS is estimated as 4% [244]\n\n\nMetformin\nA 2019 study on rats and a 2024 study on mice showed that a first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, metformin, could promote remyelination [245] [246] The promising drug is currently being researched on humans in the Octopus trials, a multi-arm, multi-stage trial, focussed on testing existing drugs for other conditions on patients with MS [247] Currently, clinical trials on humans are ongoing in Belgium, for patients with non-active progressive MS, [248] in the U.K., in combination with clemastine for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, [249] and Canada, for MS patients up to 25 years old [250] [251]\n\n\nOther emerging theories\nOne emerging hypothesis, referred to as the hygiene hypothesis, suggests that early-life exposure to infectious agents helps to develop the immune system and reduces susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune disorders The hygiene hypothesis has been linked with MS and microbiome hypotheses [252]\n\n\nSee also\nCreutzfeldt–Jakob disease\n\n\nReferences\nCreutzfeldt–Jakob

The film stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, a man whose wife Amy (played by Rosamund Pike) goes missing on the day of their fifth wedding anniversary, and the subsequent investigation that uncovers dark secrets about their marriage and the people they trust.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film opens with Nick returning home from a bar to find that Amy is missing, with no signs of forced entry or struggle. The police investigation that follows reveals that Amy's parents and Nick's twin sister are not as supportive as they seem, and that Amy's diary entries suggest that she was unhappy in her marriage. As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that Nick is hiding secrets about his relationship with Amy, and that the media is portraying him as a suspect.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, Rosamund Pike as Amy Dunne, Neil Patrick Harris as Desi Collings, Tyler Perry as Tanner Bolt, and Carrie Coon as Margo Dunne. The cast received widespread critical acclaim for their performances, with Pike's portrayal of Amy being particularly praised.\n\n## Production\n\nProduction on the film began in September 2013, with Fincher directing and Flynn writing the screenplay. The film was shot on location in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Los Angeles, with a budget of $61 million. The film's score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who had previously collaborated with Fincher on The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\n## Fashion\n\nThe film's costume design was handled by Trish Summerville, who wanted to create a sense of contemporary style while also reflecting the characters' personalities. Summerville chose to dress Amy in a way that reflected her \"cool girl\" persona, with a focus on timeless and understated pieces. Nick's wardrobe, on the other hand, was more functional and practical, reflecting his more laid-back personality.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who had previously collaborated with Fincher on The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Fincher had asked Reznor to create a score that reflected the film's themes of deception and manipulation, and Reznor had created a score that was both haunting and atmospheric.\n\n## Release\n\nThe film premiered at the 52nd New York Film Festival in October 2014, and was released in theaters in the United States on October 3, 2014. The film was released in over 3,000 theaters, and grossed over $167 million in its opening weekend.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in January 2015, with a special feature that included an audio commentary with Fincher. The Blu-ray release also included a 36-page book called \"Tattle Tale\", which was a companion to the film.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the performances of the cast, particularly Pike's portrayal of Amy. The film holds a 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8/10. The film's score was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who had previously collaborated with Fincher on The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film received numerous awards and nominations, including four nominations at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and two nominations at the 87th Academy Awards. Rosamund Pike received a nomination for Best Actress at the 87th Academy Awards, and the film's score was nominated for the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\n## Top ten lists\n\nThe film was included on many critics' top ten lists, including those of Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, and The New York Times.\n\n## Themes\n\nThe film explores themes of marriage, deception, and the unreliability of appearances. The film also explores the idea that people are not always what they seem, and that appearances can be deceiving.\n\n## Gender\n\nThe film has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters, and its exploration of the complexities of female relationships. The film also explores the idea that women are not always passive victims, but can be active agents of their own lives.\n\n## Potential sequel\n\nThere have been rumors of a potential sequel to the film, with Rosamund Pike stating that she would return if Gillian Flynn wrote the script. Flynn has also expressed interest in writing a sequel, but has stated that it would be a few years down the road.\n\n## Real world kidnapping\n\nThe film's plot was inspired by a real-life kidnapping case, and the film's portrayal of the kidnapping was seen as eerily similar to the real-life case. However, the film's portrayal of the kidnapping was not entirely accurate, and the real-life victim was not the perpetrator of a hoax.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of films based on novels\n* List of psychological thriller films\n* List of films directed by David Fincher\n* List of films written by Gillian Flynn\n\n## External links\n\n* Gone Girl at IMDb\n* Gone Girl at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Gone Girl at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gone_Girl_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nOn their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy missing Amy's fame as the inspiration for her parents' successful Amazing Amy children's books ensures widespread press coverage The media finds Nick's apathy towards the disappearance suspicious.\n\n\nCast\nGone Girl is a film adaptation of Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name One of the film's executive producers, Leslie Dixon, read the manuscript of the novel in 2011 and brought it to the attention of Reese Witherspoon (who was originally slated to play Amy) in December of that year Witherspoon and Dixon then collaborated with Bruna Papandrea to further develop the manuscript—with Flynn's film agent, Shari Smiley, they met with film studios in early 2012 [9]\n\n\nProduction\nGone Girl is a film adaptation of Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name One of the film's executive producers, Leslie Dixon, read the manuscript of the novel in 2011 and brought it to the attention of Reese Witherspoon (who was originally slated to play Amy) in December of that year Witherspoon and Dixon then collaborated with Bruna Papandrea to further develop the manuscript—with Flynn's film agent, Shari Smiley, they met with film studios in early 2012 [9]\n\n\nDevelopment\nGone Girl is a film adaptation of Flynn's 2012 novel of the same name One of the film's executive producers, Leslie Dixon, read the manuscript of the novel in 2011 and brought it to the attention of Reese Witherspoon (who was originally slated to play Amy) in December of that year Witherspoon and Dixon then collaborated with Bruna Papandrea to further develop the manuscript—with Flynn's film agent, Shari Smiley, they met with film studios in early 2012 [9]\n\n\nFilming\nOn September 11, 2013, the Gone Girl film crew began filming establishing shots [15] Principal photography began on September 15 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and was scheduled to last about five weeks [16] [17] Some interior scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, [17] with a door that could not be replicated being shipped there from Cape Girardeau [18]\n\n\nFashion\nThe lead costume designer in Gone Girl is Trish Summerville [20] Summerville has worked with director David Fincher as the costume designer for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo [21] Summerville told InStyle magazine, that she wanted Nick and Amy's clothing to look contemporary due to the film's present-day setting, yet understated and simple as to illustrate the idea that Nick and Amy are a regular and unassuming couple Summerville goes on to explain that she wanted the clothes to look like everyday life as if they ordered them online or bought them at the mall, she tells [21] that figuring out what Nick and Amy's 'everyday life' is like was one of her biggest challenges [21] As a result of Amy's self-proclaimed 'cool girl' status, her costumes directly reflect the traditionally chic yet girl-next-door attitude Amy's pieces can be seen as more timeless than high fashion and trendy as Summerville explains that Amy is just \"kind of not that girl.\" [21] This is also exemplified through Amy's jewelry;

limited [104]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nPeru is one of the worst-affected nations in the world from the COVID-19 pandemic, with at least 0.5% of the total population and nearly 1% of Lima dying leading up to the election [1] [121] [122] [123] The crisis became so intense by January 2021 due to a second wave of infections that ICU bed occupancy in Peru rose to 90%, with medical workers beginning to participate in strikes due to their harsh work conditions [124] Due to the intensity of the pandemic, the election became less of a priority for voters and many remained undecided or refused to vote outright [1]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru's gross domestic product fell 30.2 percent in the second quarter of 2020, the largest decline of all major economies, with many small service businesses that represent the majority of businesses of Peru's economy going bankrupt during the crisis [130] Medical experts commented that the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in Peru can be explained at least in part due to existing socioeconomic circumstances; nearly one-third of Peruvians lived in overcrowded homes, 72% had informal jobs requiring daily work and many needed to travel daily to markets to purchase food since only 49% of households own refrigerators or freezers; even in urban areas it is only 61% [131]\n\n\nImmigration\nAs a result of the Venezuelan refugee crisis, Peru was home to over one million Venezuelans in February 2021 [135] [136] At that time, the Peruvian Armed Forces were deployed in a joint operation with Ecuadorian counterparts to the Ecuador-Peru border to prevent the entry of illegal migrants, with the armed forces stating that it was to prevent further introduction of COVID-19 in Peru [136] Human rights organizations criticized the militarization of the border, saying that they are not properly trained for border enforcement and that it violates the human rights of migrants [136] Xenophobia towards Venezuelans in Peru has also increased, as some politicians have blamed increased crime on the migrants, although the Brookings Institution and Migration Policy Institute found that Venezuelan participate in less crime in Peru than native Peruvians [137]\n\n\nSan Miguel del Ene attack\nComrade Vilma, with close ties to Comrade José, head of the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP), a communist organization that split from Shining Path at least ten years before the San Miguel del Ene attack, [143] [144] [145] called for a boycott of elections on 14 May [146] During the second round of elections, Vilma called on voters not to vote for Fujimori, stating that anyone who voted for her would be the \"accomplice of genociders and the corrupt.\" [146]\n\n\nAnalysis\nPolitical parties in Peru have been controlled by individuals seeking their own benefits, usually financial compensation [153] According to The Economist, political graft was the largest challenge facing Peru instead of the ideological battles in the press [153] Due to the large divisions of parties in congress, with over eleven parties elected into the Congress of Peru, whoever was elected into the presidency was expected to be weak due to the fractured congress [153] Political analyst Giovanna Peñaflor agreed with the theory of a weak presidency, saying that the fragmented congress would leave the executive vulnerable to legislators [154]\n\n\nParty politics\nPolitical parties in Peru have been controlled by individuals seeking their own benefits, usually financial compensation [153] According to The Economist, political graft

the fragmented congress would leave the executive vulnerable to legislators [154]\n\n\nRural vs. urban debate\nIn democratic elections since 1919, eleven of eighteen presidents of Peru were from Lima, even as many Peruvians in rural areas were not able to vote until 1979 when the constitution allowed illiterate individuals to vote [161] As globalization intensified through the twentieth century, distances between urban and rural areas increased, with larger cities increasing their ability to connect to the economy and increasing their wealth while smaller cities experienced resource and human capital flight to larger cities [1] Although economic statistics show improved economic data in Peru in recent decades, the wealth earned between 1990 and 2020 was not distributed throughout the country; living standards showed disparities between the more-developed capital city of Lima and similar coastal regions while rural provinces remained impoverished [28] [161] The COVID-19 pandemic exasperated these disparities even further, with rural Peruvians feeling a sense of abandonment by the government as trade and trans-regional travel were prohibited, fueling increased distrust and autonomy among interior regions of the nation [1] [161]\n\n\nPolarization\nDue to the internal conflict in Peru involving far-left guerrilla groups attacking Peru's institutions which mainly occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, sentiments towards left-wing political parties have a negative stigma skewed against them [144] [142] While campaigning occurred during the elections, right-wing politicians would often baselessly characterize left-wing politicians as terrorists, or terrucos in Peruvian Spanish, with the attacks being so common that they were given the term terruqueo [142] Billboards in support of Fujimori during the second round disseminated a message framing the election as being between \"freedom and dictatorship\" and \"democracy and communism\" [165]\n\n\nMedia\nDuring the intense periods of internal conflict in Peru in the 1980s and 1990s when far-left groups waged an insurgency, the government, military, and media in described any individual who was far-left on the political spectrum as being a threat to the nation, with many students, professors, union members, and peasants being jailed or killed for their political beliefs [144]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nThe first round was held on 11 April [11] [180] The first exit polls published indicated that underdog nominee Pedro Castillo of Free Peru had placed first in the first round of voting with approximately 16.1% of the vote, with Hernando de Soto and Keiko Fujimori tying with 11.9% each [180] Yonhy Lescano, Rafael López Aliaga, Verónika Mendoza, and George Forsyth followed, with each receiving 11.0%, 10.5%, 8.8%, and 6.4%, respectively [180] César Acuña and Daniel Urresti received 5.8% and 5.0%, respectively, while the rest of the nominees attained less than 3% of the popular vote [181]

Peru (UPP) and the Broad Front (FA) had their worst results ever, attaining no representation [20] The Peruvian Nationalist Party of former President Ollanta Humala and National Victory of George Forsyth (who led polling for the presidential election earlier in the year) failed to win seats as well [20] New or previously minor parties such as Free Peru, Go on Country and Together for Peru and Popular Renewal, the successor of National Solidarity, had good results, with Free Peru becoming the largest party in Congress [20] Contigo, the successor to former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's Peruvians for Change party, failed to win a seat once again and received less than 1% of the vote [20] On 26 July, two days before Castillo was sworn in as Peru's President, an opposition alliance led

accusations and the final vote count, there were nearly daily protests and marches, mostly in the capital Lima [185] Besides Fujimori supporters, groups opposed to Castillo, mobilized by the fear of communism or aversion to the left wing, mobilized asking for the annulment of the elections [186] After exit polls gave the victory to Keiko Fujimori over Pedro Castillo, supporters of Free Peru mobilized to the offices of the ONPE to protest against a possible fraud against their candidate, [187] bringing banners saying \"no to the fraud.\" [188] From Tacabamba, Cajamarca, [189] Castillo called upon his followers and supporters on Twitter to \"defend the votes\" and go to the streets to \"defend democracy.\" [190] Protests against Fujimori and an alleged fraud took place in cities such as Juliaca, Puno, and Ilave [191] During a mobilization in the San Martín Square in Lima, rondas campesinas supportive of Castillo carried machetes with them [192] On 14 July, several pro-Fujimori protesters gathered at the Government Palace demanding an audit of the election Protesters clashed with the National Police of Peru, and Health Minister Óscar Ugarte and Housing Minister Solangel Fernández were attacked during the protests [193] [194] On 15 July, Sagasti reaffirmed that there was no evidence of voter fraud [195]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter the publication of the quick count

to the streets to \"defend democracy.\" [190] Protests against Fujimori and an alleged fraud took place in cities such as Juliaca, Puno, and Ilave [191] During a mobilization in the San Martín Square in Lima, rondas campesinas supportive of Castillo carried machetes with them [192] On 14 July, several pro-Fujimori protesters gathered at the Government Palace demanding an audit of the election Protesters clashed with the National Police of Peru, and Health Minister Óscar Ugarte and Housing Minister Solangel Fernández were attacked during the protests [193] [194] On 15 July, Sagasti reaffirmed that there was no evidence of voter fraud [195]\n\n\nOverturn attempts\nAfter the publication of the quick count and the first official results, protests by supporters of both Free Peru and Popular Force took place [184] Amid the fraud accusations and the final vote count, there were nearly daily protests and marches, mostly in the capital Lima [185] Besides Fujimori supporters, groups opposed to Castillo, mobilized by the fear of communism or aversion to the left wing, mobilized asking for the annulment of the elections [186] After exit polls gave the victory to Keiko Fujimori over Pedro Castillo, supporters of Free Peru mobilized to the offices of the ONPE to protest against a possible fraud against their candidate, [187] bringing banners saying \"no to the fraud.\" [188] From

avoid the questions of election legitimacy, election authorities in Peru approved the use of election monitoring [204] In total, one hundred and fifty observers (ninety-nine in Peru and fifty-one abroad) were approved to observe elections throughout Peru [204] The origin of the observers were from twenty-two different countries, with thirty-five observers from the Organization of American States, while others were from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and Uruguay [204] Observer approval required providing election authorities observation plans; these plans included protocols to inform authorities of crimes, violations of electoral law or any complaints they collected [204] Observers were then responsible with providing an official, final report to authorities [204] According to OjoPúblico, \"the observers carry out the review of the activities of election day, ranging from the installation of the voting tables, the conditioning of the secret chambers, the conformity of the ballots, the minutes, the amphorae and any other electoral material, to the counting, the counting of the vote and the transfer of the electoral records at the end of the day.\" [204]\n\n\nMontesinos and JNE scandal\nOn 25 June, former 2001 and 2016 presidential candidate Fernando Olivera revealed audio tapes, alleging that Vladimiro Montesinos, who was the right hand man to former President Alberto Fujimori currently serving a prison sentence for crimes committed during the Fujimori period, was behind the attempts for Keiko Fujimori to be declared as the winner of the second round against Castillo, including through the payment of bribes to electoral officials and influencing the National Jury of Elections The National Penitentiary Institute and Peruvian Navy announced an investigation, confirming that Montesinos made two phone calls from Callao Naval Base where he is jailed, on 10 and 23 June to unauthorised persons coordinating the effort to overturn the election [219] [220]\n\n\nReactions\nLourdes Flores, leader of the Christian People's Party, which supported Fujimori in the election, argued carrying out her own analysis of certain electoral acts, concluding that there was a mechanism to \"improperly incline the vote\" in favor of Pedro Castillo [222] Rafael López Aliaga, former presidential candidate for Popular Renewal who supported Fujimori as well, argued that the second round or ballot should be repeated because \"there is a fraud that cannot be covered up anymore\" [223] Alfredo Barnechea, former candidate for Popular Action, affirmed that the irregularities detected were \"massive\" and that therefore the ballot should be repeated with international observation or else whoever is elected \"will not have any legitimacy.\" [224]\n\n\nDomestic\nLourdes Flores, leader of the Christian People's Party, which supported Fujimori in the election, argued

President of Argentina Alberto Fernández tweeted that he had spoken to the \"President-elect\" Castillo and that he wished to cooperate with him [233] President of Bolivia Luis Arce tweeted that \"Bolivia joins the celebration of the Peruvian people\", calling Castillo his \"brother\", and stating that the two would \"continue the struggle for a tomorrow with justice and equality for the people.\" [234] Evo Morales and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Bolivia and Brazil, respectively, also congratulated Castillo [233]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nIn late June, an IEP poll showed that thirty-one percent of participants believed in Fujimori's claims of fraud [197] A statistical analysis of the company Ipsos Peru on the results published by the National Office of Electoral Processes did not find evidence of an atypical distribution of votes to any candidate, neither in certain geographical areas nor for a particular candidate [241] In a survey carried out by Datum Internacional, 65% of respondents (both Pedro Castillo and Keiko Fujimori voters) believed that there were \"signs\" of fraud in the elections [242] [243] A survey by the Institute of Peruvian Studies showed that 66% of participants considered that Castillo had won the election [244]\n\n\nNotes\nSupporting Parties\n\n\nReferences\nSupporting Parties\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# 2021

population and nearly 1% of Lima dying leading up to the election [1] [121] [122] [123] The crisis became so intense by January 2021 due to a second wave of infections that ICU bed occupancy in Peru rose to 90%, with medical workers beginning to participate in strikes due to their harsh work conditions [124] Due to the intensity of the pandemic, the election became less of a priority for voters and many remained undecided or refused to vote outright [1]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru's gross domestic product fell 30.2 percent in the second quarter of 2020, the largest decline of all major economies, with many small service businesses that represent the majority of businesses of Peru's economy going bankrupt during the crisis [130] Medical experts commented that the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in Peru can be explained at least in part due to existing socioeconomic circumstances; nearly one-third of Peruvians lived in overcrowded homes, 72% had informal jobs requiring daily work and many needed to travel daily to markets to purchase food since only 49% of households own refrigerators or freezers; even in urban areas it is only 61% [131]\n\n\nImmigration\nAs a result of the Venezuelan refugee crisis, Peru was home to over one million Venezuelans in February 2021 [135] [136] At that time, the Peruvian Armed Forces were deployed in a joint operation with Ecuadorian counterparts to the Ecuador-Peru border to prevent the entry of illegal migrants, with the armed forces stating that it was to prevent further introduction of COVID-19 in Peru [136] Human rights organizations criticized the militarization of the border, saying that they are not properly trained for border enforcement and that it violates the human rights of migrants [136] Xenophobia towards Venezuelans in Peru has also increased, as some politicians have blamed increased crime on the migrants, although the Brookings Institution and Migration Policy Institute found that Venezuelan participate in less crime in Peru than native Peruvians [137]\n\n\nSan Miguel del Ene attack\nComrade Vilma, with close ties to Comrade José, head of the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP), a communist organization that split from Shining Path at least ten years before the San Miguel del Ene attack, [143] [144] [145] called for a boycott of elections on 14 May [146] During the second round of elections, Vilma called on voters not to vote for Fujimori, stating that anyone who voted for her would be the \"accomplice of genociders and the corrupt.\" [146]\n\n\nAnalysis\nPolitical parties in Peru have been controlled by individuals seeking their own benefits, usually financial compensation [153] According to The Economist, political graft was the largest challenge facing Peru instead of the ideological battles in the press [153] Due to the large divisions of parties in congress, with over eleven parties elected into the Congress of Peru, whoever was elected into the presidency was expected to be weak due to the fractured congress [153] Political analyst Giovanna Peñaflor agreed with the theory of a weak presidency, saying that the fragmented congress would leave the executive vulnerable to legislators [154]\n\n\nParty politics\nPolitical parties in Peru have been controlled by individuals seeking their own benefits, usually

Giovanna Peñaflor agreed with the theory of a weak presidency, saying that the fragmented congress would leave the executive vulnerable to legislators [154]\n\n\nRural vs. urban debate\nIn democratic elections since 1919, eleven of eighteen presidents of Peru were from Lima, even as many Peruvians in rural areas were not able to vote until 1979 when the constitution allowed illiterate individuals to vote [161] As globalization intensified through the twentieth century, distances between urban and rural areas increased, with larger cities increasing their ability to connect to the economy and increasing their wealth while smaller cities experienced resource and human capital flight to larger cities [1] Although economic statistics show improved economic data in Peru in recent decades, the wealth earned between 1990 and 2020 was not distributed throughout the country; living standards showed disparities between the more-developed capital city of Lima and similar coastal regions while rural provinces remained impoverished [28] [161] The COVID-19 pandemic exasperated these disparities even further, with rural Peruvians feeling a sense of abandonment by the government as trade and trans-regional travel were prohibited, fueling increased distrust and autonomy among interior regions of the nation [1] [161]\n\n\nPolarization\nDue to the internal conflict in Peru involving far-left guerrilla groups attacking Peru's institutions which mainly occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, sentiments towards left-wing political parties have a negative stigma skewed against them [144] [142] While campaigning occurred during the elections, right-wing politicians would often baselessly characterize left-wing politicians as terrorists, or terrucos in Peruvian Spanish, with the attacks being so common that they were given the term terruqueo [142] Billboards in support of Fujimori during the second round disseminated a message framing the election as being between \"freedom and dictatorship\" and \"democracy and communism\" [165]\n\n\nMedia\nDuring the intense periods of internal conflict in Peru in the 1980s and 1990s when far-left groups waged an insurgency, the government, military, and media in described any individual who was far-left on the political spectrum as being a threat to the nation, with many students, professors, union members, and peasants being jailed or killed for their political beliefs [144]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nThe first round was held on 11 April [11] [180] The first exit polls published indicated that underdog nominee Pedro Castillo of Free Peru had placed first in the first round of voting with approximately 16.1% of the vote, with Hernando de Soto and Keiko Fujimori tying with 11.9% each [180] Yonhy Lescano, Rafael López Aliaga, Verónika Mendoza, and George Forsyth followed, with each receiving 11.0%, 10.5%, 8.8%, and 6.4%, respectively [180] César Acuña and Daniel Urresti received 5.8% and 5.0%, respectively, while the rest of the nominees

and fifty observers (ninety-nine in Peru and fifty-one abroad) were approved to observe elections throughout Peru [204] The origin of the observers were from twenty-two different countries, with thirty-five observers from the Organization of American States, while others were from Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Spain, Switzerland, the United States, and Uruguay [204] Observer approval required providing election authorities observation plans; these plans included protocols to inform authorities of crimes, violations of electoral law or any complaints they collected [204] Observers were then responsible with providing an official, final report to authorities [204] According to OjoPúblico, \"the observers carry out the review of the activities of election day, ranging from the installation of the voting tables, the conditioning of the secret chambers, the conformity of the ballots, the minutes, the amphorae and any other electoral material, to the counting, the counting of the vote and the transfer of the electoral records at the end of the day.\" [204]\n\n\nMontesinos and JNE scandal\nOn 25 June, former 2001 and 2016 presidential candidate Fernando Olivera revealed audio tapes, alleging that Vladimiro Montesinos, who was the right hand man to former President Alberto Fujimori currently serving a prison sentence for crimes committed during the Fujimori period, was behind the attempts for Keiko Fujimori to be declared as the winner of the second round against Castillo, including through the payment of bribes to electoral officials and influencing the National Jury of Elections The National Penitentiary Institute and Peruvian Navy announced an investigation, confirming that Montesinos made two phone calls from Callao Naval Base where he is jailed, on 10 and 23 June to unauthorised persons coordinating the effort to overturn the election [219] [220]\n\n\nReactions\nLourdes Flores, leader of the Christian People's Party, which supported Fujimori in the election, argued carrying out her own analysis of certain electoral acts, concluding that there was a mechanism to \"improperly incline the vote\" in favor of Pedro Castillo [222] Rafael López Aliaga, former presidential candidate for Popular Renewal who supported Fujimori as well, argued that the second round or ballot should be repeated because \"there is a fraud that cannot be covered up anymore\" [223] Alfredo Barnechea, former candidate for Popular Action, affirmed that the irregularities detected were \"massive\" and that therefore the ballot should be repeated with international observation or else whoever is elected \"will not have any legitimacy.\" [224]\n\n\nDomestic\nLourdes Flores, leader of the Christian

[233] President of Bolivia Luis Arce tweeted that \"Bolivia joins the celebration of the Peruvian people\", calling Castillo his \"brother\", and stating that the two would \"continue the struggle for a tomorrow with justice and equality for the people.\" [234] Evo Morales and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former presidents of Bolivia and Brazil, respectively, also congratulated Castillo [233]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nIn late June, an IEP poll showed that thirty-one percent of participants believed in Fujimori's claims of fraud [197] A statistical analysis of the company Ipsos Peru on the results published by the National Office of Electoral Processes did not find evidence of an atypical distribution of votes to any candidate, neither in certain geographical areas nor for a particular candidate [241] In a survey carried out by Datum Internacional, 65% of respondents (both Pedro Castillo and Keiko Fujimori voters) believed that there were \"signs\" of fraud in the elections [242] [243] A survey by the Institute of Peruvian Studies showed that 66% of participants considered that Castillo had won the election [244]\n\n\nNotes\nSupporting Parties\n\n\nReferences\nSupporting

event was held in that month [60] [61] His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, and WWE President Nick Khan took over as co-CEOs, and the former also took over as Chairwoman of WWE [62] However, on January

television for the next month due to his (kayfabe) knee injury while Bobby Lashley lost the WWE Championship to Big E in the latter's Money in the Bank cash-in match [64] Goldberg returned on the October 4 episode of Raw and proclaimed that he would kill Lashley for what he did to his son Lashley stated that his attack on Gage was a misunderstanding, which Goldberg refused to believe Lashley then stated he would face Goldberg at Crown Jewel on the condition that the match was a No Holds Barred match, which Goldberg gladly accepted [65] The match was also stipulated as a Falls Count Anywhere match [66] At the event, Goldberg defeated Lashley to end the feud [67]\n\n\nSmackDown\nOn the September 10 episode of SmackDown, Brock Lesnar again appeared to confront Roman Reigns and claimed that his former advocate, Paul Heyman, who had been serving as Reigns' special counsel since August 2020, knew Lesnar would be at SummerSlam in an attempt to cause dissension between Reigns and Heyman Lesnar then challenged Heyman to accept a match against Reigns for the Universal Championship Later that night, Reigns accepted the challenge [77] On September 16, WWE announced that the match would occur at Crown Jewel [78] Before that, however, Finn Bálor received his promised championship match against Reigns at Extreme Rules where Reigns defeated Bálor, who had competed in his \"Demon\" persona, to retain the title [79] At Crown Jewel, Reigns retained after interference from The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) [67] Their next match would take place at Night 2 of WrestleMania 38 with Lesnar as WWE Champion after winning the title at Elimination Chamber The match was a Winner Takes All Championship Unification match, [80] [81] which Reigns won to claim both titles and become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion [82] They would have one further match at the following year's SummerSlam, this time as a Last Man Standing match, [83] where Reigns retained

{"title": "Spanish_flu", "content": "\nEtymologies\nThis pandemic was known by many different names—some old, some new—depending on place, time, and context The etymology of alternative names historicises the scourge and its effects on people who would only learn years later that invisible viruses caused influenza [18] The lack of scientific answers led the Sierra Leone Weekly News (Freetown) to suggest a biblical framing in July 1918, using an interrogative from Exodus 16 in ancient Hebrew: [a] \"One thing is for certain—the doctors are at present flabbergasted; and we suggest that rather than calling the disease influenza they should for the present until they have it in hand, say Man hu—'What is it?'\" [20] [21] [22]\n\n\nDescriptive names\nOutbreaks of influenza-like illness were documented in 1916–17 at British military hospitals in Étaples, France, [23] and just across the English Channel at Aldershot, England Clinical indications in common with the 1918 pandemic included rapid symptom progression to a \"dusky\" heliotrope cyanosis of the face  This characteristic blue-violet cyanosis in expiring patients led to the name 'purple death' [24] [25] [26]\n\n\nAssociative names\nMany alternative names are exonyms in the practice of making new infectious diseases seem foreign [38] [39] [40] This pattern was observed even before the 1889–1890 pandemic, also known as the 'Russian flu', when the Russians already called epidemic influenza the 'Chinese catarrh', the Germans called it the 'Russian pest', while the Italians in turn called it the 'German disease' [41] [42] These epithets were re-used in the 1918 pandemic, along with new ones [43]\n\n\n'Spanish' influenza\nOutside Spain, the disease was soon misnamed 'Spanish influenza' [44] [45] In a 2 June 1918 The Times of London dispatch titled, \"The Spanish Epidemic,\" a correspondent in Madrid reported over 100,000 victims of, \"The unknown disease…clearly of a gripal character,\" without referring to \"Spanish influenza\" directly [46] Three weeks later  The Times reported that, \"Everybody thinks of it as the 'Spanish' influenza to-day.\" [47] Three days after that an advertisement appeared in The Times for Formamint tablets to prevent \"Spanish influenza\" [48] [49] When it reached Moscow, Pravda announced, \"Ispánka (the Spanish lady) is in town,\" making 'the Spanish lady' another common name [50]\n\n\nOther exonyms\nFrench press initially used 'American flu', but adopted 'Spanish flu' in lieu of antagonizing an ally [58] In the spring of 1918, British soldiers called it 'Flanders flu', while German soldiers used 'Flandern-Fieber' (Flemish fever), both after a famous battlefield in Belgium where many soldiers on both sides fell ill [43] [40] [59] [60] In Senegal it was named 'Brazilian flu', and in Brazil, 'German flu' [61] In Spain it was also known as the 'French flu' (gripe francesa), [51] [9] or the 'Naples Soldier' (Soldado de Nápoles), after a popular song from a zarzuela [b] [58] Spanish flu (gripe española) is now a common name in Spain, [63] but remains controversial there [64] [65]\n\n\nLocal names\nSome language endonyms did not name specific regions or groups of people Examples specific to this pandemic include: Northern Ndebele: 'Malibuzwe' (let enquiries be made concerning it), Swahili: 'Ugonjo huo kichwa na kukohoa na kiuno' (the disease of head and coughing and spine), [77] Yao: 'chipindupindu' (disease from seeking to make a profit in wartime), Otjiherero: 'kaapitohanga' (disease which passes through like a bullet), [78] and Persian: nakhushi-yi bad (disease of the wind) [79] [80]\n\n\nOther names\nThis outbreak was also commonly known as the 'great influenza epidemic', [81] [82] after the 'great war', a common name for World War I before World War II [83] French military doctors originally called it 'disease 11' (maladie onze) [40] German doctors downplayed the severity by calling it 'pseudo influenza' (Latin: pseudo, false), while in Africa, doctors tried to get patients to take it more seriously by calling it 'influenza vera' (Latin: vera, true) [84]\n\n\nHistory\nThe pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston in Kansas, United States, despite there having been cases before him [91] The disease had already been observed 200 miles (320 km) away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the editors of the U.S Public Health Service's academic journal Public Health Reports [83] Within days of the 4 March first case at Camp Funston, 522 men at the camp had reported sick [92] By 11 March 1918, the virus had reached Queens, New York [93] Failure to take preventive measures in March/April was later criticized [94]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of

Kansas, United States, despite there having been cases before him [91] The disease had already been observed 200 miles (320 km) away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor

sick [92] By 11 March 1918, the virus had reached Queens, New York [93] Failure to take preventive measures in March/April was later criticized [94]\n\n\nDeadly second wave of late 1918\nThe second wave began in the second half of August 1918, probably spreading to Boston, Massachusetts and Freetown, Sierra Leone, by ships from Brest, where it had likely arrived with American troops or French recruits for naval training [101] From the Boston Navy Yard and Camp Devens (later renamed Fort Devens), about 30 miles west of Boston, other U.S military sites were soon afflicted, as were troops being transported to Europe [102] Helped by troop movements, it spread over the next two months to all of North America, and then to Central and South America, also reaching Brazil and the Caribbean on ships [103] In July 1918, the Ottoman Empire saw its first cases in some soldiers [104] From Freetown, the pandemic continued to spread through West Africa along the coast, rivers, and the colonial railways, and from railheads to more remote communities, while South Africa received it in September on ships bringing back members of the South African Native Labour Corps returning from France [103] From there it spread around southern Africa and beyond the Zambezi, reaching Ethiopia in November [105] On 15 September, New York City saw its first fatality from influenza [106] The Philadelphia Liberty Loans Parade, held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 28 September 1918 to promote government bonds for World War I, resulted in 12,000 deaths after a major outbreak of the illness spread among people who had attended the parade [107]\n\n\nThird wave of 1919\nPandemic activity persisted, in general, into 1919 in many places This persistence in activity is possibly attributable to climate, specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, where it was winter and thus the usual time for influenza activity [112] [113] The pandemic nonetheless continued into 1919 largely independent of region and climate [112]\n\n\nFourth wave of 1920\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, fears of a \"recurrence\" of the flu grew as fall approached Experts cited the history of past flu epidemics, such as that of 1889–1890, to predict that such a recurrence a year later was not unlikely, [138] [139] though not all agreed [140] In September 1919, U.S Surgeon General Rupert Blue said a return of the flu later in the year would \"probably, but by no means certainly,\" occur [141] France had readied a public information campaign before the end of the summer, [142] and Britain began preparations in the autumn with the manufacture of vaccine [143]\n\n\nPost-pandemic\nBy mid-1920, the pandemic was largely considered to be \"over\" by the public as well as governments [169] Though parts of Chile experienced a third, milder wave between November 1920 and March 1921, [135] the flu seemed to be mostly absent through the winter of 1920–1921 [117]: 167  In the United States, for example, deaths from pneumonia and influenza were \"very much lower than for many years\" [117]: 167 \n\n\nPotential origins\nDespite its name, historical and epidemiological data cannot identify the geographic origin of the Spanish flu [2] However, several theories have been proposed.\n\n\nUnited States\nThe first confirmed cases originated in the United States Historian Alfred W Crosby stated in 2003 that the flu originated in Kansas, [177] and author John M Barry described a January 1918 outbreak in Haskell County, Kansas, as the point of origin in his 2004 article [83]\n\n\nEurope\nThe major U.K troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples in France has been theorized by virologist John Oxford as being at the center of the Spanish flu [180] His study found that in late 1916 the Étaples camp was hit by the onset of a new disease with high mortality that caused symptoms similar to the flu [181] [180] According to Oxford, a similar outbreak occurred in March 1917 at army barracks in Aldershot, [182] and military pathologists later recognized these early outbreaks as the same disease as the Spanish flu [183] [180] The overcrowded camp and hospital at Étaples was an ideal environment for the spread of a respiratory virus.\n\n\nChina\nIn 1993, Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the Spanish flu at the Pasteur Institute, asserted the precursor virus was likely to have come from China and then mutated in the United States near Boston and from there spread to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, the rest of Europe, and the rest of the world, with Allied soldiers and sailors as the main disseminators [186] Hannoun considered several alternative hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely [186]\n\n\nEpidemiology and pathology\nThe basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3 [195] The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation The war may also have reduced people's resistance to the virus Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility [196] [197] A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of the flu was increased travel Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease [198] Another was lies and denial by governments, leaving the population ill-prepared to handle the outbreaks [199]\n\n\nTransmission and mutation\nThe basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3 [195] The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented

civilian travelers to spread the disease [198] Another was lies and denial by governments, leaving the population ill-prepared to handle the outbreaks [199]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nThe majority of the infected experienced only the typical flu symptoms of sore throat, headache, and fever, especially during the first wave [205] However, during the second wave, the disease was much more serious, often complicated by bacterial pneumonia, which was often the cause of death [205] This more serious type would cause heliotrope cyanosis to develop, whereby the skin would first develop two mahogany spots over the cheekbones which would then over a few hours spread to color the entire face blue, followed by black coloration first in the extremities and then further spreading to the limbs and the torso [205] After this, death would follow within hours or days due to the lungs being filled with fluids [205] Other signs and symptoms reported included spontaneous mouth and nosebleeds, miscarriages for pregnant women, a peculiar smell, teeth and hair falling out, delirium, dizziness, insomnia, loss of hearing or smell, and impaired vision [205] One observer wrote, \"One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred\" [206]\n\n\nMisdiagnosis\nBecause the virus that caused the disease was too small to be seen under a microscope at the time, there were problems with correctly diagnosing it [212] The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae was instead mistakenly thought to be the cause, as it was big enough to be seen and was present in many, though not all, patients [212] For this reason, a vaccine that was used against that bacillus did not make an infection rarer but did decrease the death rate [213]\n\n\nThe role of climate conditions\nStudies have shown that the immune system of Spanish flu victims could have been weakened by adverse climate conditions which were particularly unseasonably cold and wet for extended periods of time during the duration of the pandemic This affected especially WWI troops exposed to incessant rains and lower-than-average temperatures for the duration of the conflict, and especially during the second wave of the pandemic Ultra-high-resolution climate data combined with highly detailed mortality records analyzed at Harvard University and the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine identified a severe climate anomaly that impacted Europe from 1914 to 1919, with several environmental indicators directly influencing the severity and spread of the Spanish flu pandemic [11] Specifically, a significant increase in precipitation affected all of Europe during the second wave of the pandemic, from September to December 1918 Mortality figures follow closely the concurrent increase in precipitation and decrease in temperatures Several explanations have been proposed for this, including the fact that lower temperatures and increased precipitation provided ideal conditions for virus replication and transmission, while also negatively affecting the immune systems of soldiers and other people exposed to the inclement weather, a factor proven to increase likelihood of infection by both viruses and pneumococcal co-morbid infections documented to have affected a large percentage of pandemic victims (one fifth of them, with a 36% mortality rate) [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] A six-year climate anomaly (1914–1919) brought cold, marine air to Europe, drastically changing its weather, as documented by eyewitness accounts and instrumental records, reaching as far as the Gallipoli campaign, in Turkey, where ANZAC troops suffered extremely cold temperatures despite the normally Mediterranean climate of the region The climate anomaly likely influenced the migration of H1N1 avian vectors which contaminate bodies of water with their droppings, reaching 60% infection rates in autumn [220] [221] [222] The climate anomaly has been associated with an anthropogenic increase in atmospheric dust, due to the incessant bombardment; increased nucleation due to dust particles (cloud condensation nuclei) contributed to increased precipitation [223] [224] [225]\n\n\nResponses\nWhile systems for alerting public health authorities of infectious spread did exist in 1918, they did not generally include influenza, leading to a delayed response [228] Nevertheless, actions were taken Maritime quarantines were declared on islands such as Iceland, Australia, and American Samoa, saving many lives [228] Social distancing measures were introduced, for example closing schools, theatres, and places of worship, limiting public transportation, and banning mass gatherings [229] Wearing face masks became common in some places, such as Japan, though there were debates over their efficacy [229] [230] There was also some resistance to their use, as exemplified by the Anti-Mask League of San Francisco Vaccines were also developed, but as these were based on bacteria and not the actual virus, they could only help with secondary infections [229] The actual enforcement of various restrictions varied [231] To a large extent, the New York City health commissioner ordered businesses to open and close on staggered shifts to avoid overcrowding on the subways [232]\n\n\nPublic health management\nWhile systems for alerting public health authorities of infectious spread did exist in 1918, they did not generally include influenza, leading to a

New York City health commissioner ordered businesses to open and close on staggered shifts to avoid overcrowding on the subways [232]\n\n\nMedical treatment\nAs there were no antiviral drugs to treat the virus, and no antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections, doctors would rely on a random assortment of medicines with varying degrees of effectiveness, such as aspirin, quinine, arsenics, digitalis, strychnine, epsom salts, castor oil, and iodine [234] Treatments of traditional medicine, such as bloodletting, ayurveda, and kampo were also applied [235]\n\n\nInformation dissemination\nDue to World War I, many countries engaged in wartime censorship, and suppressed reporting of the pandemic [236] For example, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera was prohibited from reporting daily death tolls [237] The newspapers of the time were also generally paternalistic and worried about mass panic [237] Misinformation also spread along with the disease In Ireland there was a belief that noxious gases were rising from the mass graves of Flanders Fields and being \"blown all over the world by winds\" [238] There were also rumors that the Germans were behind it, for example by poisoning the aspirin manufactured by Bayer, or by releasing poison gas from U-boats [239]\n\n\nMortality\nThe Spanish flu infected around 500 million people, about one-third of the world's population [2] Estimates as to how many infected people died vary greatly, but the flu is regardless considered to be one of the deadliest pandemics in history [242] [243] An early estimate from 1927 put global mortality at 21.6 million [4] An estimate from 1991 states that the virus killed between 25 and 39 million people [98] A 2005 estimate put the death toll at 50 million (about 3% of the global population), and possibly as high as 100 million (more than 5%) [206] [244] However, a 2018 reassessment in the American Journal of Epidemiology estimated the total to be about 17 million, [4] though this has been contested [245] With a world population of 1.8 to 1.9 billion, [246] these estimates correspond to between 1 and 6 percent of the population.\n\n\nAround the globe\nThe Spanish flu infected around 500 million people, about one-third of the world's population [2] Estimates as to how many infected people died vary greatly, but the flu is regardless considered to be one of the deadliest pandemics in history [242] [243] An early estimate from 1927 put global mortality at 21.6 million [4] An estimate from 1991 states that the virus killed between

reassessment in the American Journal of Epidemiology estimated the total to be about 17 million, [4] though this has been contested [245] With a world population of 1.8 to 1.9 billion, [246] these estimates correspond to between 1 and 6 percent of the population.\n\n\nDevastated communities\nEven in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside There were reports that healthcare workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places [276]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn the Pacific, American Samoa [287] and the French colony of New Caledonia [288] succeeded in preventing even a single death from influenza through effective quarantines However, the outbreak was delayed into 1926 for American Samoa and 1921 for New Caledonia as the quarantine period ended [289] On American Samoa, at least 25% of the island residents were clinically attacked and 0.1% died, and on New Caledonia, there was widespread illness and 0.1% population died [289] Australia also managed to avoid the first two waves with a quarantine [228] Iceland protected a third of its population from exposure by blocking the main road of the island [228] By the end of the pandemic, the isolated island of Marajó, in Brazil's Amazon River Delta had not reported an outbreak [290] Saint Helena also reported no deaths [291]\n\n\nPatterns of fatality\nThe pandemic mostly killed young adults In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S occurred in people under 65, and nearly half of deaths were in young adults 20 to 40 years old In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but 92% of deaths still occurred in people under 65 [300] This is unusual since influenza is typically most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants under age two, adults over age 70, and the immunocompromised In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the \"Russian flu\" [301] According to historian John M Barry, the most vulnerable of all – \"those most likely, of the most likely\", to die – were pregnant women He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic, the death rate ranged from 23% to 71% [302] Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth, over one-quarter (26%) lost the child [303] Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn (in the Northern Hemisphere); influenza is usually worse in winter [304]\n\n\nEffects\nAcademic Andrew Price-Smith has made the argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the latter days of the war towards the Allied cause He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before the Allied powers and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France [185] A 2006 Lancet study corroborates higher excess mortality rates in Germany (0.76%) and Austria (1.61%) compared to Britain (0.34%) and France (0.75%) [252]\n\n\nWorld War I\nAcademic Andrew Price-Smith has made the argument that the virus helped tip the

Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France [185] A 2006 Lancet study corroborates higher excess mortality rates in Germany (0.76%) and Austria (1.61%) compared to Britain (0.34%) and France (0.75%) [252]\n\n\nEconomic\nMany businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains [311] Historian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness Nursing staff, who were mainly women, celebrated the success of their patient care and did not associate the spread of the disease with their work [312]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nA 2006 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that \"cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments received compared with other birth cohorts.\" [316] A 2018 study found that the pandemic reduced educational attainment in populations [317] The flu has also been linked to the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s [318]\n\n\nLegacy\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about bird flu and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s [320] [321] This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a \"forgotten pandemic\" [177] However, this label has been challenged by the historian Guy Beiner, who has charted a complex history of social and cultural forgetting, demonstrating how the pandemic was overshadowed by the commemoration of the First World War and mostly neglected in mainstream historiography, yet was remembered in private and local traditions across the globe [321]\n\n\nIn literature and other media\nDespite the toll of the pandemic, it was never a large theme in American literature [325] Alfred Crosby suspects that it may be due to the fact that it occurred after World War I, which was the most important event in that generation's lives [326] Katherine Anne Porter's 1939 novella Pale Horse, Pale Rider is one of the most well-known fictional accounts of the pandemic [325] The 2006 novel The Last Town on Earth focuses on a town which attempts to limit the spread of the flu by preventing people from entering or leaving [327] The Pull of the Stars is a 2020 novel by Emma Donoghue set in Dublin during the Spanish flu Its final draft was submitted in March 2020, and publishers fast-tracked publication because of the then ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [328]\n\n\nComparison with other pandemics\nThe Spanish flu killed a much lower percentage of the world's population than the Black Death, which lasted for many more years [329]\n\n\nResearch\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease [354] Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans [355] [356]\n\n\nSex differences in mortality\nThe high mortality rate of the influenza pandemic is one aspect that sets the pandemic apart from other disease outbreaks Another factor is the higher mortality rate of men compared with women Men with an underlying condition were at significantly more risk Tuberculosis was one of the deadliest diseases in the 1900s, and killed more men than women But with the spread of influenza disease, the cases of tuberculosis cases in men decreased Many scholars have noted that tuberculosis increased the mortality rate of influenza in males, decreasing their life expectancy During the 1900s tuberculosis was more common in males than females, but studies show that when influenza spread the tuberculosis mortality rate among females changed The death rate of tuberculosis in females increased significantly and would continue to decline until post-pandemic [375]\n\n\nIsland of Newfoundland\nOne major cause of the spread of influenza was social behavior Men had more social variation and were mobile more than women due to their work Even though there was a higher mortality rate in males, each region showed different results, due to such factors as nutritional deficiency In Newfoundland, the pandemic spread was highly variable Influenza did not discriminate who was infected, indeed it attacked the socioeconomic status of people Although social variability allowed the disease to move quickly geographically, it tended to spread faster and affect men more than women due to labor and social contact Newfoundland's leading cause of death before the pandemic was tuberculosis and this is known to be a severe underlying condition for people and increases the |mortality rate when infected by the influenza disease There was diverse labor in Newfoundland, men and women had various occupations that involved day-to-day interaction But, fishing had a major role in the economy and so males were more mobile than females and had more contact with other parts of the world The spread of the pandemic is known to have begun in the spring of 1918, but Newfoundland did not see the deadly wave until June or July, which aligns with the high demand for employment in the fishery The majority of men were working along the coast during the summer and it was typical for entire families to move to Newfoundland and work Studies show a much higher mortality rate in males compared with females But, during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic, the mortality shifted During the first wave, men had a higher mortality rate, but the mortality rate of females increased and was higher during the second and third waves The female population was larger in certain regions of Newfoundland and therefore had a bigger impact on the death rate [377]\n\n\nInfluenza pandemic among Canadian soldiers\nRecords indicate the most deaths during the first wave of the pandemic were among young men in their 20s, which reflects the age of enlistment in the war. The mobility of young men during 1918 was linked to the spread of influenza and the biggest wave of the epidemic. In late 1917 and throughout 1918, thousands of male troops gathered at the Halifax port before heading to Europe Any soldier that was ill and could not depart was added to the population of Halifax, which increased the case rate of influenza among men during the war To determine the cause of the death during the pandemic, war scientists used the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which reported under 2 million men and women died during the wars, with a record of those who died from 1917 to 1918 The movement of soldiers during this time and the transportation from United States between Canada likely had a significant effect on the spread of the pandemic [378]\n\n\nSee

Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, was a global outbreak that occurred in 1918-1919. It is considered one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history, killing an estimated 50 million people worldwide.\n\n**Etymologies**\n\nThe pandemic was known by many different names, depending on place, time, and context. The etymology of alternative names historicizes the scourge and its effects on people who would only learn years later that invisible viruses caused influenza. The lack of scientific answers led the Sierra Leone Weekly News (Freetown) to suggest a biblical framing in July 1918, using an interrogative from Exodus 16 in ancient Hebrew: \"One thing is for certain—the doctors are at present flabbergasted; and we suggest that rather than calling the disease influenza they should for the present until they have it in hand, say Man hu—'What is it?'\"\n\n**Descriptive names**\n\nOutbreaks of influenza-like illness were documented in 1916-17 at British military hospitals in Étaples, France, and just across the English Channel at Aldershot, England. Clinical indications in common with the 1918 pandemic included rapid symptom progression to a \"dusky\" heliotrope cyanosis of the face. This characteristic blue-violet cyanosis in expiring patients led to the name 'purple death'.\n\n**Associative names**\n\nMany alternative names are exonyms in the practice of making new infectious diseases seem foreign. This pattern was observed even before the 1889-1890 pandemic, also known as the 'Russian flu', when the Russians already called epidemic influenza the 'Chinese catarrh', the Germans called it the 'Russian pest', while the Italians in turn called it the 'German disease'. These epithets were re-used in the 1918 pandemic, along with new ones.\n\n**'Spanish' influenza**\n\nOutside Spain, the disease was soon misnamed 'Spanish influenza'. A 2 June 1918 The Times of London dispatch titled, \"The Spanish Epidemic,\" reported over 100,000 victims of, \"The unknown disease…clearly of a gripal character,\" without referring to \"Spanish influenza\" directly. Three weeks later, The Times reported that, \"Everybody thinks of it as the 'Spanish' influenza to-day.\" Three days after that an advertisement appeared in The Times for Formamint tablets to prevent \"Spanish influenza\".\n\n**Other exonyms**\n\nFrench press initially used 'American flu', but adopted 'Spanish flu' in lieu of antagonizing an ally. In the spring of 1918, British soldiers called it 'Flanders flu', while German soldiers used 'Flandern-Fieber' (Flemish fever), both after a famous battlefield in Belgium where many soldiers on both sides fell ill. In Senegal it was named 'Brazilian flu', and in Brazil, 'German flu'. In Spain it was also known as the 'French flu' (gripe francesa), after a popular song from a zarzuela.\n\n**Local names**\n\nSome language endonyms did not name specific regions or groups of people. Examples specific to this pandemic include: Northern Ndebele: 'Malibuzwe' (let enquiries be made concerning it), Swahili: 'Ugonjo huo kichwa na kukohoa na kiuno' (the disease of head and coughing and spine), Yao: 'chipindupindu' (disease from seeking to make a profit in wartime), Otjiherero: 'kaapitohanga' (disease which passes through like a bullet), and Persian: nakhushi-yi bad (disease of the wind).\n\n**History**\n\nThe pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston in Kansas, United States. The disease had already been observed 200 miles (320 km) away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the editors of the U.S Public Health Service's academic journal Public Health Reports. Within days of the 4 March first case at Camp Funston, 522 men at the camp had reported sick.\n\n**First wave of early 1918**\n\nThe pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston in Kansas, United States. The disease had already been observed 200 miles (320 km) away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the editors of the U.S Public Health Service's academic journal Public Health Reports. Within days of the 4 March first case at Camp Funston, 522 men at the camp had reported sick.\n\n**Deadly second wave of late 1918**\n\nThe second wave began in the second half of August 1918, probably spreading to Boston, Massachusetts and Freetown, Sierra Leone, by ships from Brest, where it had likely arrived with American troops or French recruits for naval training. From the Boston Navy Yard and Camp Devens (later renamed Fort Devens), about 30 miles west of Boston, other U.S military sites were soon afflicted, as were troops being transported to Europe.\n\n**Third wave of 1919**\n\nPandemic activity persisted, in general, into 1919 in many places. This persistence in activity is possibly attributable to climate, specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, where it was winter and thus the usual time for influenza activity.\n\n**Fourth wave of 1920**\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, fears of a \"recurrence\" of the flu grew as fall approached. Experts cited the history of past flu epidemics, such as that of 1889-1890, to predict that such a recurrence a year later was not unlikely.\n\n**Post-pandemic**\n\nBy mid-1920, the pandemic was largely considered to be \"over\" by the public as well as governments. Though parts of Chile experienced a third, milder wave between November 1920 and March 1921, the flu seemed to be mostly absent through the winter of 1920-1921.\n\n**Potential origins**\n\nDespite its name, historical and epidemiological data cannot identify the geographic origin of the Spanish flu. However, several theories have been proposed.\n\n**United States**\n\nThe first confirmed cases originated in the United States. Historian Alfred W Crosby stated in 2003 that the flu originated in Kansas, and author John M Barry described a January 1918 outbreak in Haskell County, Kansas, as the point of origin in his 2004 article.\n\n**Europe**\n\nThe major U.K troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples in France has been theorized by virologist John Oxford as being at the center of the Spanish flu. His study found that in late 1916 the Étaples camp was hit by the onset of a new disease with high mortality that caused symptoms similar to the flu.\n\n**China**\n\nIn 1993, Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the Spanish flu at the Pasteur Institute, asserted the precursor virus was likely to have come from China and then mutated in the United States near Boston and from there spread to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, the rest of Europe, and the rest of the world.\n\n**Epidemiology and pathology**\n\nThe basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation. The war may also have reduced people's resistance to the virus.\n\n**Transmission and mutation**\n\nThe basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation. The war may also have reduced people's resistance to the virus.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nThe majority of the infected experienced only the typical flu symptoms of sore throat, headache, and fever, especially during the first wave. However, during the second wave, the disease was much more serious, often complicated by bacterial pneumonia, which was often the cause of death.\n\n**Misdiagnosis**\n\nBecause the virus that caused the disease was too small to be seen under a microscope at the time, there were problems with correctly diagnosing it. The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae was instead mistakenly thought to be the cause, as it was big enough to be seen and was present in many, though not all, patients.\n\n**The role of climate conditions**\n\nStudies have shown that the immune system of Spanish flu victims could have been weakened by adverse climate conditions which were particularly unseasonably cold and wet for extended periods of time during the duration of the pandemic.\n\n**Medical treatment**\n\nAs there were no antiviral drugs to treat the virus, and no antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections, doctors would rely on a random assortment of medicines with varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\n**Information dissemination**\n\nDue to World War I, many countries engaged in wartime censorship, and suppressed reporting of the pandemic. For example, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera was prohibited from reporting daily death tolls.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nThe Spanish flu infected around 500 million people, about one-third of the world's population. Estimates as to how many infected people died vary greatly, but the flu is regardless considered to be one of the deadliest pandemics in history.\n\n**Devastated communities**\n\nEven in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside.\n\n**Other areas**\n\nIn the Pacific, American Samoa and the French colony of New Caledonia succeeded in preventing even a single death from influenza through effective quarantines.\n\n**Patterns of fatality**\n\nThe pandemic mostly killed young adults. In 1918-1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S occurred in people under 65, and nearly half of deaths were in young adults 20 to 40 years old.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe pandemic has had long-lasting effects on the world. A 2006 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that \"cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments received compared with other birth cohorts.\"\n\n**Legacy**\n\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about bird flu and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n**In literature and other media**\n\nThe pandemic has been depicted in various forms of media, including literature, film, and art.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Spanish_flu\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymologies\nThis pandemic was known by many different names—some old, some new—depending on place, time, and context The etymology of alternative names historicises the scourge and its effects on people who would only learn years later that invisible viruses caused influenza [18] The lack of scientific answers led the Sierra Leone Weekly News (Freetown) to suggest a biblical framing in July 1918, using an interrogative from Exodus 16 in ancient Hebrew: [a] \"One thing is for certain—the doctors are at present flabbergasted; and we suggest that rather than calling the disease influenza they should for the present until they have it in hand, say Man hu—'What is it?'\" [20] [21] [22]\n\n\nDescriptive names\nOutbreaks of influenza-like illness were documented in 1916–17 at British military hospitals in Étaples, France, [23] and just across the English Channel at Aldershot, England Clinical indications in common with the 1918 pandemic included rapid symptom progression to a \"dusky\" heliotrope cyanosis of the face  This characteristic blue-violet cyanosis in expiring patients led to the name 'purple death' [24] [25] [26]\n\n\nAssociative names\nMany alternative names are exonyms in the practice of making new infectious diseases seem foreign [38] [39] [40] This pattern was observed even before the 1889–1890 pandemic, also known as the 'Russian flu', when the Russians already called epidemic influenza the 'Chinese catarrh', the Germans called it the 'Russian pest', while the Italians in turn called it the 'German disease' [41] [42] These epithets were re-used in the 1918 pandemic, along with new ones [43]\n\n\n'Spanish' influenza\nOutside Spain, the disease was soon misnamed 'Spanish influenza' [44] [45] In a 2 June 1918 The Times of London dispatch titled, \"The Spanish Epidemic,\" a correspondent in Madrid reported over 100,000 victims of, \"The unknown disease…clearly of a gripal character,\" without referring to \"Spanish influenza\" directly [46] Three weeks later  The Times reported that, \"Everybody thinks of it as the 'Spanish' influenza to-day.\" [47] Three days after that an advertisement appeared in The Times for Formamint tablets to prevent \"Spanish influenza\" [48] [49] When it reached Moscow, Pravda announced, \"Ispánka (the Spanish lady) is in town,\" making 'the Spanish lady' another common name [50]\n\n\nOther exonyms\nFrench press initially used 'American flu', but adopted 'Spanish flu' in lieu of antagonizing an ally [58] In the spring of 1918, British soldiers called it 'Flanders flu', while German soldiers used 'Flandern-Fieber' (Flemish fever), both after a famous battlefield in Belgium where many soldiers on both sides fell ill [43] [40] [59] [60] In Senegal it was named 'Brazilian flu', and in Brazil, 'German flu' [61] In Spain it was also known as the 'French flu' (gripe francesa), [51] [9] or the 'Naples Soldier' (Soldado de Nápoles), after a popular song from a zarzuela [b] [58] Spanish flu (gripe española) is now a common name in Spain, [63] but remains controversial there [64] [65]\n\n\nLocal names\nSome language endonyms did not name specific regions or groups of people Examples specific to this pandemic include: Northern Ndebele: 'Malibuzwe' (let enquiries be made concerning it), Swahili: 'Ugonjo huo kichwa na kukohoa na kiuno' (the disease of head and coughing and spine), [77] Yao: 'chipindupindu' (disease from seeking to make a profit in wartime), Otjiherero: 'kaapitohanga' (disease which passes through like a bullet), [78] and Persian: nakhushi-yi bad (disease of the wind) [79] [80]\n\n\nOther names\nThis outbreak was also commonly known as the 'great influenza epidemic', [81] [82] after the 'great war', a common name for World War I before World War II [83] French military doctors originally called it 'disease 11' (maladie onze) [40] German doctors downplayed the severity by calling it 'pseudo influenza' (Latin: pseudo, false), while in Africa, doctors tried to get patients to take it more seriously by calling it 'influenza vera' (Latin: vera, true) [84]\n\n\nHistory\nThe pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp Funston in Kansas, United States, despite there having been cases before him [91] The disease had already been observed 200 miles (320 km) away in Haskell County as early as January 1918, prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the editors of the U.S Public Health Service's academic journal Public Health Reports [83] Within days of the 4 March first case at Camp Funston, 522 men at the camp had reported sick [92] By 11 March 1918, the virus had reached Queens, New York [93] Failure to take preventive measures in March/April was later criticized [94]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe pandemic is conventionally marked as having begun on 4 March 1918 with the recording of the case of Albert Gitchell, an army cook at Camp

reached Queens, New York [93] Failure to take preventive measures in March/April was later criticized [94]\n\n\nDeadly second wave of late 1918\nThe second wave began in the second half of August 1918, probably spreading to Boston, Massachusetts and Freetown, Sierra Leone, by ships from Brest, where it had likely arrived with American troops or French recruits for naval training [101] From the Boston Navy Yard and Camp Devens (later renamed Fort Devens), about 30 miles west of Boston, other U.S military sites were soon afflicted, as were troops being transported to Europe [102] Helped by troop movements, it spread over the next two months to all of North America, and then to Central and South America, also reaching Brazil and the Caribbean on ships [103] In July 1918, the Ottoman Empire saw its first cases in some soldiers [104] From Freetown, the pandemic continued to spread through West Africa along the coast, rivers, and the colonial railways, and from railheads to more remote communities, while South Africa received it in September on ships bringing back members of the South African Native Labour Corps returning from France [103] From there it spread around southern Africa and beyond the Zambezi, reaching Ethiopia in November [105] On 15 September, New York City saw its first fatality from influenza [106] The Philadelphia Liberty Loans Parade, held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 28 September 1918 to promote government bonds for World War I, resulted in 12,000 deaths after a major outbreak of the illness spread among people who had attended the parade [107]\n\n\nThird wave of 1919\nPandemic activity persisted, in general, into 1919 in many places This persistence in activity is possibly attributable to climate, specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, where it was winter and thus the usual time for influenza activity [112] [113] The pandemic nonetheless continued into 1919 largely independent of region and climate [112]\n\n\nFourth wave of 1920\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, fears of a \"recurrence\" of the flu grew as fall approached Experts cited the history of past flu epidemics, such as that of 1889–1890, to predict that such a recurrence a year later was not unlikely, [138] [139] though not all agreed [140] In September 1919, U.S Surgeon General Rupert Blue said a return of the flu later in the year would \"probably, but by no means certainly,\" occur [141] France had readied a public information campaign before the end of the summer, [142] and Britain began preparations in the autumn with the manufacture of vaccine [143]\n\n\nPost-pandemic\nBy mid-1920, the pandemic was largely considered to be \"over\" by the public as well as governments [169] Though parts of Chile experienced a third, milder wave between November 1920 and March 1921, [135] the flu seemed to be mostly absent through the winter of 1920–1921 [117]: 167  In the United States, for example, deaths from pneumonia and influenza were \"very much lower than for many years\" [117]: 167 \n\n\nPotential origins\nDespite its name, historical and epidemiological data cannot identify the geographic origin of the Spanish flu [2] However, several theories have been proposed.\n\n\nUnited States\nThe first confirmed cases originated in the United States Historian Alfred W Crosby stated in 2003 that the flu originated in Kansas, [177] and author John M Barry described a January 1918 outbreak in Haskell County, Kansas, as the point of origin in his 2004 article [83]\n\n\nEurope\nThe major U.K troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples in France has been theorized by virologist John Oxford as being at the center of the Spanish flu [180] His study found that in late 1916 the Étaples camp was hit by the onset of a new disease with high mortality that caused symptoms similar to the flu [181] [180] According to Oxford, a similar outbreak occurred in March 1917 at army barracks in Aldershot, [182] and military pathologists later recognized these early outbreaks as the same disease as the Spanish flu [183] [180] The overcrowded camp and hospital at Étaples was an ideal environment for the spread of a respiratory virus.\n\n\nChina\nIn 1993, Claude Hannoun, the leading expert on the Spanish flu at the Pasteur Institute, asserted the precursor virus was likely to have come from China and then mutated in the United States near Boston and from there spread to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, the rest of Europe, and the rest of the world, with Allied soldiers and sailors as the main disseminators [186] Hannoun considered several alternative hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely [186]\n\n\nEpidemiology and pathology\nThe basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3 [195] The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation The war may also have reduced people's resistance to the virus Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility [196] [197] A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of the flu was increased travel Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers, sailors, and civilian travelers to spread the disease [198] Another was lies and denial by governments, leaving the population ill-prepared to handle the outbreaks [199]\n\n\nTransmission and mutation\nThe basic reproduction number of the virus was between 2 and 3 [195] The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation The war may also have reduced people's resistance to the virus Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their

spread the disease [198] Another was lies and denial by governments, leaving the population ill-prepared to handle the outbreaks [199]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nThe majority of the infected experienced only the typical flu symptoms of sore throat, headache, and fever, especially during the first wave [205] However, during the second wave, the disease was much more serious, often complicated by bacterial pneumonia, which was often the cause of death [205] This more serious type would cause heliotrope cyanosis to develop, whereby the skin would first develop two mahogany spots over the cheekbones which would then over a few hours spread to color the entire face blue, followed by black coloration first in the extremities and then further spreading to the limbs and the torso [205] After this, death would follow within hours or days due to the lungs being filled with fluids [205] Other signs and symptoms reported included spontaneous mouth and nosebleeds, miscarriages for pregnant women, a peculiar smell, teeth and hair falling out, delirium, dizziness, insomnia, loss of hearing or smell, and impaired vision [205] One observer wrote, \"One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred\" [206]\n\n\nMisdiagnosis\nBecause the virus that caused the disease was too small to be seen under a microscope at the time, there were problems with correctly diagnosing it [212] The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae was instead mistakenly thought to be the cause, as it was big enough to be seen and was present in many, though not all, patients [212] For this reason, a vaccine that was used against that bacillus did not make an infection rarer but did decrease the death rate [213]\n\n\nThe role of climate conditions\nStudies have shown that the immune system of Spanish flu victims could have been weakened by adverse climate conditions which were particularly unseasonably cold and wet for extended periods of time during the duration of the pandemic This affected especially WWI troops exposed to incessant rains and lower-than-average temperatures for the duration of the conflict, and especially during the second wave of the pandemic Ultra-high-resolution climate data combined with highly detailed mortality records analyzed at Harvard University and the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine identified a severe climate anomaly that impacted Europe from 1914 to 1919, with several environmental indicators directly influencing the severity and spread of the Spanish flu pandemic [11] Specifically, a significant increase in precipitation affected all of Europe during the second wave of the pandemic, from September to December 1918 Mortality figures follow closely the concurrent increase in precipitation and decrease in temperatures Several explanations have been proposed for this, including the fact that lower temperatures and increased precipitation provided ideal conditions for virus replication and transmission, while also negatively affecting the immune systems of soldiers and other people exposed to the inclement weather, a factor proven to increase likelihood of infection by both viruses and pneumococcal co-morbid infections documented to have affected a large percentage of pandemic victims (one fifth of them, with a 36% mortality rate) [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] A six-year climate anomaly (1914–1919) brought cold, marine air to Europe, drastically changing its weather, as documented by eyewitness accounts and instrumental records, reaching as far as the Gallipoli campaign, in Turkey, where ANZAC troops suffered extremely cold temperatures despite the normally Mediterranean climate of the region The climate anomaly likely influenced the migration of H1N1 avian vectors which contaminate bodies of water with their droppings, reaching 60% infection rates in autumn [220] [221] [222] The climate anomaly has been associated with an anthropogenic increase in atmospheric dust, due to the incessant bombardment; increased nucleation due to dust particles (cloud condensation nuclei) contributed to increased precipitation [223] [224] [225]\n\n\nResponses\nWhile systems for alerting public health authorities of infectious spread did exist in 1918, they did not generally include influenza, leading to a delayed response [228] Nevertheless, actions were taken Maritime quarantines were declared on islands such as Iceland, Australia, and American Samoa, saving many lives [228] Social distancing measures were introduced, for example closing schools, theatres, and places of worship, limiting public transportation, and banning mass gatherings [229] Wearing face masks became common in some places, such as Japan, though there were debates over their efficacy [229] [230] There was also some resistance to their use, as exemplified by the Anti-Mask League of San Francisco Vaccines were also developed, but as these were based on bacteria and not the actual virus, they could only help with secondary infections [229] The actual enforcement of various restrictions varied [231] To a large extent, the New York City health commissioner ordered businesses to open and close on staggered shifts to avoid overcrowding on the subways [232]\n\n\nPublic health management\nWhile systems for alerting public health authorities of infectious spread did exist in 1918, they did not generally include influenza, leading to a

New York City health commissioner ordered businesses to open and close on staggered shifts to avoid overcrowding on the subways [232]\n\n\nMedical treatment\nAs there were no antiviral drugs to treat the virus, and no antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections, doctors would rely on a random assortment of medicines with varying degrees of effectiveness, such as aspirin, quinine, arsenics, digitalis, strychnine, epsom salts, castor oil, and iodine [234] Treatments of traditional medicine, such as bloodletting, ayurveda, and kampo were also applied [235]\n\n\nInformation dissemination\nDue to World War I, many countries engaged in wartime censorship, and suppressed reporting of the pandemic [236] For example, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera was prohibited from reporting daily death tolls [237] The newspapers of the time were also generally paternalistic and worried about mass panic [237] Misinformation also spread along with the disease In Ireland there was a belief that noxious gases were rising from the mass graves of Flanders Fields and being \"blown all over the world by winds\" [238] There were also rumors that the Germans were behind it, for example by poisoning the aspirin manufactured by Bayer, or by releasing poison gas from U-boats [239]\n\n\nMortality\nThe Spanish flu infected around 500 million people, about one-third of the world's population [2] Estimates as to how many infected people died vary greatly, but the flu is regardless considered to be one of the deadliest pandemics in history [242] [243] An early estimate from 1927 put global mortality at 21.6 million [4] An estimate from 1991 states that the virus killed between 25 and 39 million people [98] A 2005 estimate put the death toll at 50 million (about 3% of the global population), and possibly as high as 100 million (more than 5%) [206] [244] However, a 2018 reassessment in the American Journal of Epidemiology estimated the total to be about 17 million, [4] though this has been contested [245] With a world population of 1.8 to 1.9 billion, [246] these estimates correspond to between 1 and 6 percent of the population.\n\n\nAround the globe\nThe Spanish flu infected around 500 million people, about one-third of the world's population [2] Estimates as to how many infected people died vary greatly, but the flu is regardless considered to be one of the deadliest pandemics in history [242] [243] An early estimate from 1927 put global mortality at 21.6 million [4] An estimate from 1991 states that the virus killed between 25 and 39 million people [98] A 2005 estimate put the death toll at 50 million (about 3% of the global population), and possibly as high as 100 million (more than 5%) [206] [244] However, a 2018

estimates correspond to between 1 and 6 percent of the population.\n\n\nDevastated communities\nEven in areas where mortality was low, so many adults were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside There were reports that healthcare workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places [276]\n\n\nOther areas\nIn the Pacific, American Samoa [287] and the French colony of New Caledonia [288] succeeded in preventing even a single death from influenza through effective quarantines However, the outbreak was delayed into 1926 for American Samoa and 1921 for New Caledonia as the quarantine period ended [289] On American Samoa, at least 25% of the island residents were clinically attacked and 0.1% died, and on New Caledonia, there was widespread illness and 0.1% population died [289] Australia also managed to avoid the first two waves with a quarantine [228] Iceland protected a third of its population from exposure by blocking the main road of the island [228] By the end of the pandemic, the isolated island of Marajó, in Brazil's Amazon River Delta had not reported an outbreak [290] Saint Helena also reported no deaths [291]\n\n\nPatterns of fatality\nThe pandemic mostly killed young adults In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S occurred in people under 65, and nearly half of deaths were in young adults 20 to 40 years old In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but 92% of deaths still occurred in people under 65 [300] This is unusual since influenza is typically most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants under age two, adults over age 70, and the immunocompromised In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the \"Russian flu\" [301] According to historian John M Barry, the most vulnerable of all – \"those most likely, of the most likely\", to die – were pregnant women He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic, the death rate ranged from 23% to 71% [302] Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth, over one-quarter (26%) lost the child [303] Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn (in the Northern Hemisphere); influenza is usually worse in winter [304]\n\n\nEffects\nAcademic Andrew Price-Smith has made the argument that the virus helped tip the balance of power in the latter days of the war towards the Allied cause He provides data that the viral waves hit the Central Powers before the Allied powers and that both morbidity and mortality in Germany and Austria were considerably higher than in Britain and France [185] A 2006 Lancet study corroborates higher excess mortality rates in Germany (0.76%) and Austria (1.61%) compared to Britain (0.34%) and France (0.75%) [252]\n\n\nWorld War I\nAcademic Andrew Price-Smith has made the argument that the virus helped tip the

(0.34%) and France (0.75%) [252]\n\n\nEconomic\nMany businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains [311] Historian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness Nursing staff, who were mainly women, celebrated the success of their patient care and did not associate the spread of the disease with their work [312]\n\n\nLong-term effects\nA 2006 study in the Journal of Political Economy found that \"cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments received compared with other birth cohorts.\" [316] A 2018 study found that the pandemic reduced educational attainment in populations [317] The flu has also been linked to the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s [318]\n\n\nLegacy\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about bird flu and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s [320] [321] This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a \"forgotten pandemic\" [177] However, this label has been challenged by the historian Guy Beiner, who has charted a complex history of social and cultural forgetting, demonstrating how the pandemic was overshadowed by the commemoration of the First World War and mostly neglected in mainstream historiography, yet was remembered in private and local traditions across the globe [321]\n\n\nIn literature and other media\nDespite the toll of the pandemic, it was never a large theme in American literature [325] Alfred Crosby suspects that it may be due to the fact that it occurred after World War I, which was the most important event in that generation's lives [326] Katherine Anne Porter's 1939 novella Pale Horse, Pale Rider is one of the most well-known fictional accounts of the pandemic [325] The 2006 novel The Last Town on Earth focuses on a town which attempts to limit the spread of the flu by preventing people from entering or leaving [327] The Pull of the Stars is a 2020 novel by Emma Donoghue set in Dublin during the Spanish flu Its final draft was submitted in March 2020, and publishers fast-tracked publication because of the then ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [328]\n\n\nComparison with other pandemics\nThe Spanish flu killed a much lower percentage of the world's population than the Black Death, which lasted for many more years [329]\n\n\nResearch\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease [354] Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans [355] [356]\n\n\nSex differences in mortality\nThe high mortality rate of the influenza pandemic is one aspect that sets the pandemic apart from other disease outbreaks Another factor is the higher mortality rate of men compared with women Men with an underlying condition were at significantly more risk Tuberculosis was one of the deadliest diseases in the 1900s, and killed more men than women But with the spread of influenza disease, the cases of tuberculosis cases in men decreased Many scholars have noted that tuberculosis increased the mortality rate of influenza in males, decreasing their life expectancy During the 1900s tuberculosis was more common in males than females, but studies show that when influenza spread the tuberculosis mortality rate among females changed The death rate of tuberculosis in females increased significantly and would continue to decline until post-pandemic [375]\n\n\nIsland of Newfoundland\nOne major cause of the spread of influenza was social behavior Men had more social variation and were mobile more than women due to their work Even though there was a higher mortality rate in males, each region showed different results, due to such factors as nutritional deficiency In Newfoundland, the pandemic spread was highly variable Influenza did not discriminate who was infected, indeed it attacked the socioeconomic status of people Although social variability allowed the disease to move quickly geographically, it tended to spread faster and affect men more than women due to labor and social contact Newfoundland's leading cause of death before the pandemic was tuberculosis and this is known to be a severe underlying condition for people and increases the |mortality rate when infected by the influenza disease There was diverse labor in Newfoundland, men and women had various occupations that involved day-to-day interaction But, fishing had a major role in the economy and so males were more mobile than females and had more contact with other parts of the world The spread of the pandemic is known to have begun in the spring of 1918, but Newfoundland did not see the deadly wave until June or July, which aligns with the high demand for employment in the fishery The majority of men were working along the coast during the summer and it was typical for entire families to move to Newfoundland and work Studies show a much higher mortality rate in males compared with females But, during the first, second, and third waves of the pandemic, the mortality shifted During the first wave, men had a higher mortality rate, but the mortality rate of females increased and was higher during the second and third waves The female population was larger in certain regions of Newfoundland and therefore had a bigger impact on the death rate [377]\n\n\nInfluenza pandemic among Canadian soldiers\nRecords indicate the most deaths during the first wave of the pandemic were among young men in their 20s, which reflects the age of enlistment in the war. The mobility of young men during 1918 was linked to the spread of influenza and the biggest wave of the epidemic. In late 1917 and throughout 1918, thousands of male troops gathered at the Halifax port before heading to Europe Any soldier that was ill and could not depart was added to the population of Halifax, which increased the case rate of influenza among men during the war To determine the cause of the death during the pandemic, war scientists used the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which reported under 2 million men and women died during the wars, with a record of those who died from 1917 to 1918 The movement of soldiers during this time and the transportation from United States between Canada likely had a significant effect on the spread of the pandemic [378]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Nikola_Tesla", "content": "\nEarly years\nNikola Tesla was born into an ethnic Serb family in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia), on 10 July 1856 [9] [10] His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), [11] was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church [12] [13] [14] [15] His father's brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics [11]\n\n\nWorking at Budapest Telephone Exchange\nTesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described [31] [better source needed]\n\n\nWorking at Edison\nIn 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company [41] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors [42] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.\n\n\nMoving to the United States\nIn 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well [44] In June 1884, Tesla emigrated [45] and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city [46] As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators [47] Historian W Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times [46] One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\" [43] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system [48] [49] Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company [50]\n\n\nTesla Electric Light and Manufacturing\nSoon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, [60] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison [46] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents [60] Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company [61] Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey [62] Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.\n\n\nAC and the induction motor\nIn late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck [65] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain [66] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, [67] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1⁄3 to Tesla, 1⁄3 to Peck and Brown, and 1⁄3 to fund development [66] They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.\n\n\nMarket turmoil\nTesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies [81] [82] The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston sometimes siding with Edison [83] [84] Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away [85]\n\n\nNew York laboratories\nThe money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests [95] In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895–1902) [96] [97] Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.\n\n\nTesla coil\nIn the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves [98] In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil To fix this problem Tesla came up with his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil [99] Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity [100] He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work [101] [102]\n\n\nCitizenship\nOn 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States [103] [104] In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil [105]\n\n\nWireless lighting\nAfter 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil [106] He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage [107] He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings [108]\n\n\nPolyphase system and the Columbian Exposition\nBy the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F Scott and then Benjamin G Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter [112] Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\" They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems [113]\n\n\nSteam-powered oscillating generator\nDuring his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current [123] Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity [124] [125]\n\n\nConsulting on Niagara\nIn 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system [126]\n\n\nThe Nikola Tesla Company\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F Coaney [127] It found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.\n\n\nLab fire\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition Tesla told The New York Times \"I am in too much grief to talk What can I say?\" [128]  After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\n\nX-ray experimentation\nStarting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments [129] (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-rays\") His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens [130]\n\n\nRadio remote control\nIn 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed \"telautomaton\"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden [137] Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest [138] Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs [139] Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was traveling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.\n\n\nWireless power\nFrom the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.\n\n\nColorado Springs\nTo further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899 [150] [151] [152] [153]  There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Electric Light Company to supply alternating current free of charge [153] To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,662,400 in today's dollars [77]) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments [154] Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris [155]\n\n\nWardenclyffe\nTesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria's Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico's [166] In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($5,493,600 in today's dollars [77]) from J P Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161 km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island [167]\n\n\nLater years\nAfter Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after \"the great man\" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925 After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop [171]\n\n\nBladeless turbine\nOn his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp [172] Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers [173] [174] He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device [175] [page needed] Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments [176]\n\n\nWireless lawsuits\nWhen World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement [177] Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917 [177] [178]\n\n\nNobel Prize rumors\nOn 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg \"for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays\" [184] [185] [186] There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize [184] The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous\"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner [184]\n\n\nOther awards, patents and ideas\nTesla won numerous medals and awards over this time They include:\n\n\nLiving circumstances\nTesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill [204] He moved to the St Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind [205] [206]\n\n\nBirthday press conferences\nIn 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday [216] Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, [217] and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine [218] The cover caption \"All the world's his power house\" noted his contribution to electrical power generation The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own creation He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims [219] [220]\n\n\nDeath\nIn the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was struck by a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered [232] [233]\n\n\nPersonal life and character\nTesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities [236] In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"Now the soft-voiced gentlewoman of my reverent worship has all but vanished In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions...\" [211] Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, [209] Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.\n\n\nViews and beliefs\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity [259] [260] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy [261]\n\n\nOn experimental and theoretical physics\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity [259] [260] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy [261]\n\n\nOn society\nWith significant post-war activity\n\n\nOn religion\nTesla was raised an Orthodox Christian Later in life he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense\", said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.\" [272] He also said \"To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise.\" [272]\n\n\nLiterary works\nTesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals [273] Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla (1993), compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nIn 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, influential Yugoslav politician Sava Kosanović  [sr], Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum [278]\n\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\n\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nFurther

the development of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity system. He is also credited with developing the Tesla coil, a type of resonant transformer that produces high-voltage, low-current electricity.\n\n## Early Years\n\nNikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, which was then part of the Austrian Empire. His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest, and his mother, Đuka Tesla, was a homemaker. Tesla was the fourth of five children, and his family was of Serbian descent.\n\n## Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange\n\nIn 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, he realized that the company was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.\n\n## Working at Edison\n\nIn 1882, Tesla got a job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company, where he began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. Tesla gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering and was soon noticed by management for his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics. They had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.\n\n## Moving to the United States\n\nIn 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States and began working at the Edison Machine Works in New York City. He worked on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times, and one of those times was noted in his autobiography where he stayed up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon.\n\n## Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing\n\nSoon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W Serrell to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company.\n\n## AC and the Induction Motor\n\nIn late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. They agreed to back Tesla financially and handle his patents. They formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887 and set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan. Tesla worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.\n\n## Market Turmoil\n\nTesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other.\n\n## New York Laboratories\n\nThe money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan.\n\n## Tesla Coil\n\nIn the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. Tesla repeated and expanded on these experiments, trying to power a Ruhmkorff coil with a high-speed alternator.\n\n## Citizenship\n\nOn July 30, 1891, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\n## Wireless Lighting\n\nTesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling.\n\n## Polyphase System and the Columbian Exposition\n\nBy the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F Scott and then Benjamin G Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems.\n\n## Steam-Powered Oscillating Generator\n\nTesla introduced his steam-powered reciprocating electricity generator at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall. The generator used a magnetic armature that vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field.\n\n## Consulting on Niagara\n\nIn 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls.

His work on the AC system revolutionized the way electricity is transmitted and used around the world. His vision for wireless power transmission and his experiments with radio communication were decades ahead of their time.\n\nIn 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, influential Yugoslav politician Sava Kosanović, Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade. In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade, where they are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nikola_Tesla\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nNikola Tesla was born into an ethnic Serb family in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present-day Croatia), on 10 July 1856 [9] [10] His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), [11] was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church [12] [13] [14] [15] His father's brother Josif was a lecturer at a military academy who wrote several textbooks on mathematics [11]\n\n\nWorking at Budapest Telephone Exchange\nTesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described [31] [better source needed]\n\n\nWorking at Edison\nIn 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company [41] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors [42] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.\n\n\nMoving to the United States\nIn 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well [44] In June 1884, Tesla emigrated [45] and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city [46] As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators [47] Historian W Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times [46] One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\" [43] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system [48] [49] Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company [50]\n\n\nTesla Electric Light and Manufacturing\nSoon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, [60] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison [46] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents [60] Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company [61] Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey [62] Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.\n\n\nAC and the induction motor\nIn late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck [65] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain [66] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, [67] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1⁄3 to Tesla, 1⁄3 to Peck and Brown, and 1⁄3 to fund development [66] They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.\n\n\nMarket turmoil\nTesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies [81] [82] The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston sometimes siding with Edison [83] [84] Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away [85]\n\n\nNew York laboratories\nThe money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests [95] In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895–1902) [96] [97] Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.\n\n\nTesla coil\nIn the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves [98] In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil To fix this problem Tesla came up with his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil [99] Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity [100] He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work [101] [102]\n\n\nCitizenship\nOn 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States [103] [104] In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil [105]\n\n\nWireless lighting\nAfter 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil [106] He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage [107] He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings [108]\n\n\nPolyphase system and the Columbian Exposition\nBy the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F Scott and then Benjamin G Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter [112] Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\" They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems [113]\n\n\nSteam-powered oscillating generator\nDuring his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current [123] Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity [124] [125]\n\n\nConsulting on Niagara\nIn 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do it Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system [126]\n\n\nThe Nikola Tesla Company\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F Coaney [127] It found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.\n\n\nLab fire\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition Tesla told The New York Times \"I am in too much grief to talk What can I say?\" [128]  After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\n\nX-ray experimentation\nStarting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments [129] (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-rays\") His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens [130]\n\n\nRadio remote control\nIn 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed \"telautomaton\"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden [137] Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest [138] Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs [139] Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was traveling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.\n\n\nWireless power\nFrom the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.\n\n\nColorado Springs\nTo further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899 [150] [151] [152] [153]  There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Electric Light Company to supply alternating current free of charge [153] To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,662,400 in today's dollars [77]) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments [154] Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris [155]\n\n\nWardenclyffe\nTesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria's Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico's [166] In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($5,493,600 in today's dollars [77]) from J P Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161 km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island [167]\n\n\nLater years\nAfter Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after \"the great man\" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925 After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop [171]\n\n\nBladeless turbine\nOn his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp [172] Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers [173] [174] He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device [175] [page needed] Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments [176]\n\n\nWireless lawsuits\nWhen World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement [177] Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917 [177] [178]\n\n\nNobel Prize rumors\nOn 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg \"for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays\" [184] [185] [186] There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize [184] The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous\"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner [184]\n\n\nOther awards, patents and ideas\nTesla won numerous medals and awards over this time They include:\n\n\nLiving circumstances\nTesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill [204] He moved to the St Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind [205] [206]\n\n\nBirthday press conferences\nIn 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday [216] Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, [217] and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine [218] The cover caption \"All the world's his power house\" noted his contribution to electrical power generation The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own creation He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims [219] [220]\n\n\nDeath\nIn the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was struck by a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered [232] [233]\n\n\nPersonal life and character\nTesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities [236] In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"Now the soft-voiced gentlewoman of my reverent worship has all but vanished In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions...\" [211] Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, [209] Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.\n\n\nViews and beliefs\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity [259] [260] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy [261]\n\n\nOn experimental and theoretical physics\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity [259] [260] Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy [261]\n\n\nOn society\nWith significant post-war activity\n\n\nOn religion\nTesla was raised an Orthodox Christian Later in life he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense\", said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.\" [272] He also said \"To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise.\" [272]\n\n\nLiterary works\nTesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals [273] Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla (1993), compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.\n\n\nLegacy and honors\nIn 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, influential Yugoslav politician Sava Kosanović  [sr], Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum [278]\n\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\n\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nBooks\n\n\nFurther reading\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni, Gene October, and Mark Stewart [9] Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with \"pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look\" [10]\n\n\nLydon joins\nDescribing the social context in which the band formed, John Lydon said that mid-seventies Britain was \"a very depressing place .. completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment, just about everybody was on strike .. if you came from the wrong side of the tracks .. then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all.\" [22]\n\n\nEarly following\nThe Saint Martins gig was followed by performances at colleges around London The band's core early followers—including Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and Billy Idol, Jordan, and Soo Catwoman—came to be known as the Bromley Contingent, after the suburban south-east London borough that several of them were from [45] [46] Their cutting-edge fashion, much of it supplied by Sex, ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted [47] McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle for more than just couture They were influenced by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris, particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists [48] [49] [50] These interests were shared with Jamie Reid, a friend of McLaren who took over the design of the band's visual imagery in the spring of 1976 [51] His cut-up lettering—based on notes left by kidnappers or terrorists—were used to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band, although they were actually introduced by McLaren's friend Helen Wellington-Lloyd [52] [53] [54] Reid has said that he used \"to talk to John  [Lydon] a lot about the Situationists .. the Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren't getting the message from left-wing politics\" [55] McLaren was also arranging for the band's first photo sessions [56] According to the writer Jon Savage, Lydon \"with his green hair, hunched stance and ragged looked .. looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell\" [24] [note 1]\n\n\nMainstream fame\nThe record label EMI signed the band on a two-year contract on 8 October 1976 [94] The Pistols were soon in a studio recording a full-dress session with Dave Goodman According to Matlock, \"The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance We were pressurized to make it faster and faster.\" [95] The results were rejected by the band Chris Thomas, who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, was brought in to produce [96] The band's first single, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", was released on 26 November 1976 [95] The musician and journalist John Robb later described the record's impact: \"From Steve Jones' opening .. descending chords, to Johnny Rotten's .. sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement .. a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics.\" [97] Colin Newman of the early post-punk band Wire, described it as \"the clarion call of a generation\" [98]\n\n\nSid Vicious replaces Matlock\nOn 28 February 1977 McLaren announced Matlock was leaving the band because Matlock \"went on too long about Paul McCartney.\" [119] Although Matlock says he left voluntarily, Jones claimed in a contemporary interview that he was sacked because he \"liked the Beatles\", [120] [119] [121] In 2005, Jones admitted that although Matlock was a good songwriter, he \"didn't look like a Sex Pistol\" [122] [note 4] In 1990, Matlock described the reason as his bitter relationship with Rotten, exacerbated—in Matlock's account—by Rotten's attitude \"once he'd had his name in the papers\" [123] Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren [124]\n\n\nA&M, Virgin, and Jubilee week\n\nThe Pistols signed to A&M Records at a March 1977 press ceremony held outside Buckingham Palace Afterwards, intoxicated, they went to the A&M offices where Vicious reportedly broke a toilet bowl and Rotten verbally abused members of the label's staff [137] [138] A couple of days later, the Pistols got into a fight with another band at a club; one of Rotten's friends threatened a friend of A&M's English director; A&M broke their contract with the Pistols on 16 March Although 25,000 copies of the \"God Save the Queen\" single had already been pressed, nearly all were destroyed [139] \n\nNever Mind the Bollocks\nBeginning in early 1977, Lydon, Jones and Cook began to record tracks for their debut album with producer Chris Thomas Initially titled God Save Sex Pistols, it became known during the summer as Never Mind the Bollocks [159] Vicious's lack of musical ability became apparent soon after he joined the sessions; according to Jones they \"tried as hard as possible not to let  [Vicious] anywhere near the studio\" [160] Although Matlock was asked to return as a session musician, Jones ultimately played most of the bass parts [161] Vicious's bass is reportedly present on \"Bodies\": According to Jones, \"we just let him do it When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low.\" [160] Jones says that Vicious showed up for the \"God Save the Queen\" session, while Lydon remembers him being there during the recording of an unused version of \"Submission\" [162] Two further singles were released from the Thomas sessions; \"Pretty Vacant\" on 1 July [163] [164] [165] and \"Holidays in the Sun\" on 14 October [166] Each was a top-ten hit [167]\n\n\nBreak-up\nThe Pistols January 1978 US tour was initially scheduled for nine dates, but due to Vicious's drug use and the breakdown in the relationship between Lydon and McLaren was cut short after seven shows [179] It was delayed due to American authorities' reluctance to issue a visa to Jones, given his criminal record, leading to the cancellation of several dates in the Northeast [168] [180] Although the tour had been highly anticipated in the US, it was plagued by in-fighting and poor planning, leading to frustrated and belligerent audiences [127] [181]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter leaving the Pistols, Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon and formed the influential post-punk band Public Image Ltd with former Clash member Keith Levene and school friend Jah Wobble [199] The band scored a UK top-ten hit with their debut single, 1978's \"Public Image\" The following year Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Pistols' management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title \"Johnny Rotten\", unfair contractual obligations [200] and damages for \"all the criminal activities that took place\" [201]\n\n\nPost-Lydon\nThe Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, a soundtrack album for the still-uncompleted film, was released by Virgin Records in February 1979 It consists mostly of cover songs and new tracks sung by Jones, Vicious, Cook, Biggs, McLaren and Edward Tudor-Pole Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded music by Jones and Cook There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco The album also contains  tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols songs [209] [210] [note 7] Four songs from Swindle became top ten singles, one more than from Never Mind the Bollocks The 1978 \"No One Is Innocent\"/\"My Way\" was followed in 1979 by Vicious's cover of Eddie Cochran's \"Something Else\" (number three, and the biggest-selling single under the Sex Pistols name); Jones singing an original, \"Silly Thing\" (number six); and Vicious's second Cochran cover, \"C'mon Everybody\" (number three) Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the Pistols brand—Tudor-Pole, among others, singing \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" and a Rotten vocal from 1976, \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\"; both fell just shy of the Top Twenty [211] [212]\n\n\nReunions\nThe original band members reunited in 1996 for the six-month Filthy Lucre tour, which included dates in Europe, North and South America, Australia and Japan [224] Their access to the archives associated with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle facilitated the production of the 2000 documentary The Filth and the Fury The film was also directed by Temple and formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to Swindle's focus on McLaren and the media [225] In 2002 the band reunited to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London They undertook a short tour of North America in 2003 [226]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Sex Pistols are widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in popular music history [240] [241] Their Trouser Press Record Guide entry claims that \"their importance—both to the direction of contemporary music and more generally to pop culture—can hardly be overstated\" [242] The music critic Dave Marsh called them \"unquestionably the most radical new rock band of the Seventies\" [243] Although not the first punk band, Never Mind the Bollocks is regularly cited as one of the all-time great albums: in 2006, it was voted No. 28 in Q magazine's \"100 Greatest Albums Ever\", [244] while Rolling Stone listed it at No. 2 in its 1987 \"Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years\" [245] It has come to be recognised as among the most influential records in rock history [230] [246] [247] [248] According to AllMusic, the album is \"one of the greatest, most inspiring rock records of all time\" [249]\n\n\nInfluence\nThe Sex Pistols are widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in popular music history

time\" [249]\n\n\nConceptual basis\nThe Sex Pistols were defined by ambitions that went beyond the musical—indeed, McLaren was at times openly contemptuous of the band's music and punk rock generally \"Christ, if people bought the records for the music, this thing would have died a death long ago\", he said in 1977 [40] He claimed that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: \"I decided to use people, just the way a sculptor uses clay.\" [40] According to McLaren, they were something with which \"to sell trousers\" [271] and a \"carefully planned exercise to embezzle as much money as possible out of the music industry\" Jon Savage characterises McLaren's core theme in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle [272] as an attempt to extract \"cash from chaos\" [note

According to Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments he had stolen. The band regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea, London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die. McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the '50s rocker look. The shop then became a focal point of the early London punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni, Gene October, and Mark Stewart.

According to Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments he had stolen. The band regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea, London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die.

Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with \"pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look.\"\n\n## Lydon Joins\n\nDescribing the social context in which the band formed, John Lydon said that mid-seventies Britain was \"a very depressing place ... completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment, just about everybody was on strike ... if you came from the wrong side of the tracks ... then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all.\"\n\n## Early Following\n\nThe Saint Martins gig was followed by performances at colleges around London. The band's core early followers—including Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and Billy Idol, Jordan, and Soo Catwoman—came to be known as the Bromley Contingent, after the suburban south-east London borough that several of them were from. Their cutting-edge fashion, much of it supplied by Sex, ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted. McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle for more than just couture. They were influenced by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris, particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists. These interests were shared with Jamie Reid, a friend of McLaren who took over the design of the band's visual imagery in the spring of 1976. His cut-up lettering—based on notes left by kidnappers or terrorists—were used to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band.\n\n## Mainstream Fame\n\nThe record label EMI signed the band on a two-year contract on 8 October 1976. The Pistols were soon in a studio recording a full-dress session with Dave Goodman. According to Matlock, \"The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance We were pressurized to make it faster and faster.\" The results were rejected by the band. Chris Thomas, who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, was brought in to produce. The band's first single, \"Anarchy in the U.K.,\" was released on 26 November 1976. The musician and journalist John Robb later described the record's impact: \"From Steve Jones' opening ... descending chords, to Johnny Rotten's ... sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement ... a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics.\" Colin Newman of the early post-punk band Wire, described it as \"the clarion call of a generation.\"\n\n## Sid Vicious Replaces Matlock\n\nOn 28 February 1977 McLaren announced Matlock was leaving the band because Matlock \"went on too long about Paul McCartney.\" Although Matlock says he left voluntarily, Jones claimed in a contemporary interview that he was sacked because he \"liked the Beatles,\" and in 2005, Jones admitted that although Matlock was a good songwriter, he \"didn't look like a Sex Pistol.\" In 1990, Matlock described the reason as his bitter relationship with Rotten, exacerbated—in Matlock's account—by Rotten's attitude \"once he'd had his name in the papers.\" Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren.\n\n## A&M, Virgin, and Jubilee Week\n\nThe Pistols signed to A&M Records at a March 1977 press ceremony held outside Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, intoxicated, they went to the A&M offices where Vicious reportedly broke a toilet bowl and Rotten verbally abused members of the label's staff. A couple of days later, the Pistols got into a fight with another band at a club; one of Rotten's friends threatened a friend of A&M's English director; A&M broke their contract with the Pistols on 16 March. Although 25,000 copies of the \"God Save the Queen\" single had already been pressed, nearly all were destroyed.\n\n## Never Mind the Bollocks\n\nBeginning in early 1977, Lydon, Jones and Cook began to record tracks for their debut album with producer Chris Thomas. Initially titled God Save Sex Pistols, it became known during the summer as Never Mind the Bollocks. Vicious's lack of musical ability became apparent soon after he joined the sessions. According to Jones they \"tried as hard as possible not to let [Vicious] anywhere near the studio.\" Although Matlock was asked to return as a session musician, Jones ultimately played most of the bass parts. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on \"Bodies\". According to Jones, \"we just let him do it When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low.\"\n\n## Break-up\n\nThe Pistols January 1978 US tour was initially scheduled for nine dates, but due to Vicious's drug use and the breakdown in the relationship between Lydon and McLaren was cut short after seven shows. It was delayed due to American authorities' reluctance to issue a visa to Jones, given his criminal record, leading to the cancellation of several dates in the Northeast. Although the tour had been highly anticipated in the US, it was plagued by in-fighting and poor planning, leading to frustrated and belligerent audiences.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nAfter leaving the Pistols, Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon and formed the influential post-punk band Public Image Ltd with former Clash member Keith Levene and school friend Jah Wobble. The band scored a UK top-ten hit with their debut single, 1978's \"Public Image.\" The following year Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Pistols' management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled. Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title \"Johnny Rotten,\" unfair contractual obligations, and damages for \"all the criminal activities that took place.\"\n\n## Post-Lydon\n\nThe Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, a soundtrack album for the still-uncompleted film, was released by Virgin Records in February 1979. It consists mostly of cover songs and new tracks sung by Jones, Vicious, Cook, Biggs, McLaren and Edward Tudor-Pole. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded music by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album also contains tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols songs.\n\n## Reunions\n\nThe original band members reunited in 1996 for the six-month Filthy Lucre tour, which included dates in Europe, North and South America, Australia and Japan. Their access to the archives associated with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle facilitated the production of the 2000 documentary The Filth and the Fury. The film was also directed by Temple and formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to Swindle's focus on McLaren and the media. In 2002 the band reunited to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. They undertook a short tour of North America in 2003.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Sex Pistols are widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in popular music history. Their Trouser Press Record Guide entry claims that \"their importance—both to the direction of contemporary music and more generally to pop culture—can hardly be overstated.\" The music critic Dave Marsh called them \"unquestionably the most radical new rock band of the Seventies.\" Although not the first punk band, Never Mind the Bollocks is regularly cited as one of the all-time great albums: in 2006, it was voted No. 28 in Q magazine's \"100 Greatest Albums Ever\", while Rolling Stone listed it at No. 2 in its 1987 \"Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years.\" It has come to be recognised as among the most influential records in rock history.

embezzle as much money as possible out of the music industry\" Jon Savage characterises McLaren's core theme in The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle [272] as an attempt to extract \"cash from chaos\" [note

This theory, which has never gained much traction outside Italy, was first proposed by Santi Paladino, a Sicilian journalist, in 1927.\n\n**Early History**\n\nThe idea of a Florio connection to Shakespeare's works dates back to 1925, when Paladino reportedly stumbled upon a book titled \"Second Fruits,\" which he claimed was published in 1549 by Michelagnolo Florio. According to Paladino, the words and phrases in this book were repeated verbatim in Shakespeare's works, despite the fact that Shakespeare had not yet begun to publish nearly a half-century later.\n\nPaladino's 1927 article had an immediate echo abroad when it was picked up by German writer Erik Reger, who identified the 'real' Shakespeare as Michelagnolo Florio. This early reaction to Paladino's theory sparked a wave of interest in the idea, with several writers and scholars exploring the possibility that Florio was the true author of Shakespeare's works.\n\n**Early Postwar Revival**\n\nErnesto Grillo, Stevenson Professor of Italian Language and Literature at Glasgow University, made passing reference to Paladino's idea in a posthumous and updated edition of his 1925 study of Shakespeare's relationship with Italy. A revival of the hypothesis began in Italy when Carlo Villa, a journalist, picked up the thread in 1951 with his book \"William Shakespeare & the Valtellina poet Michelagnolo Florio.\" Villa's work developed further in his book \"Fra Donne e Drammi\" a decade later.\n\nIn 1954, some marginal support for the Florio theory came from Germany when a writer, identified as Franz Saalbach, advocated a Florio theory in a self-published brochure. Saalbach claimed that a Florio wrote not only all of Shakespeare, but also several other notable works of English literature, including Christopher Marlowe's \"Dr Faustus,\" Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy,\" Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene,\" Philip Sidney's \"An Apology for Poetry,\" and John Lyly's \"Euphues.\"\n\n**Resuscitation in the 2000s**\n\nIn 2002, Martino Iuvara, a retired high school teacher resident in Ispica, put out a self-published booklet reaffirming the Crollalanza theory. Iuvara claimed that Michel Agnolo Florio, a younger relative of John Florio's father, was born in Messina to a doctor Giovanni Florio and his wife, a Sicilian noblewoman, Guglielma Crollolanza. According to Iuvara, Michelangelo Florio took refuge in England and settled with relatives of his wife, a Crollolanza family in Stratford-on-Avon, where he adopted their name by translating it into English as 'Shake-spear.'\n\nIuvara argued that Michelangelo Florio wrote a comedy in Sicilian dialect, \"Troppu trafficu pe' nnenti,\" which was later translated into English with the title \"Much Ado About Nothing.\" However, this theory has been widely dismissed by scholars, who point out that there is no archival evidence to support the existence of such a play.\n\n**French Reflections**\n\nIn 2014, French philosopher Marc Goldschmit published a study on marrano culture, which dealt with his hypothesis about the way converted Jews inflected the Christian sociopolitical cultures of Europe. Goldschmit argued that Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" reflects a thorough grasp of Jewish culture, and that the characters of Portia and Bassanio betray all of the lineaments of crypto-Jews.\n\n**Critical Reactions**\n\nWhen the French edition of Tassinari's book came out, Shakespeare scholar François Laroque commented that the book contains nothing new but was old hat, a 'game' going back to Delia Bacon. Laroque argued that pseudo-revelations of this sensationalist type aspire to stir up polemical reactions from practitioners of orthodox scholarship in order to secure their otherwise hackneyed ideas a certain visibility.\n\nLaroque also noted that the more informed academics defend Shakespeare, the greater the inadvertent impression is that the 'nasty' establishment of Shakespearean authorities is engaged in a conspiracy to muffle up what a self-styled iconoclastic smasher of their omertà claims he is exposing.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Florian theory of Shakespeare authorship has been a topic of debate and discussion among scholars and writers for many years. While it is a fascinating idea, it remains a minority view that has not been widely accepted by the academic community. The theory has been subject to various interpretations and criticisms, and its validity remains a matter of ongoing debate.\n\nDespite its limited acceptance, the Florian theory has contributed to a broader understanding of Shakespeare's works and their cultural context. It has also sparked important discussions about the nature of authorship, the role of cultural influences in shaping literary works, and the complexities of historical interpretation.\n\nUltimately, the Florian theory of Shakespeare authorship serves as a reminder of the ongoing importance of critical thinking, scholarly inquiry, and intellectual curiosity in our understanding of the past and its cultural legacies.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Florian_theory_of_Shakespeare_authorship\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly history\nAn early outline of this variant of the Shakespeare authorship question, which has never gained much traction outside Italy, [a] was first proposed by Santi Paladino, a Sicilian journalist [4] According to Shakespearean scholar Frank W Wadsworth, the idea came to Paladino in 1925 while he brooded over a fortune-teller's prediction that he was destined to startle the world with an \"important revelation\" [5] Paladino recalled later how one day in his father's library he stumbled across a copy of a book, Second Fruits, that he claimed had been published in 1549 by \"Michael Agnolo Florio\" [b] In it he found words and phrases that he thought were repeated verbatim in William Shakespeare's works, even though Shakespeare had only begun to publish nearly a half a century later [6]\n\n\nForeign reactions\nPaladino's 1927 article had an immediate echo abroad when it was picked up by German writer Erik Reger in a review, \"Der Italiener Shakespeare\" (The Italian Shakespeare), published in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung that same year [21] [22] [23] Reger identified the 'real' Shakespeare as Michelagnolo Florio [24]\n\n\nEarly postwar revival\nErnesto Grillo (1877–1946), Stevenson Professor of Italian Language and Literature at Glasgow University from 1925 to 1940, made passing reference to Paladino's idea in a posthumous and updated edition of his 1925 study of Shakespeare's relationship with Italy [30] [31] A revival of his hypothesis began in Italy when Carlo Villa, a journalist, picked up the thread in 1951 with his Paris is well worth a mass!

and successful revolutions and coups d'état in the two centuries since independence [3] [4] By 2024, Bolivia had not faced a coordinated military attempt to seize power in forty-odd years; [5] the last such venture occurred in 1984 but was unsuccessful [6]\n\n\nCoup attempt\nTwo days before the coup, on the night of 24 June, General Juan José Zúñiga, the commanding general of the Army, declared on the PAT network that if Morales attempted to run for president again, the Armed Forces would seek to arrest him \"That man cannot be president of this country again\", Zúñiga affirmed \"If the case warrants it, I think that yes  [we would arrest him]\" [13] The general's comments provoked a wave of criticism from supporters of Morales and the opposition, [14] and by the next day, sources

crisis when a group of military leaders, led by General Juan José Zúñiga, attempted to seize power in a coup d'état. The event marked a significant turning point in the country's history, as it threatened the stability of the democratic government and the rule of law. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the events leading up to the coup, the attempted takeover, and the subsequent aftermath.\n\n**Background**\n\nBolivia has a long history of political instability, with numerous coups and revolutions since its independence in 1825. However, the country marked a significant transition to democracy in 1982, when the Armed Forces ceded power to a civilian-led government elected two years prior. Despite continued economic turmoil and political instability, the return to civilian rule mostly closed the cycle of volatility that had plagued the country for centuries. By 2024, Bolivia had not faced a coordinated military attempt to seize power in over 40 years, with the last such venture occurring in 1984 but being unsuccessful.\n\n**Coup Attempt**\n\nOn the night of June 24, 2024, General Juan José Zúñiga, the commanding general of the Army, declared on the PAT network that if President Luis Arce attempted to run for president again, the Armed Forces would seek to arrest him. Zúñiga's comments provoked a wave of criticism from supporters of Morales and the opposition. The general's statement was seen as a veiled threat to the government, and it sparked widespread concern among politicians and citizens alike.\n\n**Prelude and Early Maneuvering**\n\nIn the days leading up to the coup attempt, there were rumors of a plot to overthrow the government. The Armed Forces had been increasingly critical of the Morales government, and there were concerns that they might attempt to stage a coup. However, the government took steps to prevent such an eventuality, including deploying troops to key locations and increasing security measures.\n\n**Capture of the Plaza Murillo**\n\nOn the afternoon of June 25, 2024, armed troops began seizing control of Plaza Murillo, the political center of Bolivia, where both the executive and legislative branches are headquartered. The troops were followed by a contingent of military vehicles, and they quickly took control of the square. María Nela Prada, minister of the presidency, recalled that Arce learned of the uprising when he inquired about sirens outside. \"I go to the window and see military tanks taking over the plaza,\" she said.\n\n**Resolution and Military Withdrawal**\n\nBack inside the palace, the only commander yet remaining was General Wilfredo Zegarra, who either faltered at the last minute or was unaware of the military's ultimate objective from the start. Zegarra accompanied Arce back to the Casa Grande, where they held a short meeting. \"I insisted that he reflect on the consequences that could come,\" the president recounted. Minutes later, Arce released a short video from his office, where he urged the populace to \"mobilize against the coup d'état.\" By that point, the Bolivian Workers' Center – the largest trade union in the country – had declared an indefinite nationwide general strike and called on labor groups to march on La Paz in defense of the government.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe coup attempt was met with swift international condemnation, with heads of state of several neighboring Latin American states expressing support for and solidarity with the incumbent democratic government. The government of Russia and the Prime Minister of Spain also condemned the coup. The European Union, as well as other international organizations, such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of American States (OAS), expressed concern over the ongoing state of affairs. In contrast, the government of Javier Milei in Argentina denied the coup's authenticity and endorsed the narrative of a \"fraudulent\" self-coup.\n\n**Domestic**\n\nThe Bolivian government responded to the coup attempt by deploying troops to key locations and increasing security measures. The president also called on the populace to \"mobilize against the coup d'état.\" The opposition parties, including the Movement for Socialism (MAS) and the Civic Committee for Bolivia, condemned the coup attempt and called for the government to take all necessary measures to prevent it.\n\n**International**\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the coup attempt, with many countries expressing support for the incumbent democratic government. The United States stated that it was \"closely monitoring the situation.\" The OAS met for its annual General Assembly the day after the coup, where it issued a unanimous resolution expressing \"serious concern\" over the previous day's events. The document denounced the coup plotters for their \"flagrant insubordination,\" stating that the military uprising \"constitute[d] a threat to the constitutional regime of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.\"\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn the evening of June 26, 2024, Bolivian police arrested General Juan José Zúñiga. The public prosecutor's office announced it would criminally investigate the coup plotters. The government also took steps to prevent future coup attempts, including deploying troops to key locations and increasing security measures. The international community continued to express support for the incumbent democratic government, with many countries calling for the perpetrators of the coup attempt to be brought to justice.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* 2019 Bolivian political crisis\n* 2020 Bolivian general election\n* Military coups in Bolivia\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete

{"title": "Betty_Ford", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nFord was born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, the third child and only daughter of Hortense (née Neahr; 1884 – 1948) and William Stephenson Bloomer Sr (1874–1934), who was a travelling salesman for Royal Rubber Co [3] She was called Betty as a child.\n\n\nMarriage to William G. Warren\nIn 1942, Elizabeth Bloomer married William G Warren, [5] [4] whom she had known since she was 12 [5] At the time they married, Warren worked for his own father in insurance sales Shortly after they married, he began to sell insurance for another company He later worked for the Continental Can Company, and after that for the Widdicomb Furniture Company The couple moved frequently because of his work At one point, they lived in Toledo, Ohio, where Elizabeth was employed at the department store Lasalle & Koch as a demonstrator, a job that entailed being a model and saleswoman She worked a production line for a frozen food company in Fulton, New York When they returned to Grand Rapids, she worked again at Herpolsheimer's, this time as the fashion coordinator [11] She had, three years into the marriage, concluded that their relationship was a failure She desired to have a family with children and was unhappy with the frequent moves between cities she had experienced in her marriage [5] Warren was an alcoholic and diabetic, and was in poor health Shortly after she decided to file for divorce, Warren fell into a coma She paused her divorce, and supported him, living at Warren's family's home for the next two years as his health recovered During these two years, she lived upstairs while he was nursed downstairs [3] She worked jobs in order to support both herself and Warren This experience has been credited with further cementing Ford's understanding of gender-based income inequalities between individuals doing the same work [5] After he recovered, they were divorced on September 22, 1947 [3] [5]\n\n\nMarriage to Gerald Ford and motherhood\nIn August 1947, she was introduced by mutual friends to Gerald Ford, a lawyer and World War II veteran who had just resumed his legal practice after returning from Navy service, and was planning to run for the United States House of Representatives [3] [5] [12] They married on October 15, 1948, at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids Gerald Ford was in the middle of his campaign for the U.S House of Representatives In the first of adjustments for politics, he had asked her to delay the wedding until shortly before the primary election because, as The New York Times reported, \"Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer.\" [3] [13] For their honeymoon, the two briefly traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they attended a college football game between the Michigan Wolverines and the Northwestern Wildcats, before driving to Owosso, Michigan, to attend a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee Thomas Dewey [14] The Fords would ultimately be married for the next 58 years, until Gerald Ford's death [15] An anecdote that was later reported was that, when Gerald Ford left Grand Rapids for Washington, D.C., Betty Ford's new sister-in-law Janet Ford remarked to her, \"with Jerry, you'll never have to worry about other women Your cross will be his work.\" [7]\n\n\nSecond Lady of the United States (1973–1974)\nSpiro Agnew resigned as vice president on October 10, 1973 [22] Two days later, on October 12, 1973, President Richard Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to serve as vice president [12] Ford felt an obligation to attend her husband's testimony at his confirmation hearings During his testimony, Gerald Ford was questioned about attending psychiatric care After this, Betty Ford was transparent with the news media that she had received psychiatric care She explained that, while her husband had attended two sessions with a psychiatric doctor, those sessions were for her care, and not care of his own [3] Gerald Ford was confirmed as vice president by the United States Congress on December 6, 1973, and he took the oath of office before a joint session of the United States Congress while placing his hand upon a bible that Betty Ford held [3] [12] With her husband assuming the office of vice president, Ford became the second lady of the United States [3]\n\n\nFirst Lady of the United States (1974–1977)\nOn August 9, 1974, after the resignation of Richard Nixon (who was facing the prospect of likely impeachment and removal from office), Gerald Ford ascended to the position of president of the United States [12] and Betty Ford became the first lady of the United States As was the case during Gerald Ford's vice presidential swearing-in, Betty Ford held the Bible upon which he placed his hand while taking his oath of office In his remarks at his inauguration, Gerald Ford remarked, \"I am indebted to no man and only one woman, my dear wife, Betty, as I begin this very difficult job.\" [3]\n\n\nPublic image, influence, and candor\nAt the time her husband assumed the presidency, reporters speculated on what kind of first lady Ford would be, as they thought her predecessor, Pat Nixon, as noted by one reporter, to be the \"most disciplined, composed first lady in history.\" [28] Ford ultimately became a popular and influential first lady In the opinion of The New York Times and several presidential historians, \"Mrs Ford's impact on American culture may be far wider and more lasting than that of her husband, who served a mere 896 days, much of it spent trying to restore the dignity of the office of the president.\" [29] She was regarded to be the most politically outspoken first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, [7] [30] whom she regarded as a role model [31] Active in social policy, Ford broke new ground as a politically active presidential spouse [32]\n\n\nPopularity\nFord was popular with the American public Her overall approval rating was, at times, as high as 75% [34] Ford's popularity often was higher than her husband's [19] Ford said, during her husband's failed 1976 presidential campaign, \"I would give my life to have Jerry have my poll numbers.\" [34] This reflects a common trend of American first ladies often being more popular than the presidents to whom they are married [43]\n\n\nRanking in Gallup's annual poll of \"Most Admired Women\"\nDuring her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women's rights and was a prominent force in the Women's Movement of the 1970s [55] Her active political role prompted Time to call her the country's \"Fighting First Lady\" and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the \"American Women\" as the magazine's 1975 Person of the Year [32] On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, \"would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.\" [19]\n\n\nApproval polling\nDuring her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women's rights and was a prominent force in the Women's Movement of the 1970s [55] Her active political role prompted Time to call her the country's \"Fighting First Lady\" and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the \"American Women\" as the magazine's 1975 Person of the Year [32] On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, \"would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.\" [19]\n\n\nSocial policy and political activism\nDuring her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women's rights and was a prominent force in the Women's Movement of the 1970s [55] Her active political role prompted Time to call her the country's \"Fighting First Lady\" and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the \"American Women\" as the magazine's 1975 Person of the Year [32] On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, \"would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.\" [19]\n\n\nHealth and breast cancer awareness\nWeeks after Ford became first lady, she underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer on September 28, 1974, after having been diagnosed with the disease [59] Ford decided to be open about her illness because \"There had been so much cover-up during Watergate that we wanted to be sure there would be no cover-up in the Ford administration.\" [60] Her openness about her cancer and treatment raised the visibility of a disease that Americans had previously been reluctant to talk about.\n\n\nThe arts\nAs First Lady, Ford was an advocate of the arts She successfully lobbied her husband to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to choreographer and dancer Martha Graham in 1976 She received an award from Parsons The New School for Design in recognition of her style [3]\n\n\nState dinners\nDespite the brevity of her husband's presidency (roughly two and a half years), he hosted 33 state dinners, the fifth most state dinners of any United States president [25] The first of these came only a week into Ford's presidency, hosting King Hussein of Jordan on August 16, 1974 [25] [64] Once she became first lady, it fell to Ford to arrange this already-scheduled dinner [8] [65] She found out of this upcoming dinner and her responsibility for planning it through a phone call she received within 24-hours after her husband's swearing-in as president [66] As previously mentioned, the Fords had hosted a state dinner for King Hussein months earlier, during Gerald Ford's vice presidency, on March 12, 1974, after president Nixon asked then-Vice President Ford to take over for him in hosting a planned dinner for the King [25] [26] At the first state dinner that she arranged as first lady, Ford revived dancing as an activity of White House state dinners The Nixons had previously removed dancing from the state dinners during Nixon's presidency [64] At the state dinners of the Ford presidency, the president and first lady always led off the dancing, and dancing often lasted beyond midnight [64]\n\n\nDiplomatic trips\nFord accompanied her husband abroad on several diplomatic trips Among the nations that Ford accompanied her husband to were China, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia [3]\n\n\nPhilanthropic causes\nFord supported numerous charities as first lady Ford assisted in fundraising for the little-known Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, D.C., whose patients were predominantly African American She also fundraised for No Greater Love, in appreciation of its work benefiting Children of Vietnam War MIA and POWs She served as the honorary president of the National Lupus Foundation, regarding lupus as a disease which impacted women, yet received minimal public attention Her philanthropic support additionally placed a specific focus on charities serving children with special needs [3]\n\n\nRole in the 1976 presidential campaign\nIn November 1975, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ford's husband's advisors, who had previously worried her outspoken comments would hurt him in the 1976 presidential election, were now recognizing her popularity and desiring for her to have a greater role in the campaign [38] Ford ultimately played an important role in the 1976 election campaign Ford made campaign appearances and delivered speeches across the United States [3]\n\n\nDeparture from the White House\nDuring the period after the election, Ford postponed scheduled plans to give her slated successor, Rosalynn Carter, a tour of the White House Unknown to Carter at the time, this was likely due to Ford's fragility caused by her prescription drug abuse When Ford attempted to postpone the plans a second time, President-elect Carter called the White House and threatened to make a fuss in the news if the tour was not held as planned Ford capitulated and gave a brief, but cordial, tour of the White House to Rosalynn Carter on November 22, 1976, coinciding with President-elect Carter's White House meeting with President Ford [71] [72]\n\n\nPost–White House life and career\nAfter leaving the White House in 1977, Ford continued to lead an active public life In addition to founding the Betty Ford Center, she remained active in women's issues, taking on numerous speaking engagements and lending her name to charities for fundraising [80] Many of Ford's most significant contributions as an activist came following the Fords' departure from the White House [19]\n\n\nRecovery from alcoholism and prescription drug addiction\nFord had suffered from a dependency on prescription medication and from alcoholism prior even to her husband's presidency [19] Ford had, particularly, become addicted to prescription medication (opioid analgesics) that she had been originally prescribed in the early 1960s to treat a pinched nerve [3] [19] Ford took doses of this medication in excess of her prescription [19] In her 1987 memoir she reflected on these addictions, writing, \"I liked alcohol, it made me feel warm And I loved pills They took away my tension and my pain\" [87] The fact that Ford had, for years, been given tranquilizers to treat a pinched nerve in her neck was public knowledge as far back as her time as second lady [21] During her time as first lady, there had even been some private speculation that Ford might have been suffering from substance abuse, as her friends and members of the press had observed occasional slurred speech from Ford [88]\n\n\nThe Betty Ford Center\nIn 1982, after recovering from her own addictions, Ford established the Betty Ford Center (initially called the Betty Ford Clinic) in Rancho Mirage, California Its mission specializes in the treatment of chemical dependency, [91] including treating the children of alcoholics [92] She partnered with her friend Ambassador Leonard Firestone to found it [93] She served as chair of the board of directors She also co-authored with Chris Chase a book about her treatment, Betty: A Glad Awakening (1987) In 2003, Ford produced another book, Healing and Hope: Six Women from the Betty Ford Center Share Their Powerful Journeys of Addiction and Recovery In 2005, Ford relinquished her chair of the center's board of directors to her daughter Susan She had held the top post at the center since its founding [15] [93]\n\n\nWomen's movement\nFord continued to be an active leader and activist of the feminist movement after the Ford administration She continued to strongly advocate and lobby politicians and state legislatures for passage of the ERA In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Ford to the second National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year (the first had been appointed by President Ford) That same year, she joined First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson and Rosalynn Carter to open and participate in the National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas, where she endorsed measures in the convention's National Plan of Action, a report sent to the state legislatures, the U.S Congress, and the President on how to improve the status of American women [95] Ford continued to be an outspoken supporter of equal pay for women, breast cancer awareness, and the ERA throughout her life [96] She was an active member of the Junior League [97]\n\n\nOther matters\nFord involved herself with the American Cancer Society and the Arthritis Foundation [103]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nBetty Ford died of natural causes on July 8, 2011, three months after her 93rd birthday, at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage [16] [114] Ford left $500,000 to the Betty Ford Center [88]\n\n\nHistorical assessments\nAccording to John Robert Greene:\n\n\nCultural depictions\nFord's life is the focus of the 1987 ABC biographical television film The Betty Ford Story, which has a story adapted from her memoir The Times of My Life Gena Rowlands won both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Ford [126] [127] [128] Ford is 1 of 3 former first ladies whose lives are the focus of

Warren\nIn 1942, Elizabeth Bloomer married William G Warren, [5] [4] whom she had known since she was 12 [5] At the time they married, Warren worked for his own father in insurance sales Shortly after they married, he began to sell insurance for another company He later worked for the Continental Can Company, and after that for the Widdicomb Furniture Company The couple moved frequently because of his work At one point, they lived in Toledo, Ohio, where Elizabeth was employed at the department store Lasalle & Koch as a demonstrator, a job that entailed being a model and saleswoman She worked a production line for a frozen food company in Fulton, New York When they returned to Grand Rapids, she worked again at Herpolsheimer's, this time as the fashion coordinator [11] She had, three years into the marriage, concluded that their relationship was a failure She desired to have a family with children and was unhappy with the frequent moves between cities she had experienced in her marriage [5] Warren was an alcoholic and diabetic, and was in poor health Shortly after she decided to file for divorce, Warren fell into a coma She paused her divorce, and supported him, living at Warren's family's home for the next two years as his health recovered During these two years, she lived upstairs while he was nursed downstairs [3] She worked jobs in order to support both herself and Warren This experience has been credited with further cementing Ford's understanding of gender-based income inequalities between individuals doing the same work [5] After he recovered, they were divorced on September 22, 1947 [3] [5]\n\n\nMarriage to Gerald Ford and motherhood\nIn August 1947, she was introduced by mutual friends to Gerald Ford, a lawyer and World War II veteran who had just resumed his legal practice after returning from Navy service, and was planning to run for the United States House of Representatives [3] [5] [12] They married on October 15, 1948, at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids Gerald Ford was in the middle of his campaign for the U.S House of Representatives In the first of adjustments for politics, he had asked her to delay the wedding until shortly before the primary election because, as The New York Times reported, \"Jerry was running for Congress and wasn't sure how voters might feel about his marrying a divorced ex-dancer.\" [3] [13] For their honeymoon, the two briefly traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they attended a college football game between the Michigan Wolverines and the Northwestern Wildcats, before driving to Owosso, Michigan, to attend a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee Thomas Dewey [14] The Fords would ultimately be married for the next 58 years, until Gerald Ford's death [15] An anecdote that was later reported was that, when Gerald Ford left Grand Rapids for Washington, D.C., Betty Ford's new sister-in-law Janet Ford remarked to her, \"with Jerry, you'll never have to worry about other women Your cross will be his work.\" [7]\n\n\nSecond Lady of the United States (1973–1974)\nSpiro Agnew resigned as vice president on October 10, 1973 [22] Two days later, on October 12, 1973, President Richard Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to serve as vice president [12] Ford felt an obligation to attend her husband's testimony at his confirmation hearings During his testimony, Gerald Ford was questioned about attending psychiatric care After this, Betty Ford was transparent with the news media that she had received psychiatric care She explained that, while her husband had attended two sessions with a psychiatric doctor, those sessions were for her care, and not care of his own [3] Gerald Ford was confirmed as vice president by the United States Congress on December 6, 1973, and he took the oath of office before a joint session of the United States Congress while placing his hand upon a bible that Betty Ford held [3] [12] With her husband assuming the office of vice president, Ford became the second lady of the United States [3]\n\n\nFirst Lady of the United States (1974–1977)\nOn August 9, 1974, after the resignation of Richard Nixon (who was facing the prospect of likely impeachment and removal from office), Gerald Ford ascended to the position of president of the United States [12] and Betty Ford became the first lady of the United States As was the case during Gerald Ford's vice presidential swearing-in, Betty Ford held the Bible upon which he placed his hand while taking his oath of office In his remarks at his inauguration, Gerald Ford remarked, \"I am indebted to no man and only one woman, my dear wife, Betty, as I begin this very difficult job.\" [3]\n\n\nPublic image, influence, and candor\nAt the time her husband assumed the presidency, reporters speculated on what kind of first lady Ford would be, as they thought her predecessor, Pat Nixon, as noted by one reporter, to be the \"most disciplined, composed first lady in history.\" [28] Ford ultimately became a popular and influential first lady In the opinion of The New York Times and several presidential historians, \"Mrs Ford's impact on American culture may be far wider and more lasting than that of her husband, who served a mere 896 days, much of it spent trying to restore the dignity of the office of the president.\" [29] She was regarded to be the most politically outspoken first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, [7] [30] whom she regarded as a role model [31] Active in social policy, Ford broke new ground as a politically active presidential spouse [32]\n\n\nPopularity\nFord was popular with the American public Her overall approval rating was, at times, as high as 75% [34] Ford's popularity often was higher than her husband's [19] Ford said, during her husband's failed 1976 presidential campaign, \"I would give my life to have Jerry have my poll numbers.\" [34] This reflects a common trend of American first ladies often being more popular than the presidents to whom they are married [43]\n\n\nRanking in Gallup's annual poll of \"Most Admired Women\"\nDuring her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women's rights and was a prominent force in the Women's Movement of the 1970s [55] Her active political role prompted Time to call her the country's \"Fighting First Lady\" and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the \"American Women\" as the magazine's 1975 Person of the Year [32] On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, \"would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.\" [19]\n\n\nApproval polling\nDuring her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women's rights and was a prominent force in the Women's Movement of the 1970s [55] Her active political role prompted Time to call her the country's \"Fighting First Lady\" and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the \"American Women\" as the magazine's 1975 Person of the Year [32] On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, \"would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.\" [19]\n\n\nSocial policy and political activism\nDuring her time as first lady, Ford was an outspoken advocate of women's rights and was a prominent force in the Women's Movement of the 1970s [55] Her active political role prompted Time to call her the country's \"Fighting First Lady\" and was the reason they profiled her, among several others, to represent the \"American Women\" as the magazine's 1975 Person of the Year [32] On September 4, 1974, weeks after becoming first lady, Ford conducted a press conference in the State Dining Room of the White House in which she remarked that she, \"would like to be remembered in a very kind way; also as a constructive wife of a president.\" [19]\n\n\nHealth and breast cancer awareness\nWeeks after Ford became first lady, she underwent a mastectomy for breast cancer on September 28, 1974, after having been diagnosed with the disease [59] Ford decided to be open about her illness because \"There had been so much cover-up during Watergate that we wanted to be sure there would be no cover-up in the Ford administration.\" [60] Her openness about her cancer and treatment raised the visibility of a disease that Americans had previously been reluctant to talk about.\n\n\nThe arts\nAs First Lady, Ford was an advocate of the arts She successfully lobbied her husband to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to choreographer and dancer Martha Graham in 1976 She received an award from Parsons The New School for Design in recognition of her style [3]\n\n\nState dinners\nDespite the brevity of her husband's presidency (roughly two and a half years), he hosted 33 state dinners, the fifth most state dinners of any United States president [25] The first of these came only a week into Ford's presidency, hosting King Hussein of Jordan on August 16, 1974 [25] [64] Once she became first lady, it fell to Ford to arrange this already-scheduled dinner [8] [65] She found out of this upcoming dinner and her responsibility for planning it through a phone call she received within 24-hours after her husband's swearing-in as president [66] As previously mentioned, the Fords had hosted a state dinner for King Hussein months earlier, during Gerald Ford's vice presidency, on March 12, 1974, after president Nixon asked then-Vice President Ford to take over for him in hosting a planned dinner for the King [25] [26] At the first state dinner that she arranged as first lady, Ford revived dancing as an activity of White House state dinners The Nixons had previously removed dancing from the state dinners during Nixon's presidency [64] At the state dinners of the Ford presidency, the president and first lady always led off the dancing, and dancing often lasted beyond midnight [64]\n\n\nDiplomatic trips\nFord accompanied her husband abroad on several diplomatic trips Among the nations that Ford accompanied her husband to were China, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia [3]\n\n\nPhilanthropic causes\nFord supported numerous charities as first lady Ford assisted in fundraising for the little-known Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, D.C., whose patients were predominantly African American She also fundraised for No Greater Love, in appreciation of its work benefiting Children of Vietnam War MIA and POWs She served as the honorary president of the National Lupus Foundation, regarding lupus as a disease which impacted women, yet received minimal public attention Her philanthropic support additionally placed a specific focus on charities serving children with special needs [3]\n\n\nRole in the 1976 presidential campaign\nIn November 1975, it was reported by the Associated Press that Ford's husband's advisors, who had previously worried her outspoken comments would hurt him in the 1976 presidential election, were now recognizing her popularity and desiring for her to have a greater role in the campaign [38] Ford ultimately played an important role in the 1976 election campaign Ford made campaign appearances and delivered speeches across the United States [3]\n\n\nDeparture from the White House\nDuring the period after the election, Ford postponed scheduled plans to give her slated successor, Rosalynn Carter, a tour of the White House Unknown to Carter at the time, this was likely due to Ford's fragility caused by her prescription drug abuse When Ford attempted to postpone the plans a second time, President-elect Carter called the White House and threatened to make a fuss in the news if the tour was not held as planned Ford capitulated and gave a brief, but cordial, tour of the White House to Rosalynn Carter on November 22, 1976, coinciding with President-elect Carter's White House meeting with President Ford [71] [72]\n\n\nPost–White House life and career\nAfter leaving the White House in 1977, Ford continued to lead an active public life In addition to founding the Betty Ford Center, she remained active in women's issues, taking on numerous speaking engagements and lending her name to charities for fundraising [80] Many of Ford's most significant contributions as an activist came following the Fords' departure from the White House [19]\n\n\nRecovery from alcoholism and prescription drug addiction\nFord had suffered from a dependency on prescription medication and from alcoholism prior even to her husband's presidency [19] Ford had, particularly, become addicted to prescription medication (opioid analgesics) that she had been originally prescribed in the early 1960s to treat a pinched nerve [3] [19] Ford took doses of this medication in excess of her prescription [19] In her 1987 memoir she reflected on these addictions, writing, \"I liked alcohol, it made me feel warm And I loved pills They took away my tension and my pain\" [87] The fact that Ford had, for years, been given tranquilizers to treat a pinched nerve in her neck was public knowledge as far back as her time as second lady [21] During her time as first lady, there had even been some private speculation that Ford might have been suffering from substance abuse, as her friends and members of the press had observed occasional slurred speech from Ford [88]\n\n\nThe Betty Ford Center\nIn 1982, after recovering from her own addictions, Ford established the Betty Ford Center (initially called the Betty Ford Clinic) in Rancho Mirage, California Its mission specializes in the treatment of chemical dependency, [91] including treating the children of alcoholics [92] She partnered with her friend Ambassador Leonard Firestone to found it [93] She served as chair of the board of directors She also co-authored with Chris Chase a book about her treatment, Betty: A Glad Awakening (1987) In 2003, Ford produced another book, Healing and Hope: Six Women from the Betty Ford Center Share Their Powerful Journeys of Addiction and Recovery In 2005, Ford relinquished her chair of the center's board of directors to her daughter Susan She had held the top post at the center since its founding [15] [93]\n\n\nWomen's movement\nFord continued to be an active leader and activist of the feminist movement after the Ford administration She continued to strongly advocate and lobby politicians and state legislatures for passage of the ERA In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Ford to the second National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year (the first had been appointed by President Ford) That same year, she joined First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson and Rosalynn Carter to open and participate in the National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas, where she endorsed measures in the convention's National Plan of Action, a report sent to the state legislatures, the U.S Congress, and the President on how to improve the status of American women [95] Ford continued to be an outspoken supporter of equal pay for women, breast cancer awareness, and the ERA throughout her life [96] She was an active member of the Junior League [97]\n\n\nOther matters\nFord involved herself with the American Cancer Society and the Arthritis Foundation [103]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nBetty Ford died of natural causes on July 8, 2011, three months after her 93rd birthday, at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage [16] [114] Ford left $500,000 to the Betty Ford Center [88]\n\n\nHistorical assessments\nAccording to John Robert Greene:\n\n\nCultural depictions\nFord's life is the focus of the 1987 ABC biographical television film The Betty Ford Story, which has a story adapted from her memoir The Times of My Life Gena Rowlands won both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Ford [126] [127] [128] Ford is 1 of 3 former first ladies whose lives are the focus of

In general, copyright law grants creators of original works the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their works, as well as to create derivative works. This means that downloading a copyrighted work without permission from the copyright holder can be considered copyright infringement.\n\nHowever, there are also exceptions and limitations to copyright law that can apply to downloading. For example, fair use provisions in copyright law allow for the use of copyrighted materials for certain purposes, such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Additionally, copyright law also recognizes the concept of \"fair use\" for non-commercial purposes, which can include downloading and sharing copyrighted materials for personal use.\n\n**Litigations in European Union**\n---------------------------------\n\nIn Europe, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has ruled that it is legal to create temporary or cached copies of works (copyrighted or otherwise) online. This ruling relates to the British Meltwater case, which was settled on June 5, 2014.\n\nThe Meltwater case involved a British company that provided a service to monitor and analyze news articles and other online content. The company claimed that it was entitled to create temporary copies of copyrighted works in order to provide its service, and that this was permitted under EU law.\n\nThe CJEU ultimately ruled in favor of Meltwater, holding that the creation of temporary copies of copyrighted works was permissible under EU law. This ruling has significant implications for the way in which online content is shared and used in the EU, and it highlights the complex and nuanced nature of copyright law in the digital age.\n\n**See also**\n------------\n\n* Streaming\n* Copyright law\n* Digital rights management\n* Online piracy\n\n**References**\n---------------\n\n* European Union Court of Justice.

on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market He also served as the field training officer for one of the other officers involved [4] While Floyd was handcuffed and lying facedown on the street, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds [5] For part of the time, two other officers knelt on Floyd's back [6] During the final two [7] minutes, Floyd was motionless and had no pulse [8]\n\n\nMurder of George Floyd\nDerek Chauvin was one of four officers of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) involved in the arrest of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market He also served as the field training officer for one of the other officers involved [4] While Floyd was handcuffed and lying facedown on the street, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds [5] For part of the time, two other officers knelt on Floyd's back [6] During the final two [7] minutes, Floyd was motionless and had no pulse [8]\n\n\nArrest, charges, and bail\nChauvin was arrested on May 29, 2020, [14] and initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, [15] [16] making him the first white police officer in Minnesota to be charged with murdering a black civilian [17] [18] On June 3, charges were amended to include second-degree murder, specifically unintentional second-degree murder while attempting to commit felony assault [19] [20] [21] Chauvin was released on conditional bail on October 7, 2020 after posting a bond of $1 million [22] [23] Court documentation provided that his release was supervised and would be forfeited if he declined to appear before a magistrate, refused to appear in court on scheduled dates, left the state of Minnesota without court approval, or had contact with Floyd's family [24]\n\n\nPre-trial proceedings\nOn August 29, 2020, Chauvin's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case, claiming that Floyd most likely died as a result of drug use and preexisting medical conditions On the same day, prosecutors moved to increase potential sentences for the four officers beyond the guidelines for all four accused, arguing that Floyd was vulnerable while being held down on the ground in handcuffs and was treated cruelly [25] [26] [27]\n\n\nTrial\nHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presided over the case [3] Cahill has been a judge since 2007 and previously worked as both a public defender and prosecutor [3]\n\n\nJudge and attorneys\nHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presided over the case [3] Cahill has been a judge since 2007 and previously worked as both a public defender and prosecutor [3]\n\n\nJury\nOn December 22, 2020, prospective jurors in Hennepin County were mailed a questionnaire asking about their views on the criminal justice system, the police, and social movements [43] [44] The questionnaire also asked prospective jurors to disclose how many times they viewed videos of Floyd's murder and whether they participated in the George Floyd protests [43] [44]\n\n\nOpening statements\nOpening statements from the prosecution and the defense were heard on March 29, 2021 [45] Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell started opening statements saying that \"Mr Chauvin betrayed his badge\" while defense attorney Eric Nelson said that \"Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do\" [52] Nelson's opening statement drew attention to the eyewitnesses who watched Floyd's death, who he characterized as an unruly and threatening crowd [53]\n\n\nProsecution case\nThe prosecution began its case on March 29, 2021, [52] and rested on April 13 after 11 days of testimony from 38 witnesses [54]\n\n\nProsecution witnesses\nAbout 400 people were included on a list of prospective trial witnesses, [55] but only 38 were called on to testify [56] The prosecution's witnesses were:\n\n\nBody camera and surveillance footage\nBody camera footage from the four officers involved was entered into evidence and shown at trial [98] Shortly after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance Chauvin's body camera shows him responding to a bystander who took issue with his kneeling on Floyd's neck Chauvin responded to the bystander saying, \"That's one person's opinion, we had to control this guy because he's a sizable guy It looks like he's probably on something.\" [99] Prosecutors also showed surveillance footage of Floyd at Cup Foods shortly before his murder [98]\n\n\nRebuttal witness\nIn a rebuttal to the defense's case on April 15, the prosecution called on Martin Tobin to testify again [100] Tobin, an expert in respiratory failure, disagreed with defense witness Fowler's contention that carbon monoxide from the squad car may have played a role in Floyd's death [100] Tobin testified that autopsy results showed Floyd's blood had an oxygen saturation level of 98%, meaning \"all there was for anything else was 2%\" and humans normally have a blood level of 0 to 3% carbon monoxide at any given time [100]\n\n\nDefense case\nThe defense began its case on April 13, 2021, [54] and rested on April 15 after two days of testimony from seven witnesses [101]\n\n\nDefense witnesses\nChauvin decided not to testify in his own defense, exercising his Fifth Amendment right [101] [102] The defense's witnesses were:\n\n\nFootage of Floyd's previous arrest\nThe New York Times reported that while trial judge Cahill tried to strictly limit Floyd's past acts and state of mind saying they were not relevant to the case, defense attorney Nelson was allowed to open Chauvin's defense with a video of a May 2019 arrest of Floyd related to previous drug use suggesting that it showed \"a pattern of behavior in which Mr Floyd responded to the police by panicking, implying that he faked his response\" Nelson had previously said in court, \" [Floyd's response] goes to the very nature of this case and why public perception is what it is; the things that he is saying 'I can't breathe.' 'I'm claustrophobic.' Calling out for his Mama.\" [110]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nClosing arguments were made on April 19, 2021, after Cahill announced on April 15 that the \"evidence is now complete for this case\" and instructed the jury [100] [111] For the prosecution, Schleicher opened his statements saying \"His name was George Perry Floyd Jr.\", adding later that Chauvin's behavior \"wasn't policing, this was murder\" [111] For the defense, Nelson said that a \"reasonable police officer would understand this situation\", arguing that \"Floyd was able to overcome the efforts of three police officers while handcuffed\" [111] For the state's rebuttal, Blackwell said that \"reasonable is as reasonable does\", asking jurors to \"believe your eyes\" After the arguments Cahill read the final jury instructions, and the jury retired to deliberate [111]\n\n\nVerdict\nJury deliberation began on April 19, 2021, following closing arguments [112] On April 20, the jury announced it had reached a verdict after ten hours of deliberation [113] Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts, [114] [115] [116] becoming the first white Minnesota police officer to be convicted of murdering a black person It was only the second time an officer has been convicted of murder in Minnesota, the first being the third-degree murder conviction of Somali-American officer Mohamed Noor in the killing of Justine Damond, a white woman [117] According to Nielsen ratings, approximately 18 million viewers across six networks watched the live reading of the verdict [118]\n\n\nMotion for new trial\nConcerns surrounding juror partiality arose following the release of an image of a juror, Brandon Mitchell, wearing a \"BLM\" hat and wearing a t-shirt stating \"Get your knee off our necks\" while participating in a march in Washington, D.C honoring Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I have a dream\" speech [120]\n\n\nSentencing\nChauvin faced a maximum of 40 years in prison, but Minnesota sentencing guidelines suggested a sentence of 12.5 years as Chauvin was a first-time offender with no prior criminal history The state stated that it would ask for a longer sentence than the guidelines recommend due to aggravating factors, including that the murder happened in the presence of children; that Floyd was treated with \"particular cruelty\" by Chauvin; and that Chauvin, as a police officer, \"abused his position of authority\" [122] On May 12, Judge Cahill allowed for the prosecution to seek a greater prison sentence after finding that Chauvin treated Floyd \"with particular cruelty.\" [123] Prosecutors requested a 30-year prison sentence, which was \"twice the upper end of the presumptive sentencing range\" and \"would properly account for the profound impact of Defendant's conduct on the victim, the victim's family, and the community,\" according to a sentencing memo [121] [124] Chauvin's attorney Nelson argued that the former officer should instead receive probation and time served, writing in a filing that \"Mr Chauvin asks the Court to look beyond its findings, to his background, his lack of criminal history, his amenability to probation, to the unusual facts of this case, and to his being a product of a 'broken' system [121] [124]\n\n\nReactions\nProtests, rallies, and marches occurred outside of the courthouse, which officials surrounded with a temporary concrete barrier, metal fencing, and barbed wire in anticipation of civil unrest [136] In early 2021, Minneapolis and Hennepin County officials spent $1 million on fencing and barricades for government buildings and police stations in anticipation of civil unrest during the trial [137] In February 2021, Governor Walz deployed the Minnesota National Guard for trial security and in the event of civil unrest, in response to requests from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter [138]\n\n\nProtests and demonstrations\nProtests, rallies, and marches occurred

Chauvin**\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin was a highly publicized and closely watched case that took place in Hennepin County, Minnesota, in 2021. Chauvin, a former police officer, was accused of murdering George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody on May 25, 2020.\n\n**Background**\n\nDerek Chauvin was one of four officers of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) involved in the arrest of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market. He also served as the field training officer for one of the other officers involved. While Floyd was handcuffed and lying facedown on the street, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds. For part of the time, two other officers knelt on Floyd's back. During the final two minutes, Floyd was motionless and had no pulse.\n\n**Murder of George Floyd**\n\nThe murder of George Floyd was a highly publicized and traumatic event that sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform. On May 25, 2020, Floyd was arrested by the Minneapolis Police Department after allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at a market. During the arrest, Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, despite Floyd's repeated pleas for air. The incident was captured on video, which was later shared widely on social media, showing the severity of the situation.\n\n**Arrest, Charges, and Bail**\n\nChauvin was arrested on May 29, 2020, and initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, making him the first white police officer in Minnesota to be charged with murdering a black civilian. On June 3, charges were amended to include second-degree murder, specifically unintentional second-degree murder while attempting to commit felony assault. Chauvin was released on conditional bail on October 7, 2020, after posting a bond of $1 million. Court documentation provided that his release was supervised and would be forfeited if he declined to appear before a magistrate, refused to appear in court on scheduled dates, left the state of Minnesota without court approval, or had contact with Floyd's family.\n\n**Pre-trial Proceedings**\n\nOn August 29, 2020, Chauvin's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case, claiming that Floyd most likely died as a result of drug use and preexisting medical conditions. On the same day, prosecutors moved to increase potential sentences for the four officers beyond the guidelines for all four accused, arguing that Floyd was vulnerable while being held down on the ground in handcuffs and was treated cruelly.\n\n**Trial**\n\nHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill presided over the case. Cahill has been a judge since 2007 and previously worked as both a public defender and prosecutor. The trial began on March 29, 2021, and lasted for several weeks, with the prosecution presenting its case first. The defense presented its case after, and the prosecution presented a rebuttal.\n\n**Jury**\n\nOn December 22, 2020, prospective jurors in Hennepin County were mailed a questionnaire asking about their views on the criminal justice system, the police, and social movements. The questionnaire also asked prospective jurors to disclose how many times they viewed videos of Floyd's murder and whether they participated in the George Floyd protests.\n\n**Opening Statements**\n\nOpening statements from the prosecution and the defense were heard on March 29, 2021. Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell started opening statements saying that \"Mr Chauvin betrayed his badge\" while defense attorney Eric Nelson said that \"Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do.\" Nelson's opening statement drew attention to the eyewitnesses who watched Floyd's death, who he characterized as an unruly and threatening crowd.\n\n**Prosecution Case**\n\nThe prosecution began its case on March 29, 2021, and rested on April 13 after 11 days of testimony from 38 witnesses. The prosecution's witnesses included body camera footage from the four officers involved, surveillance footage of Floyd at Cup Foods shortly before his murder, and expert testimony from Martin Tobin, an expert in respiratory failure.\n\n**Defense Case**\n\nThe defense began its case on April 13, 2021, and rested on April 15 after two days of testimony from seven witnesses. Chauvin decided not to testify in his own defense, exercising his Fifth Amendment right. The defense's witnesses included footage of Floyd's previous arrest, which suggested that Floyd had a history of panicking and faking responses to the police.\n\n**Closing Arguments**\n\nClosing arguments were made on April 19, 2021, after Cahill announced on April 15 that the \"evidence is now complete for this case\" and instructed the jury. For the prosecution, Schleicher opened his statements saying \"His name was George Perry Floyd Jr.,\" adding later that Chauvin's behavior \"wasn't policing, this was murder.\" For the defense, Nelson said that a \"reasonable police officer would understand this situation,\" arguing that \"Floyd was able to overcome the efforts of three police officers while handcuffed.\" For the state's rebuttal, Blackwell said that \"reasonable is as reasonable does,\" asking jurors to \"believe your eyes.\"\n\n**Verdict**\n\nJury deliberation began on April 19, 2021, following closing arguments. On April 20, the jury announced it had reached a verdict after ten hours of deliberation. Chauvin was found guilty on all three counts, becoming the first white Minnesota police officer to be convicted of murdering a black person.\n\n**Motion for New Trial**\n\nConcerns surrounding juror partiality arose following the release of an image of a juror, Brandon Mitchell, wearing a \"BLM\" hat and wearing a t-shirt stating \"Get your knee off our necks\" while participating in a march in Washington, D.C. honoring Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I have a dream\" speech.\n\n**Sentencing**\n\nChauvin faced a maximum of 40 years in prison, but Minnesota sentencing guidelines suggested a sentence of 12.5 years as Chauvin was a first-time offender with no prior criminal history. The state stated that it would ask for a longer sentence than the guidelines recommend due to aggravating factors, including that the murder happened in the presence of children; that Floyd was treated with \"particular cruelty\" by Chauvin; and that Chauvin, as a police officer, \"abused his position of authority.\" On May 12, Judge Cahill allowed for the prosecution to seek a greater prison sentence after finding that Chauvin treated Floyd \"with particular cruelty.\"\n\n**Reactions**\n\nProtests, rallies, and marches occurred outside of the courthouse, which officials surrounded with a temporary concrete barrier, metal fencing, and barbed wire in anticipation of civil unrest. In early 2021, Minneapolis and Hennepin County officials spent $1 million on fencing and barricades for government buildings and police stations in anticipation of civil unrest during the trial.\n\n**Appeal**\n\nChauvin appealed his conviction to the Minnesota Court of Appeals in mid-2022, asserting that errors in the trial court denied him a fair trial. The case was argued to a three-judge panel on January 18, 2023, and was later affirmed by the Court of Appeals on April 17, 2023. Chauvin then sought review by the Minnesota Supreme Court, but was denied on July 19, 2023.

responded to the police by panicking, implying that he faked his response\" Nelson had previously said in court, \" [Floyd's response] goes to the very nature of this case and why public perception is

[123] Prosecutors requested a 30-year prison sentence, which was \"twice the upper end of the presumptive sentencing range\" and \"would properly account for the profound impact of Defendant's conduct on the victim, the victim's family, and the community,\" according to a sentencing memo [121] [124] Chauvin's attorney Nelson argued that the former officer should instead receive probation and time served, writing in a filing that \"Mr Chauvin asks the Court to look beyond its findings, to his background, his lack of criminal history, his amenability to probation, to the unusual facts of this

{"title": "Vince_Lombardi", "content": "\nEarly life\nLombardi was born on June 11, 1913, in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico \"Harry\" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda \"Mattie\" Izzo (1891–1972) [3] [4] Harry's mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy [5] [6] Mattie's father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata [3] [4] Harry had three siblings, [3] [6] and Matilda had twelve [3] [4] Vince was the oldest of five children, including Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe [4] [7] Both the Lombardi and Izzo clans settled entirely in Sheepshead Bay [3] [8]\n\n\nHigh school\nLombardi graduated from the eighth grade at age 15 in 1928 [8] [21] [note 1] He then enrolled in the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, a division of Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest [8] [21] At Cathedral, he played on the school's baseball and basketball teams, [22] [23] but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight [15] Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral [24] After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood [24] He enrolled at St Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932 [25] [26] [note 2] There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity [27] His performance as a fullback on the Terriers' football team earned him a position on the virtual All-City football team [28] [29]\n\n\nFordham University\nIn 1933, Lombardi received a football scholarship [30] to Fordham University [31] in the Bronx to play for the Fordham Rams and Coach Jim Crowley, who was one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame in the 1920s During his freshman year, Lombardi proved to be an aggressive and spirited player on the football field [32] Prior to the beginning of his sophomore year, Lombardi was projected to start games at the tackle position Lombardi was only 5'8\" and about 180 pounds and was classified as undersized for the position [33]\n\n\nEarly career\nLombardi graduated from Fordham University on June 16, 1937 [41] [42] The nation was still plagued by the Great Depression, so there were few career opportunities for the young Lombardi, and for the next two years, he showed no discernible career path or ambition He tried to play semi-professional football with the Wilmington Clippers [43] of the American Association and worked as a debt collector for a collection agency, but those efforts very quickly proved to be failures With his father's strong support, he enrolled in Fordham Law School in September 1938 Although he did not fail any classes, he believed his grades were so poor that he dropped out after one semester [44] Later in life, he would explain to others that he was close to graduating, but his desire to start and support a family forced him to leave law school and get a job [45] He also joined the Brooklyn Eagles [citation needed]\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1939, Lombardi wanted to marry his girlfriend, Marie Planitz, [46] but he deferred at his father's insistence because he needed a steady job to support himself and a family; he married Marie the following year [47] In 1939, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at St Cecilia, a Catholic high school in Englewood, New Jersey [48] [49] He was offered the position by the school's new head coach, Lombardi's former Fordham teammate, quarterback Andy Palau Palau had just inherited the head coaching position from another Fordham teammate, Nat Pierce (left guard), who had accepted an assistant coach's job back at Fordham In addition to coaching, Lombardi, age 26, taught Latin, chemistry, and physics for an annual salary of under $1,000 [50] [note 4]\n\n\nSt. Cecilia High School\nIn 1939, Lombardi wanted to marry his girlfriend, Marie Planitz, [46] but he deferred at his

the head coaching position from another Fordham teammate, Nat Pierce (left guard), who had accepted an assistant coach's job back at Fordham In addition to coaching, Lombardi, age 26, taught Latin, chemistry, and physics for an annual salary of under $1,000 [50] [note 4]\n\n\nFordham\nIn 1947, Lombardi became the coach of freshman teams in football and basketball at his alma mater, Fordham University The following year, he was an assistant coach for the varsity football team under head coach Ed Danowski, but he was arguably the de facto head coach [53]\n\n\nWest Point\nFollowing the 1948 season, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at the U.S Military Academy at West Point, a position that greatly influenced his future philosophy and system of coaching He was offensive line coach [54] under head coach Earl \"Colonel Red\" Blaik \"As integral as religion was to  [Lombardi's] sense of self, it was not until he reached West Point and combined his spiritual discipline with Blaik's military discipline that his coaching persona began to take its mature form.\" [55] Blaik's emphasis on execution [56] became a trademark of Lombardi's coaching style [57] Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, with varying results The 1949 and 1950 seasons were successful, but the 1951 and 1952 seasons were not, due to the aftermath of a cadet cheating scandal (a violation of the Cadet Honor Code [58]) which was uncovered in spring 1951 By order of the Superintendent, 43 of the 45 members of the varsity football team were discharged from the academy as a result of the scandal [59] \"Decades later, looking back on his rise, Lombardi came to regard ...\" Blaik's decision not to resign \".. as a pivotal moment in his  [own] career\" — it taught him perseverance Blaik himself was and remains a highly controversial figure, in Army football and academic history  [60] After the 1951 and 1952 seasons, not much was expected from the 1953 team as it had also lost six players due to academic misconduct The 1953 team, however, did achieve a 7–1–1 record, as Lombardi had a bigger role than ever in coaching the team [61] Following these five seasons at  Army, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching position with the New York Giants.\n\n\nNew York Giants\nAt age 41 in 1954, Lombardi began his NFL career with the New York Giants He accepted a job that later became known as the offensive coordinator position under new head coach Jim Lee Howell [62] The Giants had finished the previous season under 23-year coach Steve Owen with a 3–9 record By his third season in 1956, Lombardi, along with the defensive coordinator, former All-Pro cornerback turned coach Tom Landry, turned the squad into a championship team, defeating the Chicago Bears 47–7 for the league title \"Howell readily acknowledged the talents of Lombardi and Landry, and joked self-deprecatingly, that his main function was to make sure the footballs had air in them.\" [63] At points in his tenure as an assistant coach at West Point, and as an assistant coach with the Giants, Lombardi worried that he was unable to land a head coaching job due to prejudice against his Italian heritage, [64] especially with respect to Southern colleges [65] Howell wrote numerous recommendations for Lombardi to aid him in obtaining a head coaching position Lombardi applied for head coaching positions at Wake Forest, [66] Notre Dame, and other universities and, in some cases, never received a reply [65] In New York, Lombardi introduced the strategy of rule blocking to the NFL [67] In rule blocking, the offensive lineman would block an area, and not necessarily a particular defensive player, as was the norm up to that time [68] The running back was then expected to run towards any hole that was created Lombardi referred to this as running to daylight [69]\n\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nThe Green Bay Packers, with six future Hall of Famers on the roster in 1958, [70] [note 5] finished at 1–10–1 under head coach Ray McLean, [70] the worst record in Packers history [71] The players were dispirited, [72] the Packers shareholders were disheartened, and the Green Bay community was enraged The angst in Green Bay extended to the NFL as a whole, as the financial viability and the very existence of the Green Bay Packer franchise were in jeopardy On February 2, 1959, Lombardi accepted the position of head coach and general manager of the Packers [73] [74] [75] He demanded and gained full control over the football operations of the community-owned franchise, leaving no doubt of this when he told the franchise's executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command here.\" [76]\n\n\n1959\nThe Green Bay Packers, with six future Hall of

the community-owned franchise, leaving no doubt of this when he told the franchise's executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command here.\" [76]\n\n\n1960–1966\nIn Lombardi's second year in 1960, Green Bay won the NFL Western Conference for the first time since 1944 This victory, along with his well-known religious convictions, [79] led the Green Bay community to anoint Lombardi with the nickname \"The Pope\" [79] Lombardi led the Packers to the 1960 Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles Before the championship game, Lombardi met with Wellington Mara and advised him that he would not take the Giants' head coaching job, which was initially offered after the end of the 1959 season [80] In the final play of the game, in a drive that would have won it, the Packers were stopped a few yards from the goal line Lombardi had suffered his first and only championship game loss After the game, and after the press corps had left the locker room, Lombardi told his team, \"This will never happen again You will never lose another championship.\" [81] In later years as coach of the Packers, Lombardi made it a point to admonish his running backs that if they failed to score from one yard out, he would consider it a personal affront to him and he would seek retribution [82] He coached the Packers to win their next nine post-season games, a record streak not matched or broken until Bill Belichick won ten straight from 2002 to 2006 with New England [83] The Packers defeated the Giants for the NFL title in 1961 (37–0 in Green Bay) and 1962 (16–7 at Yankee Stadium), marking the first two of their five titles in Lombardi's seven years After the 1962 championship victory, President John F Kennedy called Lombardi and asked him if he would \"come back to Army and coach again\" Kennedy received Lombardi's tacit refusal of the request [84] His only other post-season loss occurred to the St Louis Cardinals in the third-place Playoff Bowl after the 1964 season (officially classified as an exhibition game) [85]\n\n\nPackers Sweep\nAs coach of the Packers, Lombardi converted Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung to a full-time halfback Lombardi also designed a play for fullback Jim Taylor: both guards, Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston, pulled to the outside and blocked downfield while Taylor would \"run to daylight\" — i.e., wherever the defenders weren't This was a play that he had originally developed with the Giants for Frank Gifford It soon became known as the Packers sweep (or Lombardi sweep), though Lombardi openly admitted it was based on an old single wing concept [91]\n\n\nIce Bowl\nIn 1967, Lombardi's Packers hosted the Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31 in the NFL Championship Game, a rematch of the previous season [92] This became known as the \"Ice Bowl\" because of the −13 °F (−25 °C) game-time temperature Lombardi had a heating coil underneath the field but on this day it was not functioning Some people believe that he turned it off on purpose With 16 seconds left in the game and down by three points, the Packers called their final time-out It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas two-foot line [93] In the huddle, with the game on the line, quarterback Bart Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes [94] Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball Lombardi, having had enough of the bitter cold, told Starr to 'Run it! And let's get the hell out of here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.' [95] Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, [96] but with him keeping the ball [97] [98] Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and gained victory [99] Shortly after the victory in Super Bowl II, Lombardi resigned as head coach of the Packers on February 1, 1968, continuing as general manager He handed the head coaching position to Phil Bengtson, a longtime assistant, but the Packers finished at 6–7–1 in the 1968 season and were out of the four-team NFL playoffs [100]\n\n\nWashington Redskins\nIn February 1969, Lombardi was let out of his contract with the Packers to become the head coach and executive vice president of the Washington Redskins [101] [102] He was given full control over football operations and a 5% stake in ownership [101] The Redskins finished the 1969 season at 7–5–2, their first winning record since 1955, but Lombardi died shortly before the start of the 1970 season [101] Lombardi was credited with having changed the culture and laying the foundation for Washington's success in the 1970s under George Allen [101] [103] [104]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1934, Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz [105] When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father did not like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, [106] a prejudice he would face more than once in his life [107] [108] Lombardi and Marie wed on August 31, 1940 [109]\n\n\nFamily\nIn 1934, Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz [105] When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father did not like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, [106] a prejudice he would face more than once in his life [107] [108] Lombardi and Marie wed on August 31, 1940 [109]\n\n\nWorld War II deferments\nThough he was 28 years old when the United States entered World War II, Lombardi did not serve in the war He obtained a series of deferments: his first was a 2-A due to his teaching occupation; in 1943, he obtained a second deferment due to parenthood (3-A); and his final deferment was labelled a 4-A and given in 1944 [118]\n\n\nReligion\nThe three constants throughout Lombardi's life were his Roman Catholic religion, his family, and football [119] His father was a daily Communicant throughout his life [14] and his mother's favorite picture of Vince as a child was on his Confirmation [15] When Lombardi was 12, while serving as an altar boy on Easter Sunday, \"... amid the color and pageantry scarlet and white vestments, golden cross, scepters, the wafers and wine, body and blood .. the inspiration came to him that he should become a priest ...\", [15] When his mother, Matty, got wind of it she bragged about her son's plan to her neighbors [23] Lombardi attended Mass on a daily basis throughout his life [120]\n\n\nAnti-discrimination philosophy\n\"Vince Lombardi brought him (Bobby Mitchell) into the front office (in 1969), and he started doing scouting They wanted the black guys to only scout the black schools, and Lombardi said ‘no Bobby’s going to scout ALL the schools, not just the black ones.’”\n\n\nPolitics\nAlthough his wife was a Republican, Lombardi was a lifelong Democrat with liberal views on civil rights: he supported John F Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, Robert F Kennedy in the 1968 primaries, and was also a supporter of Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson [135] [157] Despite this, during the 1960s he became uncomfortable with the burgeoning youth protest movements associated with the emerging counterculture, such as the New Left and the Anti-war movement In a speech that he first delivered in February 1967 to the American Management Association, he suggested that \"everything has been done to strengthen the rights of the individual and at the same time weaken the rights of the church, weaken the rights of the state, and weaken the rights of all authority\" Due to Lombardi's popularity, Richard Nixon once considered him as a possible running mate in the 1968 presidential election but dropped the idea upon learning about Lombardi's support for the Democratic Party [135] [157]\n\n\nIllness and death\nLombardi had suffered from digestive tract problems as early as 1967, and he had refused his doctor's request to undergo a proctoscopic exam [158] On June 24, 1970, Lombardi was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital, and tests \"revealed anaplastic carcinoma in the rectal area of his colon, a fast-growing malignant cancer in which the cells barely resemble their normal appearance\" [159] On July 27, Lombardi was readmitted to Georgetown and exploratory surgery found that the cancer was terminal [160] Lombardi and Marie received family, friends, clergy, players, and former players at his hospital bedside [161] He received a phone call from President Nixon telling Lombardi that all of the U.S was behind him, to which Lombardi replied that he would never give up his fight against his illness [162] On his deathbed, Lombardi told Father Tim that he was not afraid to die, but that he regretted he could not have accomplished more in his life [163] Lombardi died in Washington, D.C at 7:12 a.m on Thursday, September 3, 1970, surrounded by his wife, parents, two children, and six grandchildren He was 57 [164]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1968, Lombardi starred in a half-hour motivational film titled Second Effort, which has been called \"The best-selling training film of all time\" [168] [169]\n\n\nHonors\nSource: [86]\n\n\nHead coaching record\nSource: [86]\n\n\nCoaching tree\nVince Lombardi has worked under one head coach:\n\n\nBooks\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nBooks written about him\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nSee also\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nNotes\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nReferences\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nSources\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nFurther reading\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nExternal links\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Vince Lombardi\n\nVince Lombardi was a renowned American football coach who is best known for his success with the Green Bay Packers in the 1960s. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches in the history of the National Football League (NFL). Lombardi's tenure with the Packers, which spanned from 1959 to 1967, was marked by an unprecedented level of success, including five NFL championships and a reputation for discipline, hard work, and a strong sense of leadership.\n\nEarly Life\n## Early Years\n\nLombardi was born on June 11, 1913, in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico \"Harry\" Lombardi and Matilda \"Mattie\" Izzo. Harry's mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy, while Mattie's father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata.

There, he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity and played on the Terriers' football team, earning a position on the virtual All-City football team.\n\nFordham University\n## Early Years at Fordham\n\nIn 1933, Lombardi received a football scholarship to Fordham University in the Bronx to play for the Fordham Rams and Coach Jim Crowley, who was one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame in the 1920s. During his freshman year, Lombardi proved to be an aggressive and spirited player on the football field. Prior to the beginning of his sophomore year, Lombardi was projected to start games at the tackle position.

Although he did not fail any classes, he believed his grades were so poor that he dropped out after one semester. He also joined the Brooklyn Eagles.\n\nCoaching Career\n## St. Cecilia High School\n\nIn 1939, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at St. Cecilia, a Catholic high school in Englewood, New Jersey. He was offered the position by the school's new head coach, Lombardi's former Fordham teammate, quarterback Andy Palau. Palau had just inherited the head coaching position from another Fordham teammate, Nat Pierce (left guard), who had accepted an assistant coach's job back at Fordham. In addition to coaching, Lombardi, age 26, taught Latin, chemistry, and physics for an annual salary of under $1,000.\n\n## Fordham University (Again)\n\nIn 1947, Lombardi became the coach of freshman teams in football and basketball at his alma mater, Fordham University. The following year, he was an assistant coach for the varsity football team under head coach Ed Danowski, but he was arguably the de facto head coach. Following the 1948 season, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, a position that greatly influenced his future philosophy and system of coaching. He was offensive line coach under head coach Earl \"Colonel Red\" Blaik. Blaik's emphasis on execution became a trademark of Lombardi's coaching style. Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, with varying results.\n\n## Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Green Bay Packers, with six future Hall of Famers on the roster in 1958, finished at 1–10–1 under head coach Ray McLean, the worst record in Packers history. The players were dispirited, the Packers shareholders were disheartened, and the Green Bay community was enraged. The angst in Green Bay extended to the NFL as a whole, as the financial viability and the very existence of the Green Bay Packer franchise were in jeopardy. On February 2, 1959, Lombardi accepted the position of head coach and general manager of the Packers. He demanded and gained full control over the football operations of the community-owned franchise, leaving no doubt of this when he told the franchise's executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command here.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n## Early Marriage\n\nIn 1934, Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father did not like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would face more than once in his life. Lombardi and Marie wed on August 31, 1940.\n\n## Family and World War II\n\nLombardi was 28 years old when the United States entered World War II. He obtained a series of deferments: his first was a 2-A due to his teaching occupation; in 1943, he obtained a second deferment due to parenthood (3-A); and his final deferment was labelled a 4-A and given in 1944. Lombardi's wife, Marie, gave birth to their first child, a son named William, in 1946. They had another child, a son named John, in 1947.\n\n## Faith and Anti-Discrimination\n\nThe three constants throughout Lombardi's life were his Roman Catholic religion, his family, and football. His father was a daily Communicant throughout his life, and his mother's favorite picture of Vince as a child was on his Confirmation. When Lombardi was 12, while serving as an altar boy on Easter Sunday, \"... amid the color and pageantry scarlet and white vestments, golden cross, scepters, the wafers and wine, body and blood ..., the inspiration came to him that he should become a priest ...\" Lombardi attended Mass on a daily basis throughout his life. Lombardi brought Bobby Mitchell into the front office in 1969 and allowed him to scout all the schools, not just the black ones.\n\nIllness and Death\n## Colon Cancer\n\nLombardi had suffered from digestive tract problems as early as 1967, and he had refused his doctor's request to undergo a proctoscopic exam. On June 24, 1970, Lombardi was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital, and tests \"revealed anaplastic carcinoma in the rectal area of his colon, a fast-growing malignant cancer in which the cells barely resemble their normal appearance.\" On July 27, Lombardi was readmitted to Georgetown and exploratory surgery found that the cancer was terminal. Lombardi died in Washington, D.C. at 7:12 a.m on Thursday, September 3, 1970, surrounded by his wife, parents, two children, and six grandchildren.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n## Second Effort\n\nIn 1968, Lombardi starred in a half-hour motivational film titled Second Effort, which has been called \"The best-selling training film of all time.\"\n\nHonors\n## Head Coaching Record\n\nLombardi's head coaching record was 96-34-6, with a winning percentage of .743.\n\nCoaching Tree\n\nBooks\n\nSee Also\n\nReferences", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vince_Lombardi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLombardi was born on June 11, 1913, in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn to Enrico \"Harry\" Lombardi (1889–1971) and Matilda \"Mattie\" Izzo (1891–1972) [3] [4] Harry's mother and father, Vincenzo and Michelina, emigrated from Salerno, Italy [5] [6] Mattie's father and mother, Anthony and Loretta, emigrated from Vietri di Potenza, Basilicata [3] [4] Harry had three siblings, [3] [6] and Matilda had twelve [3] [4] Vince was the oldest of five children, including Madeleine, Harold, Claire, and Joe [4] [7] Both the Lombardi and Izzo clans settled entirely in Sheepshead Bay [3] [8]\n\n\nHigh school\nLombardi graduated from the eighth grade at age 15 in 1928 [8] [21] [note 1] He then enrolled in the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary, a division of Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Brooklyn, a six-year secondary program to become a Catholic priest [8] [21] At Cathedral, he played on the school's baseball and basketball teams, [22] [23] but his performance was hindered by his poor athleticism and eyesight [15] Against school rules, he continued to play football off-campus throughout his studies at Cathedral [24] After completing four years at Cathedral he decided not to pursue the priesthood [24] He enrolled at St Francis Preparatory high school for the fall of 1932 [25] [26] [note 2] There he became a Charter Member of Omega Gamma Delta fraternity [27] His performance as a fullback on the Terriers' football team earned him a position on the virtual All-City football team [28] [29]\n\n\nFordham University\nIn 1933, Lombardi received a football scholarship [30] to Fordham University [31] in the Bronx to play for the Fordham Rams and Coach Jim Crowley, who was one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame in the 1920s During his freshman year, Lombardi proved to be an aggressive and spirited player on the football field [32] Prior to the beginning of his sophomore year, Lombardi was projected to start games at the tackle position Lombardi was only 5'8\" and about 180 pounds and was classified as undersized for the position [33]\n\n\nEarly career\nLombardi graduated from Fordham University on June 16, 1937 [41] [42] The nation was still plagued by the Great Depression, so there were few career opportunities for the young Lombardi, and for the next two years, he showed no discernible career path or ambition He tried to play semi-professional football with the Wilmington Clippers [43] of the American Association and worked as a debt collector for a collection agency, but those efforts very quickly proved to be failures With his father's strong support, he enrolled in Fordham Law School in September 1938 Although he did not fail any classes, he believed his grades were so poor that he dropped out after one semester [44] Later in life, he would explain to others that he was close to graduating, but his desire to start and support a family forced him to leave law school and get a job [45] He also joined the Brooklyn Eagles [citation needed]\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1939, Lombardi wanted to marry his girlfriend, Marie Planitz, [46] but he deferred at his father's insistence because he needed a steady job to support himself and a family; he married Marie the following year [47] In 1939, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at St Cecilia, a Catholic high school in Englewood, New Jersey [48] [49] He was offered the position by the school's new head coach, Lombardi's former Fordham teammate, quarterback Andy Palau Palau had just inherited the head coaching position from another Fordham teammate, Nat Pierce (left guard), who had accepted an assistant coach's job back at Fordham In addition to coaching, Lombardi, age 26, taught Latin, chemistry, and physics for an annual salary of under $1,000 [50] [note 4]\n\n\nSt. Cecilia High School\nIn 1939, Lombardi wanted to marry his girlfriend, Marie Planitz, [46] but he deferred at his

University The following year, he was an assistant coach for the varsity football team under head coach Ed Danowski, but he was arguably the de facto head coach [53]\n\n\nWest Point\nFollowing the 1948 season, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching job at the U.S Military Academy at West Point, a position that greatly influenced his future philosophy and system of coaching He was offensive line coach [54] under head coach Earl \"Colonel Red\" Blaik \"As integral as religion was to  [Lombardi's] sense of self, it was not until he reached West Point and combined his spiritual discipline with Blaik's military discipline that his coaching persona began to take its mature form.\" [55] Blaik's emphasis on execution [56] became a trademark of Lombardi's coaching style [57] Lombardi coached at West Point for five seasons, with varying results The 1949 and 1950 seasons were successful, but the 1951 and 1952 seasons were not, due to the aftermath of a cadet cheating scandal (a violation of the Cadet Honor Code [58]) which was uncovered in spring 1951 By order of the Superintendent, 43 of the 45 members of the varsity football team were discharged from the academy as a result of the scandal [59] \"Decades later, looking back on his rise, Lombardi came to regard ...\" Blaik's decision not to resign \".. as a pivotal moment in his  [own] career\" — it taught him perseverance Blaik himself was and remains a highly controversial figure, in Army football and academic history  [60] After the 1951 and 1952 seasons, not much was expected from the 1953 team as it had also lost six players due to academic misconduct The 1953 team, however, did achieve a 7–1–1 record, as Lombardi had a bigger role than ever in coaching the team [61] Following these five seasons at  Army, Lombardi accepted an assistant coaching position with the New York Giants.\n\n\nNew York Giants\nAt age 41 in 1954, Lombardi began his NFL career with the New York Giants He accepted a job that later became known as the offensive coordinator position under new head coach Jim Lee Howell [62] The Giants had finished the previous season under 23-year coach Steve Owen with a 3–9 record By his third season in 1956, Lombardi, along with the defensive coordinator, former All-Pro cornerback turned coach Tom Landry, turned the squad into a championship team, defeating the Chicago Bears 47–7 for the league title \"Howell readily acknowledged the talents of Lombardi and Landry, and joked self-deprecatingly, that his main function was to make sure the footballs had air in them.\" [63] At points in his tenure as an assistant coach at West Point, and as an assistant coach with the Giants, Lombardi worried that he was unable to land a head coaching job due to prejudice against his Italian heritage, [64] especially with respect to Southern colleges [65] Howell wrote numerous recommendations for Lombardi to aid him in obtaining a head coaching position Lombardi applied for head coaching positions at Wake Forest, [66] Notre Dame, and other universities and, in some cases, never received a reply [65] In New York, Lombardi introduced the strategy of rule blocking to the NFL [67] In rule blocking, the offensive lineman would block an area, and not necessarily a particular defensive player, as was the norm up to that time [68] The running back was then expected to run towards any hole that was created Lombardi referred to this as running to daylight [69]\n\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nThe Green Bay Packers, with six future Hall of Famers on the roster in 1958, [70] [note 5] finished at 1–10–1 under head coach Ray McLean, [70] the worst record in Packers history [71] The players were dispirited, [72] the Packers shareholders were disheartened, and the Green Bay community was enraged The angst in Green Bay extended to the NFL as a whole, as the financial viability and the very existence of the Green Bay Packer franchise were in jeopardy On February 2, 1959, Lombardi accepted the position of head coach and general manager of the Packers [73] [74] [75] He demanded and gained full control over the football operations of the community-owned franchise, leaving no doubt of this when he told the franchise's executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command here.\" [76]\n\n\n1959\nThe Green Bay Packers, with six future Hall of

the community-owned franchise, leaving no doubt of this when he told the franchise's executive committee, \"I want it understood that I am in complete command here.\" [76]\n\n\n1960–1966\nIn Lombardi's second year in 1960, Green Bay won the NFL Western Conference for the first time since 1944 This victory, along with his well-known religious convictions, [79] led the Green Bay community to anoint Lombardi with the nickname \"The Pope\" [79] Lombardi led the Packers to the 1960 Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles Before the championship game, Lombardi met with Wellington Mara and advised him that he would not take the Giants' head coaching job, which was initially offered after the end of the 1959 season [80] In the final play of the game, in a drive that would have won it, the Packers were stopped a few yards from the goal line Lombardi had suffered his first and only championship game loss After the game, and after the press corps had left the locker room, Lombardi told his team, \"This will never happen again You will never lose another championship.\" [81] In later years as coach of the Packers, Lombardi made it a point to admonish his running backs that if they failed to score from one yard out, he would consider it a personal affront to him and he would seek retribution [82] He coached the Packers to win their next nine post-season games, a record streak not matched or broken until Bill Belichick won ten straight from 2002 to 2006 with New England [83] The Packers defeated the Giants for the NFL title in 1961 (37–0 in Green Bay) and 1962 (16–7 at Yankee Stadium), marking the first two of their five titles in Lombardi's seven years After the 1962 championship victory, President John F Kennedy called Lombardi and asked him if he would \"come back to Army and coach again\" Kennedy received Lombardi's tacit refusal of the request [84] His only other post-season loss occurred to the St Louis Cardinals in the third-place Playoff Bowl after the 1964 season (officially classified as an exhibition game) [85]\n\n\nPackers Sweep\nAs coach of the Packers, Lombardi converted Notre Dame quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung to a full-time halfback Lombardi also designed a play for fullback Jim Taylor: both guards, Jerry Kramer and Fuzzy Thurston, pulled to the outside and blocked downfield while Taylor would \"run to daylight\" — i.e., wherever the defenders weren't This was a play that he had originally developed with the Giants for Frank Gifford It soon became known as the Packers sweep (or Lombardi sweep), though Lombardi openly admitted it was based on an old single wing concept [91]\n\n\nIce Bowl\nIn 1967, Lombardi's Packers hosted the Dallas Cowboys in Green Bay on December 31 in the NFL Championship Game, a rematch of the previous season [92] This became known as the \"Ice Bowl\" because of the −13 °F (−25 °C) game-time temperature Lombardi had a heating coil underneath the field but on this day it was not functioning Some people believe that he turned it off on purpose With 16 seconds left in the game and down by three points, the Packers called their final time-out It was 3rd and goal on the Dallas two-foot line [93] In the huddle, with the game on the line, quarterback Bart Starr asked Kramer whether he could get enough traction on the icy turf for a wedge play and Kramer responded with an unequivocal yes [94] Starr came over to Lombardi on the sidelines to discuss the last play and told him he wanted to run a 31 wedge, but with him keeping the ball Lombardi, having had enough of the bitter cold, told Starr to 'Run it! And let's get the hell out of here!' Lombardi was asked by Pat Peppler what play Starr would call, to which Lombardi replied, 'Damned if I know.' [95] Starr returned to the huddle and called a Brown right 31 Wedge, [96] but with him keeping the ball [97] [98] Kramer blocked Jethro Pugh low and Ken Bowman hit Pugh high as Starr followed them into the end zone for the Packer lead and gained victory [99] Shortly after the victory in Super Bowl II, Lombardi resigned as head coach of the Packers on February 1, 1968, continuing as general manager He handed the head coaching position to Phil Bengtson, a longtime assistant, but the Packers finished at 6–7–1 in the 1968 season and were out of the four-team NFL playoffs [100]\n\n\nWashington Redskins\nIn February 1969, Lombardi was let out of his contract with the Packers to become the head coach and executive vice president of the Washington Redskins [101] [102] He was given full control over football operations and a 5% stake in ownership [101] The Redskins finished the 1969 season at 7–5–2, their first winning record since 1955, but Lombardi died shortly before the start of the 1970 season [101] Lombardi was credited with having changed the culture and laying the foundation for Washington's success in the 1970s under George Allen [101] [103] [104]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1934, Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz [105] When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father did not like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, [106] a prejudice he would face more than once in his life [107] [108] Lombardi and Marie wed on August 31, 1940 [109]\n\n\nFamily\nIn 1934, Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor introduced him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz [105] When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father did not like the idea of his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, [106] a prejudice he would face more than once in his life [107] [108] Lombardi and Marie wed on August 31, 1940 [109]\n\n\nWorld War II deferments\nThough he was 28 years old when the United States entered World War II, Lombardi did not serve in the war He obtained a series of deferments: his first was a 2-A due to his teaching occupation; in 1943, he obtained a second deferment due to parenthood (3-A); and his final deferment was labelled a 4-A and given in 1944 [118]\n\n\nReligion\nThe three constants throughout Lombardi's life were his Roman Catholic religion, his family, and football [119] His father was a daily Communicant throughout his life [14] and his mother's favorite picture of Vince as a child was on his Confirmation [15] When Lombardi was 12, while serving as an altar boy on Easter Sunday, \"... amid the color and pageantry scarlet and white vestments, golden cross, scepters, the wafers and wine, body and blood .. the inspiration came to him that he should become a priest ...\", [15] When his mother, Matty, got wind of it she bragged about her son's plan to her neighbors [23] Lombardi attended Mass on a daily basis throughout his life [120]\n\n\nAnti-discrimination philosophy\n\"Vince Lombardi brought him (Bobby Mitchell) into the front office (in 1969), and he started doing scouting They wanted the black guys to only scout the black schools, and Lombardi said ‘no Bobby’s going to scout ALL the schools, not just the black ones.’”\n\n\nPolitics\nAlthough his wife was a Republican, Lombardi was a lifelong Democrat with liberal views on civil rights: he supported John F Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, Robert F Kennedy in the 1968 primaries, and was also a supporter of Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson [135] [157] Despite this, during the 1960s he became uncomfortable with the burgeoning youth protest movements associated with the emerging counterculture, such as the New Left and the Anti-war movement In a speech that he first delivered in February 1967 to the American Management Association, he suggested that \"everything has been done to strengthen the rights of the individual and at the same time weaken the rights of the church, weaken the rights of the state, and weaken the rights of all authority\" Due to Lombardi's popularity, Richard Nixon once considered him as a possible running mate in the 1968 presidential election but dropped the idea upon learning about Lombardi's support for the Democratic Party [135] [157]\n\n\nIllness and death\nLombardi had suffered from digestive tract problems as early as 1967, and he had refused his doctor's request to undergo a proctoscopic exam [158] On June 24, 1970, Lombardi was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital, and tests \"revealed anaplastic carcinoma in the rectal area of his colon, a fast-growing malignant cancer in which the cells barely resemble their normal appearance\" [159] On July 27, Lombardi was readmitted to Georgetown and exploratory surgery found that the cancer was terminal [160] Lombardi and Marie received family, friends, clergy, players, and former players at his hospital bedside [161] He received a phone call from President Nixon telling Lombardi that all of the U.S was behind him, to which Lombardi replied that he would never give up his fight against his illness [162] On his deathbed, Lombardi told Father Tim that he was not afraid to die, but that he regretted he could not have accomplished more in his life [163] Lombardi died in Washington, D.C at 7:12 a.m on Thursday, September 3, 1970, surrounded by his wife, parents, two children, and six grandchildren He was 57 [164]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1968, Lombardi starred in a half-hour motivational film titled Second Effort, which has been called \"The best-selling training film of all time\" [168] [169]\n\n\nHonors\nSource: [86]\n\n\nHead coaching record\nSource: [86]\n\n\nCoaching tree\nVince Lombardi has worked under one head coach:\n\n\nBooks\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nBooks written about him\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nSee also\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nNotes\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nReferences\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nSources\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nFurther reading\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nExternal links\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

striking through the lightly defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks [citation needed]\n\n\nFall of France\nNazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries beginning on 10 May 1940 German forces split the French from their British allies by striking through the lightly defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks [citation needed]\n\n\nArmistice\nPétain signed the Armistice of 22 June Its terms left the French Army under Vichy France a rump Armistice Army [b] The naval fleet, although disabled, remained under Vichy control In the colonial empire, the armistice terms permitted defensive use of the naval fleet In metropolitan France, forces were severely reduced, armored vehicles and tanks prohibited, and motorized transport severely limited.\n\n\nDe Gaulle and Free France\nCharles de Gaulle had been since 5 June the Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War and responsible for coordination with Britain Refusing to accept his government's position on Germany, he escaped back to England on 17 June In London he established a government in exile and in a series of radio appeals exhorted the French to fight back Some historians have called the first, his appeal of 18 June on the BBC, the beginning of the French Resistance In fact the audience for that appeal was quite small, but more and more listened as de Gaulle obtained Britain's recognition as the legitimate government of Free France and obtained their agreement to finance a military efforts against Nazi Germany.\n\n\nFrench Resistance\nThe French Resistance was a decentralized network of small cells of fighters with the tacit or overt support of many French civilians The various resistance groups by 1944 had an estimated 100,000 members in France [18] Some were former Republican fighters from the Spanish Civil War; others were workers who went into hiding rather than report for the mandatory Service du travail obligatoire (STO) to work for German arms factories [c] [20] In the south of France especially, Resistance fighters took to the mountainous brush (maquis) that gave them their name, and conducted guerilla warfare on the German occupation forces, cutting telephone lines and destroying bridges.\n\n\nFrench colonial empire\nFrance's colonial empire at the start of World War II stretched from territories and possessions in Africa, the Middle East (Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon), to ports in India, Indochina, the Pacific islands, and territories in North and South America.\nFrance retained control of its colonial empire, and the terms of the armistice shifted the power balance post-armistice of France's reduced military resources away from France and towards the colonies, especially North Africa By 1943, all French colonies, except for Japanese-controlled Indochina, had joined the Free French cause [23] [24] [page needed]\nThe colonies in North Africa and French Equatorial Africa in particular played a key role [25] [26]\n\n\nDiplomacy, politics, and administration\nRefusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, Charles de Gaulle fled to England on 17 June and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight [28]\n\n\nDiplomacy and politics\nRefusing to

June\nRefusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, Charles de Gaulle fled to England on 17 June and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight [28]\n\n\nNorthern Africa\n{{{annotations}}}\n\n\nFree French Administration\nA series of organizing bodies was created during the war, to guide and coordinate the diplomatic and war effort of Free France, with General Charles de Gaulle playing a central role in the creation or operation of them all.\n\n\nEmpire Defense Council\nOn 26 June 1940, four days after the Pétain government requested the armistice, General de Gaulle submitted a memorandum to the British government notifying Churchill of his decision to set up a Council of Defense of the Empire [39] and formalizing the agreement reached with Churchill on 28 June The formal recognition of the Empire Defense Council as a government in exile by the United Kingdom took place on 6 January 1941; recognition by the Soviet Union was published in December 1941, by exchange of letters [40]\n\n\nFrench National Committee\nWinston Churchill suggested that de Gaulle create a committee, to lend an appearance of a more constitutionally based and less dictatorial authority and on 24 September 1941 de Gaulle created by edict the French National Committee [41] as the successor organization to the smaller Empire Defense Council According to historian Henri Bernard,  [fr] De Gaulle went on to accept his proposal, but took care to exclude all his adversaries within the Free France movement, such as Émile Muselier, André Labarthe and others, retaining only \"yes men\" in the group [41]\n\n\nNational Resistance Council\nDe Gaulle, began seeking the formation of a committee to unify the resistance movements On January 1, 1942, he delegated this task to Jean Moulin Moulin achieved this on May 27, 1943, with the first meeting of the Conseil National de la Résistance in the 6th-arrondissement apartment of René Corbin [44] on the second floor of 48, Rue du Four, in Paris.\n\n\nFrench Civil and Military High Command\nThe French Civil and Military High Command [45] [46] was the governmental body in Algiers headed by Henri Giraud following the liberation of a portion of French North Africa following the Allied Operation Torch landings on 7 and 8 November 1942.\n\n\nFrench Committee of National Liberation\nThe French Committee of National Liberation was a provisional government of Free France formed by generals Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle to provide united leadership, and organize and coordinate the campaign to liberate France The committee was formed on 3 June 1943 and after a period of joint leadership came under the chairmanship of de Gaulle on 9 November [50] The committee directly challenged the legitimacy of the Vichy régime and unified the French forces that fought against the Nazis and their collaborators The committee functioned as a provisional government for French Algeria (then a part of metropolitan France) and the liberated parts of the colonial empire [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nProvisional Consultative Assembly\nThe Provisional Consultative Assembly was set up in September 1943 in Algiers to advise the committee and to help provide a legal basis to the institutions being set up to represent the French people, at a time when the country itself and its laws represented the enemy After the liberation of Paris in August 1944, the Committee moved to Paris and was reorganized as the Provisional Government of the French Republic under the presidency of Charles de Gaulle The Provisional Government guided the French war and diplomatic efforts through liberation and the end of the war, until a new Constitution was written and approved in a referendum, establishing of the Fourth Republic in October 1946.\n\n\nProvisional Government\nThe GPFR served as an interim government of Free France from June 1944 through liberation and lasted till 1946.\n\n\nMilitary forces\nThe first military forces brought to bear in the liberation of France were the forces of Free France, made up of colonial regiments from French Africa The Free French forces included 300,000 North African Arabs [58] Two of the Big Three Allies, the United States and the United Kingdom, were next with Operation Overlord, with Australian air support and Canadian infantry in the Normandy beach landings.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe first military forces brought to bear in the liberation of France were the forces of Free France, made up of colonial regiments from French Africa The Free French forces included 300,000 North African Arabs [58] Two of the Big Three Allies, the United States and the United Kingdom, were next with Operation Overlord, with Australian air support and Canadian infantry in the Normandy beach landings.\n\n\nFree French Forces\nDespite de Gaulle's call to continue the struggle, few French forces initially pledged their support By the end of July 1940, only about 7,000 soldiers had joined the Free French Forces in England [63] [64] Three-quarters of French servicemen in Britain requested repatriation [65]: 80 \n\n\nColonial African forces\nThe contribution to France's liberation made by African colonial soldiers, who comprised 9% of the French army, was long overlooked The North African units, dating from 1830 and grouped into the XIX Army Corps in 1873, formed part of the French Metropolitan Army [73] De Gaulle made a base in African territory, from which he launched the military liberation African troops who made the largest contribution by colonial troops to the liberation [74] [75]\n\n\nIntelligence\nDe Gaulle set up his Free French intelligence system to combine both military and political roles, including covert operations He selected journalist Pierre Brossolette (1903–44) to head the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (BCRA) The policy was reversed in 1943 by Emmanuel d'Astrier, the interior minister of the exile government, who insisted on civilian control of political intelligence [76]\n\n\nAllied forces\nThe \"Big Three\" Allies of World War II, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, all fought Germany in World War II, but Soviet Union fighting on the Eastern Front played no direct role in the liberation of France, but the second front contributed to Nazi defeat.\n\n\nFrench Forces of the Interior\nFrench Forces of the Interior was the formal name given by General de Gaulle to French resistance fighters in the later stages of the war; the change occurred as France, the occupied nation, became France, being liberated by the Allied armies Regional maquis became more formally organized into FFI light infantry and served as a valuable additional manpower for the regular Free French forces.\n\n\nEscape lines\nApproximately 2,000 British and 3,000 American airmen downed in western Europe evaded German capture during the war Airmen were assisted by many different escape lines, some of them large and organized, others informal and ephemeral The Royal Air Forces Escaping Society estimated that 14,000 volunteers worked with the many escape and evasion lines during the war Many others helped on an occasional basis, and the total number of people who, on one or more occasions helped downed airmen during the war, may have reached 100,000 One-half of the volunteer helpers were women, often young women, even teenagers [84]\n\n\nPremature activation\nIn the uplands and forests, considerable numbers of resistance fighters gathered, known as maquisards because of the maquis shrubland that sheltered them These \"redoubts\" of FFI fighters initially kept a low profile, since overt acts of sabotage resulted in savage reprisals by German forces, or direct military action on a large scale On 26 March 1944, the Maquis des Glières in Haute-Savoie were defeated by more than 3,000 troops followed by shootings and burnings of farms amongst the local population [87]\n\n\nAllied military policy\nMilitary strategy for the war as a whole was discussed among the Big Three powers, and especially among the United Kingdom and the United States, who were especially close, with numerous calls and meetings held between U.S President Franklin D Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill In addition, the leaders of the Big Three met at conferences during the war to decide on overall military strategy [91]\n\n\nCampaigns\nAfter the Fall of France, the battle to retake France began in Africa in November 1940 By September 1944, after the liberation of Paris and the southern France campaign and taking of Mediterranean ports in Marseille and Toulon, the country was largely liberated The Allied Forces were driving into Germany from the west and the south The liberation of France didn't finally end till the elimination of some pockets of German resistance along the Atlantic coast at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n\nGabon – November 1940\nThe Battle of Gabon resulted in the Free French Forces taking the colony of French Gabon and its capital, Libreville, from Vichy French forces It was the only significant engagement in Central Africa during the war [citation needed]\n\n\nNorth Africa – November 1942\nOperation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, was carried out to trap Axis forces in North Africa between two Allied armies – an Anglo-American one in the west and a British and Commonwealth one in the east; this would also permit an invasion of Italy and free the Mediterranean for shipping It would be the first ground combat operations for American troops in the west In a three-pronged Allied assault against Vichy régime targets in French North Africa, the landing forces of Operation Torch came in at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers Following Case Anton, French colonial governors had found themselves taking orders from the German military administration, and did so with varying degrees of enthusiasm  The American consul in Algiers believed that Vichy forces would welcome American soldiers.\n\n\nTorch\nOperation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, was carried out to trap Axis

of France since 1881, when it became part of France's colonial empire.\n\n\nCorsica – 1943\nExcept for a brief period, Corsica had been under the control of France since the Treaty of Versailles (1768) In World War II, Corsica was occupied by the Kingdom of Italy from November 1942, through September 1943 [97] Italy initially occupied the island (as well as parts of France) as part of Nazi Germany's Case Anton on 11 November 1942 At its peak, Italy had 85,000 troops on the island [98] There was some native support among Corsican irredentists for the occupation [citation needed] Benito Mussolini postponed the annexation of Corsica by Italy until after an assumed Axis victory in World War II, mainly because of German opposition to the irredentist claims [99]\n\n\nBattle of Normandy – June 1944\nOperation Overlord was launched on 6 June 1944 with troops landing in Normandy Attacks by 1,200 planes preceded an amphibious assault by more than 5,000 vessels Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June.\n\n\nParis – August 1944\nThe Liberation of Paris was an urban military battle that took place over the period of a week from 19 August 1944 until the German garrison surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944 Paris had been ruled by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Armistice on 22 June 1940, after which the Wehrmacht occupied northern and western France.\n\n\nUprising – 15 August\nAs the French Resistance began to rise in Paris against the Germans on 15 August, Eisenhower stated that it was too early for an assault on Paris He was also aware that Hitler had ordered the German military to completely destroy the city in the event of an Allied attack, and Paris was considered to have too great a value, culturally and historically, to risk its destruction.\n\n\nAllied arrival – 24–25 August\nThe liberation began when the FFI staged an uprising against the German garrison upon the approach of General Patton's US Third Army On the night of 24 August, elements of General Philippe Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division made their way into Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville shortly before midnight The next morning, 25 August, the bulk of the 2nd Armored Division and the US 4th Infantry Division and other allied units entered the city von Choltitz surrendered to the French at the Hôtel Meurice, the newly established French headquarters de Gaulle arrived to assume control of the city [citation needed]\n\n\nGerman surrender – 25 August\nDespite repeated orders from Adolf Hitler that the French capital be destroyed before being given up, Choltitz surrendered on 25 August at the Hôtel Meurice He then signed the official surrender at the Paris Police Prefecture Choltitz later described himself in Is Paris Burning? (Brennt Paris?) as the saviour of Paris, for not blowing it up before surrendering [107]\n\n\nSouthern France – August 1944\nWhen first planned, the campaign in southern France and the landings in Normandy were to take place simultaneously—Operation Overlord in Normandy, and \"Anvil\" (as the southern campaign was originally called) in the south of France A dual landing was soon recognized to be impossible; the southern campaign was postponed The ports in Normandy had insufficient capacity to handle Allied military supply needs and French generals under de Gaulle pressed for a direct attack on southern France with the participation of French troops Despite objections by Churchill, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14 July and scheduled for 15 August [111] [112] [113]\n\n\nPlanning and goals\nWhen first planned, the campaign in southern France and the landings in Normandy were to take place simultaneously—Operation Overlord in Normandy, and \"Anvil\" (as the southern campaign was originally called) in the south of France A dual landing was soon recognized to be impossible; the southern campaign was postponed The ports in Normandy had

objections by Churchill, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14 July and scheduled for 15 August [111] [112] [113]\n\n\nEastern France – Autumn 1944\nThe First Canadian Army liberated the French coast from Normandy to the Low Countries Hitler had ordered the troops occupying them to hold them at all costs but using isolation and coordinated bombardment, the ports were reduced.\n\n\nPockets of German resistance – to May 1945\nThe pocket of La Rochelle was a zone of German resistance at the end of the Second World War It was made up of the city of La Rochelle, the submarine base at La Pallice, of the Île de Ré and of most of the Ile d'Oléron (the southern part of the island was part of the Royan pocket).\n\n\nVictory – 7 May 1945\nVictory in Europe was achieved on 7 May 1945 Hitler committed suicide on 30 April during the Battle of Berlin and Germany's surrender was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz leader of the rump administration Flensburg Government The act of military surrender was first signed at 02:41 on 7 May in SHAEF HQ at Reims, [123] and a slightly modified document, considered the definitive German Instrument of Surrender, was signed on 8 May 1945 in Karlshorst, Berlin at 21:20 local time.\n\n\nAftermath\nBy the autumn of 1944, Paris and the northern part of France were in Allied hands following Normandy campaign, and the southern part of France was free in the wake of the success of Operation Dragoon Except for a few Atlantic pockets, the Allies were in full control of France, freeing their military forces to push eastward across the Rhine into Germany and towards Berlin.\n\n\nEnd of Vichy\nUnder pressure from the advancing Allied forces, Pierre Laval held the last government council on 17 August 1944, with five ministers [126] With permission from the Germans, he attempted to call back the prior National Assembly with the goal of giving it power [127] and thus impeding the communists and de Gaulle [128] He obtained the agreement of German ambassador Otto Abetz to bring Édouard Herriot, (President of the Chamber of Deputies) back to Paris [128] But ultra-collaborationists Marcel Déat and Fernand de Brinon protested to the Germans, who changed their minds [129] and took Laval to Belfort on 20 August 1944 [130] along with the remains of his government, \"to assure its legitimate security\", along with Petain, and arrested Herriot [131]\n\n\nJustice and retribution\nImmediately following the liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, public humiliations, assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators, known as the épuration sauvage (wild purge) [141] This period succeeded the German occupational administration but preceded the authority of the French Provisional Government and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice [141] Approximately 9,000 were executed, mostly without trial in summary executions, [141] notably including members and leaders of the pro-Nazi milices In one case, as many as 77 milice members were summarily executed at once [142] An inquest into the issue of summary executions launched by Jules Moch, then Minister of the Interior, came to the conclusion that there had been 9,673 summary executions A second inquiry in 1952 separated out 8,867 executions of suspected collaborators and 1,955 summary executions for which the motive of killing was not known, giving a total of 10,822 executions [citation needed] Shaving the heads of women as a form of humiliation and shaming was a common feature of the purges, [143] and between 10,000 and 30,000 women accused of having collaborated with the Germans or having had relationships with German soldiers or officers were subjected to the practice, [144] becoming known as tonsured women  [fr] (femmes tondues) [145]\n\n\nExtrajudicial purges\nImmediately following the liberation, France was swept by a

humiliation and shaming was a common feature of the purges, [143] and between 10,000 and 30,000 women accused of having collaborated with the Germans or having had relationships with German soldiers or officers were subjected to the practice, [144] becoming known as tonsured women  [fr] (femmes tondues) [145]\n\n\nLegal purge\nThe official épuration légale (\"legal purge\") began following a June 1944 decree that established a three-tier system of judicial courts: [146] a High Court of Justice which dealt with Vichy ministers and officials; Courts of Justice for other serious cases of alleged collaboration; and regular Civic Courts for lesser cases of alleged collaboration [141] [147] Over 700 collaborators were executed following legal trials [148] The initial phase of purge trials ended with a series of amnesty laws passed between 1951 and 1953 [149] which reduced the number of imprisoned collaborators from 40,000 to 62, [150] and was followed by a period of official \"repression\" that lasted between 1954 and 1971 [149]\n\n\nElections of May 1945\nThe French municipal elections of 1945 were held in two rounds on 29 April and 13 May 1945 These were the first elections since the liberation of France and the first in which women could vote [g] Elections did not take place in four departments (Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, Moselle and Territory of Belfort) with recent fighting that had prevented the creation of electoral lists [clarify] In Moselle, they were postponed to 23 and 30 September, at the same time as the cantonal elections, because the end of the fighting was too close [clarify] These difficulties made it very difficult to compile electoral lists that included women, and there were very few by-elections before these historic dates.\n\n\nElection context\nWhile the war was not yet officially over (the German surrender of May 8, 1945 was signed between the two rounds of voting), the elections took place in a difficult political and social context: the economic situation remained very precarious, not all prisoners of war had returned, and many scores were being settled in local political life.\n\n\nProvisional Government of the French Republic\nThe Provisional Government of the French Republic was the successor organization to the French Committee of National Liberation It served as an interim government of Free France between 1944 and 1946, and lasted until the establishment of the Fourth Republic Its founding marked the official restoration and re-establishment of a provisional French Republic, assuring continuity with the defunct Third Republic which dissolved itself in 1940 with the advent of the Vichy regime.\n\n\nFourth Republic\nWith most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less collaborated with Nazi Germany, Gaullism and communism became the most popular political forces in France [154]\n\n\nImpact\nFrance's losses during World War II totaled 600,000 people (1.44% of the population), including 210,000 military deaths from all causes, and 390,000 civilian deaths due to military activity and crimes against humanity [155] In addition they suffered 390,000 wounded military [156]\n\n\nDemographic\nFrance's losses during World War II totaled 600,000 people (1.44% of the population), including 210,000 military deaths from all causes, and 390,000 civilian deaths due to military activity and crimes against humanity [155] In addition they suffered 390,000 wounded military [156]\n\n\nEconomic\nFrance emerged from World War II severely weakened economically  It had been in a period of economic stagnation even when the war broke out [160]: 39   By 1945 national income, in real terms, was little more than half what it had been in 1929 [161]: 233 \n\n\nJudicial\nMany leaders and collaborators of the Vichy regime were arrested, and some were imprisoned or sentenced to death Marshall Petain's death sentence was commuted to life due to his status as a World War I hero [164] Pierre Laval was tried, and executed by firing squad in October 1945 [165]\n\n\nHistoriographical\nFor decades prior to the 1970s modern period, French historiography was dominated by conservative or pro-Communist thinking, neither of them very inclined to consider the grass-roots pro-democracy developments at liberation [168]\n\n\nSocial and cultural\nMany were concerned with getting life back to the way it was, \"a l'identique\", as it was described, but leaders said that modernization was needed [171] As Jean Monnet said, \"We have no choice [171] The only alternative to modernization is decadence.\" The question of what this would look like was not obvious, and was one of the core political issues, from liberation to Algerian independence [171]\n\n\nPolitical\nThe liberation of France had profound effect on the future of French and world politics.\n\n\nSee also\nAllies\n\n\nNotes\nAllies\n\n\nReferences\nAllies\n\n\nWorks

of the country's occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. The liberation was a gradual process that took place in several stages, involving the efforts of the French Resistance, the Allied forces, and the French government in exile.\n\n## Background\n\nIn June 1940, following the Fall of France, the country was divided into two zones: the occupied zone, controlled by Nazi Germany, and the unoccupied zone, controlled by the Vichy regime, a French government that collaborated with the Nazis. The Vichy regime was led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, who had been appointed by President Albert Lebrun as the Prime Minister of France.\n\n## Fall of France\n\nThe Fall of France was a result of the German military offensive, code-named Operation Fall Gelb, which began on May 10, 1940. The German army, led by General Erich von Manstein, struck through the Ardennes forest, a region considered impassable by the French military. The French army, led by General Maurice Gamelin, was quickly overwhelmed, and the country was divided into two zones.\n\n## Armistice\n\nOn June 22, 1940, the Armistice of Compiègne was signed, ending the fighting between France and Germany. The armistice left the French army under Vichy control, while the naval fleet remained under the control of the French government in exile. The armistice terms also allowed for the use of the French colonial empire for defensive purposes.\n\n## De Gaulle and Free France\n\nCharles de Gaulle, a French general and politician, had been appointed as the Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War by the French government in June 1940. De Gaulle refused to accept the armistice and continued to fight against the Nazis. On June 17, 1940, he escaped to England, where he established the Free French Forces, a military organization that would fight alongside the Allies.\n\n## French Resistance\n\nThe French Resistance was a decentralized network of small cells of fighters who opposed the Vichy regime and the Nazi occupation. The resistance movement was made up of various groups, including communists, socialists, and nationalists, who were united in their opposition to the Nazis. The resistance fighters conducted guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and intelligence activities against the occupation forces.\n\n## French colonial empire\n\nFrance's colonial empire, which stretched from Africa to Asia and the Pacific, played a significant role in the liberation of France. The colonies in North Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria, were crucial in the Allied victory. The French colonies in Africa contributed significantly to the Allied war effort, providing troops, supplies, and strategic locations for military operations.\n\n## Diplomacy, politics, and administration\n\nThe French government in exile, led by de Gaulle, was recognized by the Allies as the legitimate government of France. The government in exile was based in London, where de Gaulle established a network of administration, diplomacy, and military coordination. The government in exile worked closely with the Allies to coordinate military operations and provide strategic guidance to the French Resistance.\n\n## Empire Defense Council\n\nThe Empire Defense Council was a council established by de Gaulle to coordinate the defense of the French empire. The council was made up of representatives from the colonies, who worked together to coordinate military operations, supply chains, and strategic planning.\n\n## French National Committee\n\nThe French National Committee was a committee established by de Gaulle to coordinate the efforts of the French Resistance and the government in exile. The committee was made up of representatives from various resistance groups and government agencies, who worked together to coordinate military operations, propaganda, and strategic planning.\n\n## National Resistance Council\n\nThe National Resistance Council was a council established by de Gaulle to unify the resistance movements across France. The council was made up of representatives from various resistance groups, who worked together to coordinate military operations, sabotage, and intelligence activities.\n\n## French Civil and Military High Command\n\nThe French Civil and Military High Command was a governing body established in Algiers, which coordinated the efforts of the French military and civil administration. The high command was made up of representatives from the French government, the military, and the colonies, who worked together to coordinate military operations, supply chains, and strategic planning.\n\n## French Committee of National Liberation\n\nThe French Committee of National Liberation was a provisional government established by de Gaulle to coordinate the efforts of the French Resistance and the government in exile. The committee was made up of representatives from various resistance groups and government agencies, who worked together to coordinate military operations, propaganda, and strategic planning.\n\n## Provisional Consultative Assembly\n\nThe Provisional Consultative Assembly was a consultative body established by de Gaulle to advise the French government in exile. The assembly was made up of representatives from various resistance groups, government agencies, and civil society organizations, who worked together to provide strategic guidance and advice to the government.\n\n## Provisional Government of the French Republic\n\nThe Provisional Government of the French Republic was a government established by de Gaulle to coordinate the efforts of the French Resistance and the government in exile. The government was made up of representatives from various resistance groups and government agencies, who worked together to coordinate military operations, propaganda, and strategic planning.\n\n## Liberation of France\n\nThe liberation of France was a gradual process that took place in several stages. The first stage was the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942, which marked the beginning of the end of the Vichy regime. The second stage was the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944, which marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation. The final stage was the Allied invasion of northern France in September 1944, which marked the end of the Nazi occupation and the liberation of France.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe liberation of France was followed by a period of reconstruction and rebuilding. The French government in exile, led by de Gaulle, played a significant role in the reconstruction efforts, working closely with the Allies to coordinate the rebuilding of the country.

Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks [citation needed]\n\n\nFall of France\nNazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries beginning on 10 May 1940 German forces split the French from their British allies by striking through the lightly defended Ardennes, whose topography French strategists had considered prohibitively difficult for tanks [citation needed]\n\n\nArmistice\nPétain signed the Armistice of 22 June Its terms left the French Army under Vichy France a rump Armistice Army [b] The naval fleet, although disabled, remained under Vichy control In the colonial empire, the armistice terms permitted defensive use of the naval fleet In metropolitan France, forces were severely reduced, armored vehicles and tanks prohibited, and motorized transport severely limited.\n\n\nDe Gaulle and Free France\nCharles de Gaulle had been since 5 June the Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War and responsible for coordination with Britain Refusing to accept his government's position on Germany, he escaped back to England on 17 June In London he established a government in exile and in a series of radio appeals exhorted the French to fight back Some historians have called the first, his appeal of 18 June on the BBC, the beginning of the French Resistance In fact the audience for that appeal was quite small, but more and more listened as de Gaulle obtained Britain's recognition as the legitimate government of Free France and obtained their agreement to finance a military efforts against Nazi Germany.\n\n\nFrench Resistance\nThe French Resistance was a decentralized network of small cells of fighters with the tacit or overt support of many French civilians The various resistance groups by 1944 had an estimated 100,000 members in France [18] Some were former Republican fighters from the Spanish Civil War; others were workers who went into hiding rather than report for the mandatory Service du travail obligatoire (STO) to work for German arms factories [c] [20] In the south of France especially, Resistance fighters took to the mountainous brush (maquis) that gave them their name, and conducted guerilla warfare on the German occupation forces, cutting telephone lines and destroying bridges.\n\n\nFrench colonial empire\nFrance's colonial empire at the start of World War II stretched from territories and possessions in Africa, the Middle East (Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon), to ports in India, Indochina, the Pacific islands, and territories in North and South America.\nFrance retained control of its colonial empire, and the terms of the armistice shifted the power balance post-armistice of France's reduced military resources away from France and towards the colonies, especially North Africa By 1943, all French colonies, except for Japanese-controlled Indochina, had joined the Free French cause [23] [24] [page needed]\nThe colonies in North Africa and French Equatorial Africa in particular played a key role [25] [26]\n\n\nDiplomacy, politics, and administration\nRefusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, Charles de Gaulle fled to England on 17 June and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight [28]\n\n\nDiplomacy and politics\nRefusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, Charles de

Charles de Gaulle fled to England on 17 June and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight [28]\n\n\nNorthern Africa\n{{{annotations}}}\n\n\nFree French Administration\nA series of organizing bodies was created during the war, to guide and coordinate the diplomatic and war effort of Free France, with General Charles de Gaulle playing a central role in the creation or operation of them all.\n\n\nEmpire Defense Council\nOn 26 June 1940, four days after the Pétain government requested the armistice, General de Gaulle submitted a memorandum to the British government notifying Churchill of his decision to set up a Council of Defense of the Empire [39] and formalizing the agreement reached with Churchill on 28 June The formal recognition of the Empire Defense Council as a government in exile by the United Kingdom took place on 6 January 1941; recognition by the Soviet Union was published in December 1941, by exchange of letters [40]\n\n\nFrench National Committee\nWinston Churchill suggested that de Gaulle create a committee, to lend an appearance of a more constitutionally based and less dictatorial authority and on 24 September 1941 de Gaulle created by edict the French National Committee [41] as the successor organization to the smaller Empire Defense Council According to historian Henri Bernard,  [fr] De Gaulle went on to accept his proposal, but took care to exclude all his adversaries within the Free France movement, such as Émile Muselier, André Labarthe and others, retaining only \"yes men\" in the group [41]\n\n\nNational Resistance Council\nDe Gaulle, began seeking the formation of a committee to unify the resistance movements On January 1, 1942, he delegated this task to Jean Moulin Moulin achieved this on May 27, 1943, with the first meeting of the Conseil National de la Résistance in the 6th-arrondissement apartment of René Corbin [44] on the second floor of 48, Rue du Four, in Paris.\n\n\nFrench Civil and Military High Command\nThe French Civil and Military High Command [45] [46] was the governmental body in Algiers headed by Henri Giraud following the liberation of a portion of French North Africa following the Allied Operation Torch landings on 7 and 8 November 1942.\n\n\nFrench Committee of National Liberation\nThe French Committee of National Liberation was a provisional government of Free France formed by generals Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle to provide united leadership, and organize and coordinate the campaign to liberate France The committee was formed on 3 June 1943 and after a period of joint leadership came under the chairmanship of de Gaulle on 9 November [50] The committee directly challenged the legitimacy of the Vichy régime and unified the French forces that fought against the Nazis and their collaborators The committee functioned as a provisional government for French Algeria (then a part of metropolitan France) and the liberated parts of the colonial empire [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nProvisional Consultative Assembly\nThe Provisional Consultative Assembly was set up in September 1943 in Algiers to advise the committee and to help provide a legal basis to the institutions being set up to represent the French people, at a time when the country itself and its laws represented the enemy After the liberation of Paris in August 1944, the Committee moved to Paris and was reorganized as the Provisional Government of the French Republic under the presidency of Charles de Gaulle The Provisional Government guided the French war and diplomatic efforts through liberation and the end of the war, until a new Constitution was written and approved in a referendum, establishing of the Fourth Republic in October 1946.\n\n\nProvisional Government\nThe GPFR served as an interim government of Free France from June 1944 through liberation and lasted till 1946.\n\n\nMilitary forces\nThe first military forces brought to bear in the liberation of France were the forces of Free France, made up of colonial regiments from French Africa The Free French forces included 300,000 North African Arabs [58] Two of the Big Three Allies, the United States and the United Kingdom, were next with Operation Overlord, with Australian air support and Canadian infantry in the Normandy beach landings.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe first military forces brought to bear in the liberation of France were the forces of Free France, made up of colonial regiments from French Africa The Free French forces included 300,000 North African Arabs [58] Two of the Big Three Allies, the United States and the United Kingdom, were next with Operation Overlord, with Australian air support and Canadian infantry in the Normandy beach landings.\n\n\nFree French Forces\nDespite de Gaulle's call to continue the struggle, few French forces initially pledged their support By the end of July 1940, only about 7,000 soldiers had joined the Free French Forces in England [63] [64] Three-quarters of French servicemen in Britain requested repatriation [65]: 80 \n\n\nColonial African forces\nThe contribution to France's liberation made by African colonial soldiers, who comprised 9% of the French army, was long overlooked The North African units, dating from 1830 and grouped into the XIX Army Corps in 1873, formed part of the French Metropolitan Army [73] De Gaulle made a base in African territory, from which he launched the military liberation African troops who made the largest contribution by colonial troops to the liberation [74] [75]\n\n\nIntelligence\nDe Gaulle set up his Free French intelligence system to combine both military and political roles, including covert operations He selected journalist Pierre Brossolette (1903–44) to head the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (BCRA) The policy was reversed in 1943 by Emmanuel d'Astrier, the interior minister of the exile government, who insisted on civilian control of political intelligence [76]\n\n\nAllied forces\nThe \"Big Three\" Allies of World War II, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, all fought Germany in World War II, but Soviet Union fighting on the Eastern Front played no direct role in the liberation of France, but the second front contributed to Nazi defeat.\n\n\nFrench Forces of the Interior\nFrench Forces of the Interior was the formal name given by General de Gaulle to French resistance fighters in the later stages of the war; the change occurred as France, the occupied nation, became France, being liberated by the Allied armies Regional maquis became more formally organized into FFI light infantry and served as a valuable additional manpower for the regular Free French forces.\n\n\nEscape lines\nApproximately 2,000 British and 3,000 American airmen downed in western Europe evaded German capture during the war Airmen were assisted by many different escape lines, some of them large and organized, others informal and ephemeral The Royal Air Forces Escaping Society estimated that 14,000 volunteers worked with the many escape and evasion lines during the war Many others helped on an occasional basis, and the total number of people who, on one or more occasions helped downed airmen during the war, may have reached 100,000 One-half of the volunteer helpers were women, often young women, even teenagers [84]\n\n\nPremature activation\nIn the uplands and forests, considerable numbers of resistance fighters gathered, known as maquisards because of the maquis shrubland that sheltered them These \"redoubts\" of FFI fighters initially kept a low profile, since overt acts of sabotage resulted in savage reprisals by German forces, or direct military action on a large scale On 26 March 1944, the Maquis des Glières in Haute-Savoie were defeated by more than 3,000 troops followed by shootings and burnings of farms amongst the local population [87]\n\n\nAllied military policy\nMilitary strategy for the war as a whole was discussed among the Big Three powers, and especially among the United Kingdom and the United States, who were especially close, with numerous calls and meetings held between U.S President Franklin D Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill In addition, the leaders of the Big Three met at conferences during the war to decide on overall military strategy [91]\n\n\nCampaigns\nAfter the Fall of France, the battle to retake France began in Africa in November 1940 By September 1944, after the liberation of Paris and the southern France campaign and taking of Mediterranean ports in Marseille and Toulon, the country was largely liberated The Allied Forces were driving into Germany from the west and the south The liberation of France didn't finally end till the elimination of some pockets of German resistance along the Atlantic coast at the end of the war in May 1945.\n\n\nGabon – November 1940\nThe Battle of Gabon resulted in the Free French Forces taking the colony of French Gabon and its capital, Libreville, from Vichy French forces It was the only significant engagement in Central Africa during the war [citation needed]\n\n\nNorth Africa – November 1942\nOperation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, was carried out to trap Axis forces in North Africa between two Allied armies – an Anglo-American one in the west and a British and Commonwealth one in the east; this would also permit an invasion of Italy and free the Mediterranean for shipping It would be the first ground combat operations for American troops in the west In a three-pronged Allied assault against Vichy régime targets in French North Africa, the landing forces of Operation Torch came in at Casablanca, Oran and Algiers Following Case Anton, French colonial governors had found themselves taking orders from the German military administration, and did so with varying degrees of enthusiasm  The American consul in Algiers believed that Vichy forces would welcome American soldiers.\n\n\nTorch\nOperation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, was carried out to trap Axis forces in North Africa between two Allied armies – an Anglo-American one in

1943\nExcept for a brief period, Corsica had been under the control of France since the Treaty of Versailles (1768) In World War II, Corsica was occupied by the Kingdom of Italy from November 1942, through September 1943 [97] Italy initially occupied the island (as well as parts of France) as part of Nazi Germany's Case Anton on 11 November 1942 At its peak, Italy had 85,000 troops on the island [98] There was some native support among Corsican irredentists for the occupation [citation needed] Benito Mussolini postponed the annexation of Corsica by Italy until after an assumed Axis victory in World War II, mainly because of German opposition to the irredentist claims [99]\n\n\nBattle of Normandy – June 1944\nOperation Overlord was launched on 6 June 1944 with troops landing in Normandy Attacks by 1,200 planes preceded an amphibious assault by more than 5,000 vessels Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on 6 June.\n\n\nParis – August 1944\nThe Liberation of Paris was an urban military battle that took place over the period of a week from 19 August 1944 until the German garrison surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944 Paris had been ruled by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Armistice on 22 June 1940, after which the Wehrmacht occupied northern and western France.\n\n\nUprising – 15 August\nAs the French Resistance began to rise in Paris against the Germans on 15 August, Eisenhower stated that it was too early for an assault on Paris He was also aware that Hitler had ordered the German military to completely destroy the city in the event of an Allied attack, and Paris was considered to have too great a value, culturally and historically, to risk its destruction.\n\n\nAllied arrival – 24–25 August\nThe liberation began when the FFI staged an uprising against the German garrison upon the approach of General Patton's US Third Army On the night of 24 August, elements of General Philippe Leclerc's 2nd Armored Division made their way into Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville shortly before midnight The next morning, 25 August, the bulk of the 2nd Armored Division and the US 4th Infantry Division and other allied units entered the city von Choltitz surrendered to the French at the Hôtel Meurice, the newly established French headquarters de Gaulle arrived to assume control of the city [citation needed]\n\n\nGerman surrender – 25 August\nDespite repeated orders from Adolf Hitler that the French capital be destroyed before being given up, Choltitz surrendered on 25 August at the Hôtel Meurice He then signed the official surrender at the Paris Police Prefecture Choltitz later described himself in Is Paris Burning? (Brennt Paris?) as the saviour of Paris, for not blowing it up before surrendering [107]\n\n\nSouthern France – August 1944\nWhen first planned, the campaign in southern France and the landings in Normandy were to take place simultaneously—Operation Overlord in Normandy, and \"Anvil\" (as the southern campaign was originally called) in the south of France A dual landing was soon recognized to be impossible; the southern campaign was postponed The ports in Normandy had insufficient capacity to handle Allied military supply needs and French generals under de Gaulle pressed for a direct attack on southern France with the participation of French troops Despite objections by Churchill, the operation was authorized by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff on 14 July and scheduled for 15 August [111] [112] [113]\n\n\nPlanning and goals\nWhen first planned, the campaign in southern France and the landings in Normandy were to take place simultaneously—Operation Overlord in Normandy,

Canadian Army liberated the French coast from Normandy to the Low Countries Hitler had ordered the troops occupying them to hold them at all costs but using isolation and coordinated bombardment, the ports were reduced.\n\n\nPockets of German resistance – to May 1945\nThe pocket of La Rochelle was a zone of German resistance at the end of the Second World War It was made up of the city of La Rochelle, the submarine base at La Pallice, of the Île de Ré and of most of the Ile d'Oléron (the southern part of the island was part of the Royan pocket).\n\n\nVictory – 7 May 1945\nVictory in Europe was achieved on 7 May 1945 Hitler committed suicide on 30 April during the Battle of Berlin and Germany's surrender was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz leader of the rump administration Flensburg Government The act of military surrender was first signed at 02:41 on 7 May in SHAEF HQ at Reims, [123] and a slightly modified document, considered the definitive German Instrument of Surrender, was signed on 8 May 1945 in Karlshorst, Berlin at 21:20 local time.\n\n\nAftermath\nBy the autumn of 1944, Paris and the northern part of France were in Allied hands following Normandy campaign, and the southern part of France was free in the wake of the success of Operation Dragoon Except for a few Atlantic pockets, the Allies were in full control of France, freeing their military forces to push eastward across the Rhine into Germany and towards Berlin.\n\n\nEnd of Vichy\nUnder pressure from the advancing Allied forces, Pierre Laval held the last government council on 17 August 1944, with five ministers [126] With permission from the Germans, he attempted to call back the prior National Assembly with the goal of giving it power [127] and thus impeding the communists and de Gaulle [128] He obtained the agreement of German ambassador Otto Abetz to bring Édouard Herriot, (President of the Chamber of Deputies) back to Paris [128] But ultra-collaborationists Marcel Déat and Fernand de Brinon protested to the Germans, who changed their minds [129] and took Laval to Belfort on 20 August 1944 [130] along with the remains of his government, \"to assure its legitimate security\", along with Petain, and arrested Herriot [131]\n\n\nJustice and retribution\nImmediately following the liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, public humiliations, assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators, known as the épuration sauvage (wild purge) [141] This period succeeded the German occupational administration but preceded the authority of the French Provisional Government and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice [141] Approximately 9,000 were executed, mostly without trial in summary executions, [141] notably including members and leaders of the pro-Nazi milices In one case, as many as 77 milice members were summarily executed at once [142] An inquest into the issue of summary executions launched by Jules Moch, then Minister of the Interior, came to the conclusion that there had been 9,673 summary executions A second inquiry in 1952 separated out 8,867 executions of suspected collaborators and 1,955 summary executions for which the motive of killing was not known, giving a total of 10,822 executions [citation needed] Shaving the heads of women as a form of humiliation and shaming was a common feature of the purges, [143] and between 10,000 and 30,000 women accused of having collaborated with the Germans or having had relationships with German soldiers or officers were subjected to the practice, [144] becoming known as tonsured women  [fr] (femmes tondues) [145]\n\n\nExtrajudicial purges\nImmediately following the liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, public humiliations, assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators, known as the épuration sauvage (wild purge) [141] This period succeeded the German occupational administration but preceded the authority of the French Provisional Government and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice [141] Approximately 9,000 were executed, mostly without trial in summary executions, [141] notably including members and leaders of the pro-Nazi milices In one case, as many as 77 milice members were summarily executed at once [142] An inquest into the issue of summary executions launched by Jules Moch, then Minister of the Interior, came to the conclusion that there had been 9,673 summary executions A second inquiry in 1952 separated out 8,867 executions of suspected collaborators and 1,955 summary executions for which the motive of killing was not known, giving a total of 10,822 executions [citation needed] Shaving the heads of women as a form of humiliation and shaming was a common feature of the purges, [143] and between 10,000 and 30,000 women accused of having collaborated with the Germans or having had relationships with German soldiers or officers were subjected to the practice, [144] becoming known as tonsured women  [fr] (femmes tondues) [145]\n\n\nLegal purge\nThe official épuration légale (\"legal purge\") began following a June 1944 decree that established a three-tier system of judicial courts: [146] a High Court of Justice which dealt with Vichy ministers and officials; Courts of Justice for other serious cases of alleged collaboration; and regular Civic Courts for lesser cases of alleged collaboration [141] [147] Over 700 collaborators were executed following legal trials [148] The initial phase of purge trials ended with a series of amnesty laws passed between 1951 and 1953 [149] which reduced the number of imprisoned collaborators from 40,000 to 62, [150] and was followed by a period of official \"repression\" that lasted between 1954 and 1971 [149]\n\n\nElections of May 1945\nThe French municipal elections of 1945 were held in two rounds on 29 April and 13 May 1945 These were the first elections since the liberation of France and the first in which women could vote [g] Elections did not take place in four departments (Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, Moselle and Territory of Belfort) with recent fighting that had prevented the creation of electoral lists [clarify] In Moselle, they were postponed to 23 and 30 September, at the same time as the cantonal elections, because the end of the fighting was too close [clarify] These difficulties made it very difficult to compile electoral lists that included women, and there were very few by-elections before these historic dates.\n\n\nElection context\nWhile the war was not yet officially over (the German surrender of May 8, 1945 was signed between the two rounds of voting), the elections took place in a difficult political and social context: the economic situation remained very precarious, not all prisoners of war had returned, and many scores were being settled in local political life.\n\n\nProvisional Government of the French Republic\nThe Provisional Government of the French Republic was the successor organization to the French Committee of National Liberation It served as an interim government of Free France between 1944 and 1946, and lasted until the establishment of the Fourth Republic Its founding marked the official restoration and re-establishment of a provisional French Republic, assuring continuity with the defunct Third Republic which dissolved itself in 1940 with the advent of the Vichy regime.\n\n\nFourth Republic\nWith most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less collaborated with Nazi Germany, Gaullism and communism became the most popular political forces in France [154]\n\n\nImpact\nFrance's losses during World War II totaled 600,000 people (1.44% of the population), including 210,000 military deaths from all causes, and 390,000 civilian deaths due to military activity and crimes against humanity [155] In addition they suffered 390,000 wounded military [156]\n\n\nDemographic\nFrance's losses during World War II totaled 600,000 people (1.44% of the population), including 210,000 military deaths from all causes, and 390,000 civilian deaths due to military activity and crimes against humanity [155] In addition they suffered 390,000 wounded military [156]\n\n\nEconomic\nFrance emerged from World War II severely weakened economically  It had been in a period of economic stagnation even when the war broke out [160]: 39   By 1945 national income, in real terms, was little more than half what it had been in 1929 [161]: 233 \n\n\nJudicial\nMany leaders and collaborators of the Vichy regime were arrested, and some were imprisoned or sentenced to death Marshall Petain's death sentence was commuted to life due to his status as a World War I hero [164] Pierre Laval was tried, and executed by firing squad in October 1945 [165]\n\n\nHistoriographical\nFor decades prior to the 1970s modern period, French historiography was dominated by conservative or pro-Communist thinking, neither of them very inclined to consider the grass-roots pro-democracy developments at liberation [168]\n\n\nSocial and cultural\nMany were concerned with getting life back to the way it was, \"a l'identique\", as it was described, but leaders said that modernization was needed [171] As Jean Monnet said, \"We have no choice [171] The only alternative to modernization is decadence.\" The question of what this would look like was not obvious, and was one of the core political issues, from liberation to Algerian independence [171]\n\n\nPolitical\nThe liberation of France had profound effect on the future of French and world politics.\n\n\nSee also\nAllies\n\n\nNotes\nAllies\n\n\nReferences\nAllies\n\n\nWorks

considered the most prestigious title in the sport. It is held annually by the International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) and is considered the pinnacle of achievement for competitive bodybuilders.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Mr. Olympia competition has a rich history that dates back to 1965, when it was first held in New York City. The first winner of the competition was Larry Scott, a famous bodybuilder of the time who would go on to win the title again in 1966. Scott retired after his 1966 victory, and to date is the only Mr. Olympia champion to have never lost a Mr. Olympia competition.\n\nIn the 1970s, Arnold Schwarzenegger dominated the competition, winning the title a record seven times between 1970 and 1980. Schwarzenegger's victories were marked by his incredible physique, charisma, and dominance in the sport. His most notable victories came in 1975, when he won the competition at the age of 24, and 1980, when he came out of retirement to win the title for the seventh time.\n\n**1970s**\n\nSchwarzenegger's victories in the 1970s cemented his status as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time. He defeated Lou Ferrigno in 1973 and Franco Columbu in 1974, before winning the competition for the fifth time in 1975. Schwarzenegger's victory in 1975 was highlighted in the 1977 docudrama Pumping Iron, which featured other notable bodybuilders such as Serge Nubret and Lou Ferrigno.\n\n**1980s**\n\nIn 1980, Schwarzenegger came out of retirement to win the Olympia yet again, after a five-year hiatus. Schwarzenegger (who was supposedly training for the film Conan the Barbarian) had been a late entry into the competition, and his competitors did not know of his intentions to compete. This seventh victory was especially controversial, as most fellow competitors and observers felt that he lacked both muscle mass and conditioning, and shouldn't have won over Chris Dickerson or Mike Mentzer.\n\n**1990s**\n\nLee Haney dominated the competition in the 1990s, winning the title a record eight consecutive times between 1984 and 1991. Haney retired from competitive bodybuilding after his last Mr. Olympia victory in 1991, and was succeeded by Dorian Yates, who won the competition six straight times from 1992 until 1997.\n\n**2000s**\n\nRonnie Coleman won the Mr. Olympia competition eight consecutive times from 1998 to 2005, tying the record set by Lee Haney. Coleman, nicknamed \"The King\", is widely regarded as the greatest bodybuilder in Olympia history and began the mass monster era.\n\n**2010s**\n\nIn 2010, Jay Cutler returned to claim his fourth Mr. Olympia title, becoming the fifth competitor in Olympia history to win the title more than three times. Cutler's victories were marked by his incredible consistency and ability to adapt to the changing bodybuilding landscape.\n\n**2020s**\n\nIn 2020, Phil Heath returned for an attempted record-tying eighth title, but was defeated by Mamdouh Elssbiay, who won the Olympia for his first title. Elssbiay won for the second time in 2021, cementing his status as one of the greatest bodybuilders of the modern era. Hadi Choopan won in 2022, Derek Lunsford won in 2023, and Samson Dauda won in 2024.\n\n**Qualifying**\n\nThe IFBB selects Olympia contestants from among the highest-placed competitors at various qualifying competitions, collectively referred to as the Olympia Qualifying Season.

It is a unique letter that has a rich history, cultural significance, and widespread use across different languages and cultures.\n\n**History**\n\nHistorically, the letter Ñ arose as a ligature of two n's, with the tilde symbol written over the first n to indicate the doubling of the sound. This ligature was used in the early Spanish language, and it has its roots in the Latin language, where the macron was used to indicate simple doubling of consonants. Over time, the tilde became an integral part of the Spanish alphabet, and it has been used to represent the palatal nasal sound in many languages.\n\n**Cross-linguistic usage**\n\nThe letter Ñ is used in many languages, including Spanish, Philippine languages, Aymara, Quechua, Mapudungún, Guarani, Basque, Chamorro, Leonese, Yavapai, and Iñupiaq. In these languages, the Ñ represents the palatal nasal sound, which is a unique sound that is not found in many other languages. The use of the Ñ is not limited to these languages, and it is also used in many other languages that have been influenced by Spanish, such as those spoken in Senegal.\n\nThe use of the Ñ in these languages is not a coincidence, as many of them have been influenced by Spanish, which has been a dominant language in the region for centuries. The Ñ has become a symbol of Hispanic culture and identity, and it is often used to represent the language and its speakers.\n\n**Cultural significance**\n\nThe letter Ñ has come to represent the identity of the Spanish language and its speakers. It is a unique symbol that is often used to represent Hispanic culture and its influence on other languages and cultures. In the United States, the term \"Generation Ñ\" was coined to refer to the Hispanic generation that is growing up in the country, and it is often used to describe the cultural and linguistic identity of this generation.\n\nThe Instituto Cervantes and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists have adopted the letter as their mark for Hispanic heritage, and it is often used in their publications and events. The use of the Ñ is not limited to these organizations, and it is also used in many other contexts to represent Hispanic culture and identity.\n\n**Computer usage**\n\nIn computer systems, the letter Ñ is represented by the Unicode character U+00D1 (decimal 209) for uppercase and U+00F1 (decimal 241) for lowercase. This character can be generated using the keyboard by typing the letter N or n followed by a combining tilde modifier, &#x303, U+0303, decimal 771.\n\nThe Ñ is also used in internationalized domain names, but it will have to be converted from Unicode to ASCII using Punycode during the registration process.

[81] [82] [83] Four other pieces of work that Einstein completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy—have led to the year being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics akin to 1666 (the year in which Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies) The publications deeply impressed Einstein's contemporaries [84]\n\n\n1908–1933: Early academic career\nEinstein's sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zürich's luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship [85] Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire [86] [87] His time in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers [88]\n\n\n1919: Putting general relativity to the test\nIn 1907, Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's photosphere (that is, the Sun's apparent surface) He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime By the fall of 1915, his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (a slow drift in the point in Mercury's elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely) [50] [100] A total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919 provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test, and observations performed by Sir Arthur Eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations Eddington's work was reported at length in newspapers around the world On 7 November 1919, for example, the leading British newspaper, The Times, printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\" [101]\n\n\n1921–1923: Coming to terms with fame\nWith Eddington's eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, Einstein became \"perhaps the world's first celebrity scientist\", a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists' understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century [102]\n\n\n1922–1932: Serving the League of Nations\nFrom 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, Einstein was a member of the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, a group set up by the League to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries [114] [115] He was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists, Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker, they created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine [116] Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee [117]\n\n\n1925: Touring South America\nIn March and April 1925, Einstein and his wife visited South America, where they spent about a week in Brazil, a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina [118] Their tour was suggested by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935) [119] with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones and was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution [120]\n\n\n1930–1931: Touring the US\nIn December 1930, Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States, drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology Caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the US in 1921, and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him But he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested [121]\n\n\n1933: Emigration to the US\nIn February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler [127] [128]\n\n\nRefugee status\nIn April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities [130] Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed [133]\n\n\nResident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study\nOn 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout [136] Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, [142] [145] noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany [146] At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s [146]\n\n\nWorld War II and the Manhattan Project\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research The group's warnings were discounted Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" [152] [153] To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered [154] He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\n\n\nUS citizenship\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940 Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\" without social barriers As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education [161]\n\n\nPersonal views\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party [167] [168] Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\" [169] [170] His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \"well-regulated system of government\" and called their rule a \"regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\" He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:\n\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party [167] [168] Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why

terror and a tragedy in human history\" He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:\n\n\nRelationship with Zionism\nEinstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, [177] which opened in 1925 [178] Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university [179] He made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country's development [180] He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic [181]\n\n\nReligious and philosophical views\nPer Lee Smolin, \"I believe what allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality He simply cared far more than most of his colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature coherently and consistently.\" [187] Einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews [188] He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy [189] He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve [190] He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\", [191] preferring to call himself an agnostic, [192] [193] or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\" [190] He wrote that \"A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort.\" [194]\n\n\nLove of music\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age In his late journals he wrote:\n\n\nDeath\nOn 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948 [207] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it [208]\n\n\nScientific career\nThroughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles [19] [217] He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones [13] [217] On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents [218] [219]  In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others [220] [221]\n\n\nStatistical mechanics\nEinstein's first paper [79] [222] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\" Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena [222]\n\n\nThermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics\nEinstein's first paper [79] [222] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\" Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena [222]\n\n\nTheory of critical opalescence\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue [223] Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n\n1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers\nThe Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905 These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter The four papers are:\n\n\nSpecial relativity\nEinstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" [228] (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics [232] Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light) The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n\nGeneral relativity\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915 According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape [236]\n\n\nGeneral relativity and the equivalence principle\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915 According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape [236]\n\n\nGravitational waves\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, [241] [242] ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\n\n\nHole argument and Entwurf theory\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only [250]\n\n\nPhysical cosmology\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole [252] He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe [253] [254]\n\n\nEnergy momentum pseudotensor\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason [268]\n\n\nWormholes\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges [270] [271] His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\" These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches Because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles However, it was later found that Einstein–Rosen bridges are not stable [272]\n\n\nEinstein–Cartan theory\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n\nEquations of motion\nIn general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\" [273] [274] The Einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy The geodesic equation covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime Einstein regarded this as an \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains disputed [275] [276]\n\n\nOld quantum theory\nIn a 1905 paper, [224] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta) Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\n\n\nPhotons and energy quanta\nIn a 1905 paper, [224] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta) Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\n\n\nQuantized atomic vibrations\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics Peter Debye refined this model [278]\n\n\nBose–Einstein statistics\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures [279] It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder [280] Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University [220]\n\n\nWave–particle duality\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern [281] In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles This paper introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n\nZero-point energy\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\" Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data The numbers matched nicely However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy [282]\n\n\nStimulated emission\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser [283]\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws [284]\n\n\nMatter waves\nEinstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first In another major paper from this era, Einstein observed that de Broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of Bohr and Sommerfeld This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926 [285] [286]\n\n\nQuantum mechanics\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\" [287] Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete [288]\n\n\nEinstein's objections to quantum mechanics\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\" [287] Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete [288]\n\n\nBohr versus Einstein\n The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science [289] [290] [291] Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\n\nEinstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox\nEinstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930 Einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other The quantum-mechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the Schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question Because the true \"physical condition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it [292] [293]\n\n\nUnified field theory\nEncouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity In 1950, he described his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\" [300] His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death Although most researchers now believe that Einstein's approach to unifying physics was mistaken, his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire [301]\n\n\nOther investigations\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.\n\n\nCollaboration with other scientists\nIn addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n\nEinstein–de Haas experiment\nIn 1908, Owen Willans Richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate This effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials [302] Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect [303] [304] Measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons The Einstein-de Haas experiment is the only experiment concived, realized and published by Albert Einstein himself.\n\n\nEinstein as an inventor\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input [307] On 11 November 1930, U.S patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux [note 6]\n\n\nLegacy\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986 [312]) Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 [313]\n\n\nNon-scientific\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters

general theory of relativity in 1919 [320] [321] [322] Although most of the public had little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and admired In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\" Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else: \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\" [323]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\" None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922 [8]\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nScientific\n\n\nOthers\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a renowned German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and matter. His groundbreaking theories, which include the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity, have had a profound impact on the development of modern physics. Einstein's work has been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. This article provides an overview of Einstein's life, work, and legacy.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879, to Hermann and Pauline Einstein. His father was an engineer and salesman, and his mother was a homemaker. Einstein's early education took place in Munich, where he developed a passion for mathematics and physics. In 1894, he moved to Switzerland to attend the Swiss Federal Polytechnic University, where he studied physics and mathematics.\n\nEinstein's family moved to Italy in 1895, where he worked as a patent clerk for the Swiss Patent Office. During this time, he developed his theory of special relativity, which he published in 1905. The theory posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. This theory challenged the long-held notion of absolute time and space.\n\nIn 1908, Einstein became a lecturer at the University of Bern, where he taught physics and mathematics. He continued to work on his theory of general relativity, which he published in 1915. The theory describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.\n\n**1905 – Annus Mirabilis Papers**\n\nEinstein's 1905 papers, which include the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, and Brownian motion, are known as the Annus Mirabilis papers. These papers were published in the journal Annalen der Physik and revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and matter.\n\n**Special Relativity**\n\nEinstein's special theory of relativity posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another. This theory challenged the long-held notion of absolute time and space. The theory was developed in response to the Michelson-Morley experiment, which failed to detect the presence of a luminiferous ether.\n\n**General Relativity**\n\nEinstein's general theory of relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. The theory posits that gravity is not a force, but rather the result of the curvature of spacetime. This theory was developed in response to the problem of gravity as a force that acts across a distance.\n\n**Einstein's Equivalence Principle**\n\nEinstein's equivalence principle states that the effects of gravity are equivalent to the effects of acceleration. This principle is the foundation of general relativity and has been widely accepted as a fundamental aspect of the theory.\n\n**Unified Field Theory**\n\nEinstein's unified field theory was an attempt to unify the forces of nature, including gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. The theory was developed in the 1920s and 1930s, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n**Other Investigations**\n\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.\n\n**Collaboration with Other Scientists**\n\nEinstein collaborated with other scientists on various projects, including the development of the theory of general relativity.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEinstein's legacy is immense. His work has had a profound impact on the development of modern physics and has influenced many other fields, including astronomy and engineering. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, including the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was also awarded the Copley Medal in 1925 and the Max Planck Medal in 1929.\n\n**Publications**\n\nEinstein published numerous papers and books on physics and mathematics.

[81] [82] [83] Four other pieces of work that Einstein completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy—have led to the year being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics akin to 1666 (the year in which Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies) The publications deeply impressed Einstein's contemporaries [84]\n\n\n1908–1933: Early academic career\nEinstein's sabbatical as a civil servant approached its end in 1908, when he secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that he gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to Zürich's luring him away from Bern with a newly created associate professorship [85] Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when he accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required him to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire [86] [87] His time in Prague saw him producing eleven research papers [88]\n\n\n1919: Putting general relativity to the test\nIn 1907, Einstein reached a milestone on his long journey from his special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of his equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that the field exists In 1911, he used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as it passed close to the Sun's photosphere (that is, the Sun's apparent surface) He reworked his calculation in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime By the fall of 1915, his reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and he applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (a slow drift in the point in Mercury's elliptical orbit at which it approaches the Sun most closely) [50] [100] A total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919 provided an opportunity to put his theory of gravitational lensing to the test, and observations performed by Sir Arthur Eddington yielded results that were consistent with his calculations Eddington's work was reported at length in newspapers around the world On 7 November 1919, for example, the leading British newspaper, The Times, printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\" [101]\n\n\n1921–1923: Coming to terms with fame\nWith Eddington's eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, Einstein became \"perhaps the world's first celebrity scientist\", a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists' understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century [102]\n\n\n1922–1932: Serving the League of Nations\nFrom 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, Einstein was a member of the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, a group set up by the League to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with their counterparts in other countries [114] [115] He was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists, Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny Einstein the place on the committee reserved for a Swiss thinker, they created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine [116] Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee [117]\n\n\n1925: Touring South America\nIn March and April 1925, Einstein and his wife visited South America, where they spent about a week in Brazil, a week in Uruguay and a month in Argentina [118] Their tour was suggested by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935) [119] with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones and was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution [120]\n\n\n1930–1931: Touring the US\nIn December 1930, Einstein began another significant sojourn in the United States, drawn back to the US by the offer of a two month research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology Caltech supported him in his wish that he should not be exposed to quite as much attention from the media as he had experienced when visiting the US in 1921, and he therefore declined all the invitations to receive prizes or make speeches that his admirers poured down upon him But he remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with him that they requested [121]\n\n\n1933: Emigration to the US\nIn February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler [127] [128]\n\n\nRefugee status\nIn April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities [130] Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed [133]\n\n\nResident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study\nOn 3 October 1933, Einstein delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting he was wildly cheered throughout [136] Four days later he returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, [142] [145] noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany [146] At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s [146]\n\n\nWorld War II and the Manhattan Project\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research The group's warnings were discounted Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" [152] [153] To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered [154] He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\n\n\nUS citizenship\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940 Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\" without social barriers As a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his early education [161]\n\n\nPersonal views\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party [167] [168] Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\" [169] [170] His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \"well-regulated system of government\" and called their rule a \"regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\" He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:\n\n\nPolitical views\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the signatories of the founding proclamation of the

terror and a tragedy in human history\" He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:\n\n\nRelationship with Zionism\nEinstein was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, [177] which opened in 1925 [178] Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university [179] He made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country's development [180] He also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic [181]\n\n\nReligious and philosophical views\nPer Lee Smolin, \"I believe what allowed Einstein to achieve so much was primarily a moral quality He simply cared far more than most of his colleagues that the laws of physics have to explain everything in nature coherently and consistently.\" [187] Einstein expounded his spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews [188] He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy [189] He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve [190] He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\", [191] preferring to call himself an agnostic, [192] [193] or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\" [190] He wrote that \"A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe—a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort.\" [194]\n\n\nLove of music\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age In his late journals he wrote:\n\n\nDeath\nOn 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948 [207] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it [208]\n\n\nScientific career\nThroughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles [19] [217] He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones [13] [217] On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents [218] [219]  In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others [220] [221]\n\n\nStatistical mechanics\nEinstein's first paper [79] [222] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\" Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena [222]\n\n\nThermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics\nEinstein's first paper [79] [222] submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\" Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena [222]\n\n\nTheory of critical opalescence\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue [223] Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n\n1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers\nThe Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905 These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter The four papers are:\n\n\nSpecial relativity\nEinstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" [228] (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics [232] Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light) The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\n\nGeneral relativity\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915 According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape [236]\n\n\nGeneral relativity and the equivalence principle\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915 According to it, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by those masses General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape [236]\n\n\nGravitational waves\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, [241] [242] ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\n\n\nHole argument and Entwurf theory\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only [250]\n\n\nPhysical cosmology\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole [252] He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, into the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe [253] [254]\n\n\nEnergy momentum pseudotensor\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason [268]\n\n\nWormholes\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges [270] [271] His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\" These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches Because these solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that they could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles However, it was later found that Einstein–Rosen bridges are not stable [272]\n\n\nEinstein–Cartan theory\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n\nEquations of motion\nIn general relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\" [273] [274] The Einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of the theory, relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy The geodesic equation covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime Einstein regarded this as an \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in addition to the field equations in order to complete the theory Believing this to be a shortcoming in how general relativity was originally presented, he wished to derive it from the field equations themselves Since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law Accordingly, Einstein proposed that the field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but this claim remains disputed [275] [276]\n\n\nOld quantum theory\nIn a 1905 paper, [224] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta) Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\n\n\nPhotons and energy quanta\nIn a 1905 paper, [224] Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta) Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\n\n\nQuantized atomic vibrations\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics Peter Debye refined this model [278]\n\n\nBose–Einstein statistics\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures [279] It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder [280] Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University [220]\n\n\nWave–particle duality\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern [281] In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles This paper introduced the photon concept and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n\nZero-point energy\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\" Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data The numbers matched nicely However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy [282]\n\n\nStimulated emission\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser [283]\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws [284]\n\n\nMatter waves\nEinstein discovered Louis de Broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first In another major paper from this era, Einstein observed that de Broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of Bohr and Sommerfeld This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926 [285] [286]\n\n\nQuantum mechanics\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\" [287] Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete [288]\n\n\nEinstein's objections to quantum mechanics\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\" [287] Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete [288]\n\n\nBohr versus Einstein\n The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science [289] [290] [291] Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\n\nEinstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox\nEinstein never fully accepted quantum mechanics While he recognized that it made correct predictions, he believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible Over the years he presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one he preferred most dated to a debate with Bohr in 1930 Einstein suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other The quantum-mechanical description of the two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction If the wavefunction that describes the two objects before their interaction is given, then the Schrödinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes them after their interaction But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away it is Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the second object Einstein reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the second instantaneously fast Indeed, he argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call that into question Because the true \"physical condition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first, Einstein concluded, the wavefunction could not be that true physical condition, only an incomplete description of it [292] [293]\n\n\nUnified field theory\nEncouraged by his success with general relativity, Einstein sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity In 1950, he described his unified field theory in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\" [300] His attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won him praise but not success: a particularly conspicuous blemish of his model was that it did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after his death Although most researchers now believe that Einstein's approach to unifying physics was mistaken, his goal of a theory of everything is one to which his successors still aspire [301]\n\n\nOther investigations\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.\n\n\nCollaboration with other scientists\nIn addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n\nEinstein–de Haas experiment\nIn 1908, Owen Willans Richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause this body to rotate This effect is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials [302] Einstein and Wander Johannes de Haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of the effect [303] [304] Measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization These measurements also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons The Einstein-de Haas experiment is the only experiment concived, realized and published by Albert Einstein himself.\n\n\nEinstein as an inventor\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input [307] On 11 November 1930, U.S patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, but the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux [note 6]\n\n\nLegacy\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986 [312]) Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 [313]\n\n\nNon-scientific\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters

general theory of relativity in 1919 [320] [321] [322] Although most of the public had little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and admired In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\" Eventually he came to cope with unwanted enquirers by pretending to be someone else: \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\" [323]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\" None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922 [8]\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nScientific\n\n\nOthers\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Kate_Beckinsale", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nKathrin Romany Beckinsale was born on 26 July 1973 in the Chiswick district of London, [4] [5] the only child of actors Richard Beckinsale and Judy Loe [6] She has a half-sister from her father's earlier marriage, actress Samantha Beckinsale [6] Her father was partly of Burmese descent [7] [8] Her parents did not marry until 1977, prior to Beckinsale starting nursery school, [9] when she made her first television appearance at age four, in an episode of This Is Your Life, dedicated to her father [10] When she was five, her father died suddenly of a heart attack, aged 31 She was deeply traumatised by the loss and \"started expecting bad things to happen.\" [11] [6]\n\n\nCareer\nBeckinsale decided at a young age she wanted to be an actress: \"I grew up immersed in film My family were in the business I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends' parents.\" [24] She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau [25] She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P D James' Devices and Desires [26] In 1992, she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in \"Rachel's Dream,\" a 30‑minute Channel 4 short [27] In 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs [28]\n\n\n1991–1997: Early acting roles\nBeckinsale decided at a young age she wanted to be an actress: \"I grew up immersed in film My family were in the business I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends' parents.\" [24] She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau [25] She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P D James' Devices and Desires [26] In 1992, she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in \"Rachel's Dream,\" a 30‑minute Channel 4 short [27] In 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs [28]\n\n\n1998–2002: Move to Hollywood\nAt this point in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, something she has said wasn't \"a conscious decision.. My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films.\" [60] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco The Whit Stillman film focused on a group of mostly Ivy League and Hampshire College graduates socialising in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s Beckinsale's American accent was widely praised [61] [62] [63] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was \"beautifully played.\" [64] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that \"compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can get on your nerves even if the actress doesn't.\" [65] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award [66] The film grossed $3 million worldwide [67]\n\n\n2003–2006: Action roles\nBeckinsale became known as an action star after playing a vampire in 2003's Underworld The film was markedly different from her previous work, and Beckinsale has said she was grateful for the change of pace after appearing in \"a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies,\" [100] adding that \"It was quite a challenge for me to play an action heroine and pull off all that training when  [in real life] I can't catch a ball if it's coming my way.\" [101] The film received negative to mixed reviews but was a surprise box-office hit and has gained a cult following [102] Also in 2003, she starred in the little seen Tiptoes with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey [103]\n\n\n2007–2008: Focus on small-scale drama\nBeckinsale then made a return to smaller-scale projects: \"My experience is that I sort of stepped away from the independent movies and did a couple of big movies But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand.\" [121] \"I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person  [but] it's not something that I would like to do solely.\" [122] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles – it was \"assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers\" [123] – but that her action career \"kind of took off a little too much.\" [124]\n\n\n2009–2015: Return to action films\nIn 2009, Beckinsale starred in the comic-book adaption Whiteout, as a US Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada [124] She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because \"three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit.\" [124] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget [142] With critics consensus: Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold [142] She also made a brief cameo in the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans; she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld [143]\n\n\n2016–present: Love & Friendship and beyond\nIn the 2016 romantic comedy Love & Friendship, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Beckinsale reunited with her Last Days of Disco collaborators Stillman and Sevigny Based on Jane Austen's Lady Susan, the film revolved around her role as the title character, a wry and calculating widow, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself The film was universally acclaimed by critics [179] and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas [180] Justin Chang of Variety described the role as \"one of the most satisfying screen roles of her career [...] Beckinsale magnetizes the screen in a way that naturally underscores how far ahead of everyone else she is: an effect that doesn't always work to the movie's advantage.\" [181] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, \"There aren't great depths to the role, but Beckinsale excels with the long speeches and in defining her character as a very self-aware egoist.\" [182]\n\n\nModelling\nLabelled an \"English rose\" by the BBC as early as 2001, [201] Beckinsale has worked occasionally as a model In 1997, she appeared in the music video for George Michael's \"Waltz Away Dreaming\" [66] She starred opposite Orlando Bloom in a 2002 Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe [202] She appeared in a Diet Coke television advertisement in 2004, directed by Michel Gondry [203] [204] She advertised Absolut Vodka in a 2009 print campaign photographed by Ellen von Unwerth [205] [206]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBeckinsale was in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Sheen from 1995 to 2003 They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards [207] [208] [209] In 1997, they voiced an audiobook production of Romeo and Juliet [58] Their daughter Lily Mo Sheen was born in 1999 [210] [211] In 2001, Beckinsale said she was \"embarrassed\" that Sheen never proposed, [44] [212] but felt as though she was married [213] They broke up in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld [214] Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends.\nShe remarked in 2016, \"He's really dear, close family He's somebody I've known since I was 21 years old I really love him a lot.\" [215]\n\n\nRelationships\nBeckinsale was in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Sheen from 1995 to 2003 They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards [207] [208] [209] In 1997, they voiced an audiobook production of Romeo and Juliet [58] Their daughter Lily Mo Sheen was born in 1999 [210] [211] In 2001, Beckinsale said she was \"embarrassed\" that Sheen never proposed, [44] [212] but felt as though she was married [213] They broke up in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld [214] Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends.\nShe remarked in 2016, \"He's really dear, close family He's somebody I've known since I was 21 years old I really love him a lot.\" [215]\n\n\nPersonal and political beliefs\nBeckinsale is a smoker [226] When she was nine, her mother moved in with Roy Battersby, and his sons introduced her to cigarettes [17]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn July 2003, the Press Complaints Commission dismissed a complaint filed by Beckinsale She alleged that the tabloid Daily Mail had invaded her and her daughter's privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her then-boyfriend Len Wiseman [231] The article in question was headlined, \"Mummy's latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed\" and included a picture in which her then-four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother's romantic actions [231] The Commission found that \"the photographs had been taken in a public place and did not reveal any private details about Lily—such as her health or schooling—but were restricted to general observations about her apparent reaction to her surroundings.\" [231]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nThe British Heart Foundation has been Beckinsale's charity of choice \"ever since  [she] was six years old\" [234] [235] when her father, who had coronary artery disease, died of a massive heart attack She has also donated film memorabilia to the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation, [236] [237] MediCinema, [238] Habitat For Humanity [239] and the Entertainment Industry Foundation [240] In 2008, she hosted the 4th Annual Pink Party to raise funds for the Women's Cancer Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center [241] and organised a screening of All About Eve for FilmAid International [242] In 2012, Beckinsale joined Nestlé's Share the Joy of Reading Program to raise awareness about the importance of people's literacy [243]\n\n\nFilmography\nExcept for her two appearances on the 1975 British daytime marriage counseling drama Couples, [264] which was made before the BBC began to archive all of its productions and so

My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films.\" [60] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco The Whit Stillman film focused on a group of mostly Ivy League and Hampshire College graduates socialising in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s Beckinsale's American accent was widely praised [61] [62] [63] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was \"beautifully played.\" [64] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that \"compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can get on your nerves even if the actress doesn't.\" [65] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award [66] The film grossed $3 million worldwide [67]\n\n\n2003–2006: Action roles\nBeckinsale became known as an action star after playing a vampire in 2003's Underworld The film was markedly different from her previous work, and Beckinsale has said she was grateful for the change of pace after appearing in \"a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies,\" [100] adding that \"It was quite a challenge for me to play an action heroine and pull off all that training when  [in real life] I can't catch a ball if it's coming my way.\" [101] The film received negative to mixed reviews but was a surprise box-office hit and has gained a cult following [102] Also in 2003, she starred in the little seen Tiptoes with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey [103]\n\n\n2007–2008: Focus on small-scale drama\nBeckinsale then made a return to smaller-scale projects: \"My experience is that I sort of stepped away from the independent movies and did a couple of big movies But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand.\" [121] \"I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person  [but] it's not something that I would like to do solely.\" [122] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles – it was \"assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers\" [123] – but that her action career \"kind of took off a little too much.\" [124]\n\n\n2009–2015: Return to action films\nIn 2009, Beckinsale starred in the comic-book adaption Whiteout, as a US Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada [124] She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because \"three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit.\" [124] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget [142] With critics consensus: Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold [142] She also made a brief cameo in the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans; she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld [143]\n\n\n2016–present: Love & Friendship and beyond\nIn the 2016 romantic comedy Love & Friendship, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Beckinsale reunited with her Last Days of Disco collaborators Stillman and Sevigny Based on Jane Austen's Lady Susan, the film revolved around her role as the title character, a wry and calculating widow, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself The film was universally acclaimed by critics [179] and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas [180] Justin Chang of Variety described the role as \"one of the most satisfying screen roles of her career [...] Beckinsale magnetizes the screen in a way that naturally underscores how far ahead of everyone else she is: an effect that doesn't always work to the movie's advantage.\" [181] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, \"There aren't great depths to the role, but Beckinsale excels with the long speeches and in defining her character as a very self-aware egoist.\" [182]\n\n\nModelling\nLabelled an \"English rose\" by the BBC as early as 2001, [201] Beckinsale has worked occasionally as a model In 1997, she appeared in the music video for George Michael's \"Waltz Away Dreaming\" [66] She starred opposite Orlando Bloom in a 2002 Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe [202] She appeared in a Diet Coke television advertisement in 2004, directed by Michel Gondry [203] [204] She advertised Absolut Vodka in a 2009 print campaign photographed by Ellen von Unwerth [205] [206]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBeckinsale was in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Sheen from 1995 to 2003 They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards [207] [208] [209] In 1997, they voiced an audiobook production of Romeo and Juliet [58] Their daughter Lily Mo Sheen was born in 1999 [210] [211] In 2001, Beckinsale said she was \"embarrassed\" that Sheen never proposed, [44] [212] but felt as though she was married [213] They broke up in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld [214] Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends.\nShe remarked in 2016, \"He's really dear, close family He's somebody I've known since I was 21 years old I really love him a lot.\" [215]\n\n\nRelationships\nBeckinsale was in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Sheen from 1995 to 2003 They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards [207] [208] [209] In 1997, they voiced an audiobook production of Romeo and Juliet [58] Their daughter Lily Mo Sheen was born in 1999 [210] [211] In 2001, Beckinsale said she was \"embarrassed\" that Sheen never proposed, [44] [212] but felt as though she was married [213] They broke up in

really love him a lot.\" [215]\n\n\nPersonal and political beliefs\nBeckinsale is a smoker [226] When she was nine, her mother moved in with Roy Battersby, and his sons introduced her to cigarettes [17]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn July 2003, the Press Complaints Commission dismissed a complaint filed by Beckinsale She alleged that the tabloid Daily Mail had invaded her and her daughter's privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her then-boyfriend Len Wiseman [231] The article in question was headlined, \"Mummy's latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed\" and included a picture in which her then-four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother's romantic actions [231] The Commission found that \"the photographs had been taken in a public place and did not reveal any private details about Lily—such as her health or schooling—but were restricted to general observations about her apparent reaction to her surroundings.\" [231]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nThe British Heart Foundation has been Beckinsale's charity of choice \"ever since  [she] was six years old\" [234] [235] when her father, who had coronary artery disease, died of a massive heart attack She has also donated film memorabilia to the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation, [236] [237] MediCinema, [238] Habitat For Humanity [239] and the Entertainment

New polling centres were planned in the constituencies having more than 1,500 registered voters, as well as polling booths in six constituencies of Muzaffarnagar, Budhana, Purkazi, Khatoli, Charthawal, and Midanpur, to be raised from 1,769 to 1,819 booths. Voter assistance booths were set up, and photo slips of voters in a new design were sent to them. First-time, the Form-2B would contain the photograph of the candidates and their nationality.\n\n**Electoral Process Changes**\n\nIn addition to the changes mentioned above, the Election Commission also made several other changes to the electoral process for the 2017 Assembly elections. These included the use of Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines, which would provide voters with a paper trail of their votes, and the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) with a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in all polling stations. The Election Commission also introduced a new system of voter identification, which would use the Aadhaar card as a primary means of identification for voters.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nAssembly elections in Uttar Pradesh were held between 11 February and 8 March 2017. The term of the outgoing government ended on 27 May 2017.\n\n**Predictions**\n\nVarious organisations and agencies had been conducting opinion polls to predict voter intentions in the upcoming legislative assembly elections. The opinion polls suggested that the BJP was likely to emerge as the winner, with the SP and BSP trailing behind. However, the outcome of the election was unpredictable, and many analysts believed that the BSP could still pose a challenge to the BJP's dominance.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nVarious organisations and agencies had been conducting opinion polls to predict voter intentions in the upcoming legislative assembly elections.

Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran had published an exit poll promoting the BJP, after the first phase of the election. This led to the editor being arrested for violating the ban on exit polls during the election.\n\n**Result**\n\nThe election results for all 403 Legislative Assembly seats were declared on 11 March 2017. The BJP emerged as the winner, securing 325 seats. The SP won 47 seats, while the BSP won 19 seats. The INC won 7 seats, and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won 1 seat.\n\n**Region-wise**\n\nAfter the BJP emerged as the majority party in the election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the public in a tweet saying, \"Gratitude to the people of India for the continued faith, support and affection for the BJP.

She is the wife of Gomez Addams and the mother of Wednesday, Pugsley, and Pubert Addams.\n\n**Cartoons**\n\nMorticia is the central figure in the Addams Family cartoons, created by Charles Addams for The New Yorker magazine in the 1930s. She is depicted as a beautiful, elegant, and refined woman with a dry wit and a subtle sense of humor. Her character is characterized by her low voice, incisive language, and subtle smile. Morticia is often shown to be indulgent of the family's often sinister activities, but also feels the need to rein in the more extreme behavior of her husband and children. Her costume is always the same, a form-fitting black gown, tattered or cut to ribbons at the elbows and feet, which has become an iconic part of her character.\n\nMorticia's character is also notable for her romantic side, as she is often shown to be passionate about her garden of deadly nightshade, henbane, and dwarf's hair. She is a thoughtful hostess and has a fierce loyalty to her family. Her voice is never raised, but has great range, and she is contemptuous of clichés, except when used for comedic effect.\n\n**Background**\n\nMorticia is the wife of Gomez Addams and the mother of Wednesday, Pugsley, and Pubert Addams. The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for The New Yorker magazine in the 1930s. In the cartoons, none of the family members had names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 television series, Charles Addams' selection of her name was inspired by \"mortician.\" Morticia's maiden name is \"Frump\" and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by Carolyn Jones in the original TV series). In the television series, her mother is Hester Frump (played by Margaret Hamilton).\n\nIn the 1990s Addams Family films, familial relationships are changed for the characters of Grandmama and Fester. Grandmama is actually Morticia's mother, not Gomez's, while Fester is Gomez's brother, not Morticia's uncle. This change is a significant alteration to the original character and family dynamics.\n\n**In other media**\n\nMorticia was portrayed by Carolyn Jones in the 1964 TV series, as well as in the 1977 TV movie \"Halloween with the New Addams Family.\" Jones' portrayal of Morticia is iconic and has become synonymous with the character. In the TV series, Morticia is descended from Salem, Massachusetts, as revealed in the episode \"The Addams Family Tree\" (Season 1, Episode 5).\n\nIn the 1990s Addams Family films, Morticia's character is reimagined by Anjelica Huston. Huston brings a new level of sophistication and wit to the character, while still maintaining the essence of Morticia's original personality.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nMorticia's relationships with her family members are central to her character. She is married to Gomez Addams, a charming and eccentric man who loves his family dearly. Morticia is often shown to be indulgent of Gomez's antics, but also feels the need to rein him in when necessary.\n\nMorticia is also a devoted mother to her children, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Pubert. She is often shown to be patient and understanding, but also has high expectations for her children's behavior. Morticia's relationships with her children are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the intricate dynamics of the Addams Family.\n\n**Family tree**\n\nThe Addams Family tree is a complex and intricate network of relationships. Morticia is the wife of Gomez Addams and the mother of Wednesday, Pugsley, and Pubert Addams. Her mother is Hester Frump, and her sister is Ophelia Frump. Grandmama Addams, who is actually Morticia's mother, not Gomez's, is a significant character in the series.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Addams Family\n* Gomez Addams\n* Wednesday Addams\n* Pugsley Addams\n* Pubert Addams\n* Grandmama Addams\n* Uncle Fester\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official Addams Family website\n* Charles Addams' cartoons and illustrations\n* Addams Family TV series and movies", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Morticia_Addams\" following this outline:\n\n\nCartoons\n\"The real head of the family and the critical and moving force behind it Low-voiced, incisive and subtle; smiles are rare This ruined beauty has a romantic side, too, and is given to low-keyed rhapsodies about her garden of deadly nightshade, henbane and dwarf's hair Generally indulgent  [of] the often sinister activities of the children, but feels that Uncle Fester has to be held in check Her costume is always the same—the form-fitting black gown, tattered or cut to ribbons at the elbows and feet Occasionally, she will wear a shawl Her voice is never raised, but has great range Contemptuous and original and with a fierce family loyalty She never uses a cliché except to be funny She is a thoughtful hostess in her way and, if a guest needs anything, he is advised to scream for it The children are instructed to observe the amenities and always kick Daddy good night.\"\n\n\nBackground\nMorticia is the wife of Gomez Addams and mother of Wednesday, Pugsley and Pubert Addams The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for The New Yorker magazine in the 1930s In the cartoons, none of the family members had names When the characters were adapted to the 1964 television series, Charles Addams' selection of her name was inspired by \"mortician\" Morticia's maiden name is \"Frump\" and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by Carolyn Jones in the original TV series) In the television series, her mother is Hester Frump (played by Margaret Hamilton) Her mother-in-law is Grandmama Addams In the 1990s Addams Family films, familial relationships are changed for the characters of Grandmama and Fester Grandmama is actually Morticia's mother, not Gomez's, while Fester is Gomez's brother, not Morticia's uncle.\n\n\nIn other media\nMorticia was portrayed by Carolyn Jones in the TV series, and Halloween with the New Addams Family TV movie  According to the 60s TV series, Morticia is descended from Salem, Massachusetts (\"The Addams Family Tree\", episode 5, season 1)  In the season II 2-parter episodes, Morticia's Romance (Parts I & II), Morticia first met Gomez when she (then 22 years old) and her elder sister, Ophelia, were brought to the Addams' Mansion by their mother, Mrs Esther Frump, a long-time close friend of Gomez's mother, from their time together at \"Swamp Town High\", both of whom wished for the then around 22 year old Gomez and Ophelia to marry Before this episode, however, different allusions as to how Morticia and Gomez first met and fell in love are made; in Green-Eyed Gomez, it's mentioned that Gomez first fell in love with Morticia when he first saw her riding \"sidesaddle on a buffalo\" and she, likewise, when he carved her initials on his leg; in Morticia the Matchmaker, Grandmama mentions that her \"Love Dust\" (which she uses multiple doses on Morticia's cousin, Melancholia) was used to initially bring Morticia and Gomez together  \n\n\nRelationships\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The family's history dates back to the early 20th century, when their Armenian immigrant ancestors arrived in the United States. Over time, the family has gained widespread recognition and fame through various television shows, social media, and business ventures.\n\n## Family Background\n\nThe Kardashian family's paternal line can be traced back to Armenia, where their ancestors lived in the towns of Karakale and Ardahan. The family's great-grandparents, who were Armenians, emigrated from the Ottoman Empire to the United States in the early 20th century. They settled in the United States before the Armenian genocide began in 1915. Robert Kardashian Sr., the patriarch of the family, was born in 1944 to Armenian immigrant parents Helen and Arthur Kardashian.\n\n## Early Life and Career\n\nRobert Kardashian Sr. grew up in Los Angeles, California, and attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He graduated from law school and established a successful law practice in Los Angeles. In 1978, he married Kris Houghton, a marriage that would produce four children: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob.\n\nThe family's rise to fame began in the early 2000s, when their daughter Kourtney, a fashion designer, and Kim, a stylist, appeared on the reality television show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" The show, which premiered in 2007, followed the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family as they navigated their careers, relationships, and personal struggles.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe Kardashian family has been both praised and criticized for their media presence and entrepreneurial ventures. Some have credited the family with helping to establish the concept of \"famous for being famous,\" where individuals gain fame without necessarily possessing any notable skills or talents. Others have criticized the family for their perceived lack of authenticity and their emphasis on material wealth and superficiality.\n\nIn 2020, Forbes released an investigation into Kylie Jenner's finances, alleging that she had misrepresented her billionaire status. The article accused Kylie of using \"white lies, omissions, and outright fabrications\" to exaggerate her wealth and influence. The article also questioned the family's business practices and their reliance on social media and celebrity culture.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Kardashian family, they have undoubtedly had a significant impact on popular culture. They have been credited with popularizing the concept of \"famous for being famous\" and have helped to establish the reality television genre as a major force in popular culture.\n\nThe family has also been credited with revolutionizing the way people consume and interact with media. They have been at the forefront of social media and have used their platforms to promote their brand, products, and personal lives.\n\n## Family Trees\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner family tree is complex and has undergone numerous changes over the years. The family has expanded through marriages, births, and adoptions, resulting in a large and diverse family unit.\n\nThe family tree includes:\n\n* Robert Kardashian Sr. and his wife Kris Houghton, who had four children: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob.\n* Kourtney married Scott Disick and had three children: Mason, Penelope, and Reign.\n* Kim married Damon Thomas and had a daughter, North. She then married Kanye West and had four children: Saint, Chicago, Psalm, and a stillborn child.\n* Khloé married Lamar Odom and had a daughter, True.\n* Rob married Blac Chyna and had a daughter, Dream.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Keeping Up with the Kardashians\n* Kardashian-Jenner family\n* Social media\n* Reality television\n* Entrepreneurship\n* Armenian culture", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kardashian_family\" following this outline:\n\n\nFamily background\nRobert Kardashian Sr was the son of Helen and Arthur Kardashian All four of his grandparents were Armenian who emigrated from the Ottoman Empire to the United States of America in the early 20th century, originating from the towns of Karakale and Ardahan in modern-day Turkey The family left the Ottoman Empire before the Armenian genocide began in 1915 [10]\n\n\nReception\nThe family and media give Kim the credit for helping them start their careers The family has been criticized as being famous for being famous [8] [11] In late May 2020, Forbes released an investigation into Kylie's finances, alleging she misrepresented her billionaire status Writers Chase Peterson-Withorn and Madeline Berg stated, \"...white lies, omissions and outright fabrications are to be expected from the family that perfected—then monetized—the concept of 'famous for being famous.'\" [12] Even with the family's mainstay show Keeping up with the Kardashians, some have said the family has \"no real skills beyond 'being famous for being famous.'\" [13] Vogue stated the Kardashians have \"...proved that although they were 'famous for being famous' in the 2000s, in the 2010s they became a cultural force to be reckoned with.\" [8] They were given keys to Beverly Hills on September 2, 2010, intentionally arranged to match the area's zip code of 90210 [14] The family are often criticized for blackfishing and cultural appropriation of African-American culture [15] [16]\n\n\nFamily trees\nKardashian-Jenner family tree\n\n\nKardashian family tree\nSources for family trees: [6] [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nKardashian–Jenner family tree\nSources for family trees: [6] [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia", "content": "\nBackground\nA NATO-facilitated ceasefire between the KLA and Yugoslav forces was signed on 15 October 1998, but both sides broke it two months later and fighting resumed UN Security Council resolution 1160, resolution 1199 and resolution 1203 had been disregarded When the killing of 45 Kosovar Albanians in the Račak massacre was reported in January 1999, NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force to forcibly restrain the two sides [50] Yugoslavia refused to sign the Rambouillet Accords, which among other things called for 30,000 NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory; immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law; and the right to use local roads, ports, railways, and airports without payment and requisition public facilities for its use free of cost [51] [33] NATO then prepared to install the peacekeepers by force, using this refusal to justify the bombings [citation needed]\n\n\nGoals\nNATO's objectives in the Kosovo conflict were stated at the North Atlantic Council meeting held at NATO headquarters in Brussels on 12 April 1999: [34]\n\n\nStrategy\nOperation Allied Force predominantly used a large-scale air campaign to destroy Yugoslav military infrastructure from high altitudes After the third day of aerial bombing, NATO had destroyed almost all of its strategic military targets in Yugoslavia Despite this, the Yugoslav army continued to function and to attack Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents inside Kosovo, mostly in the regions of Northern and Southwest Kosovo NATO bombed strategic economic and societal targets, such as bridges, military facilities, official government facilities, and factories, using long-range cruise missiles to hit heavily defended targets, such as strategic installations in Belgrade and Pristina The NATO air forces also targeted infrastructure, such as power plants (using the BLU-114/B \"Soft-Bomb\"), water-processing plants and the state-owned broadcaster The Dutch foreign minister Jozias van Aartsen said that the strikes on Yugoslavia should be such as to weaken their military capabilities and prevent further humanitarian atrocities [52]\n\n\nArguments for strategic air power\nAccording to John Keegan, the capitulation of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War marked a turning point in the history of warfare It \"proved that a war can be won by air power alone\" Diplomacy had failed before the war, and the deployment of a large NATO ground force was still weeks away when Slobodan Milošević agreed to a peace deal [55]\n\n\nArguments against strategic air power\nOn 20 March 1999, OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission monitors withdrew from Kosovo citing a \"steady deterioration in the security situation\", [67] [68] and on 23 March 1999 Richard Holbrooke returned to Brussels and announced that peace talks had failed [69] Hours before the announcement, Yugoslavia announced on national television it had declared a state of emergency citing an \"imminent threat of war .. against Yugoslavia by Nato\" and began a huge mobilisation of troops and resources [69] [70] On 23 March 1999 at 22:17 UTC the Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, announced he had directed the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Wesley Clark, to \"initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" [70] [71]\n\n\nOperation\nOn 20 March 1999, OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission monitors withdrew

mobilisation of troops and resources [69] [70] On 23 March 1999 at 22:17 UTC the Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, announced he had directed the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Wesley Clark, to \"initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" [70] [71]\n\n\nNATO operations\nThe campaign involved 1,000 aircraft operating from air bases in Italy and Germany, and the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt sailing in the Adriatic Sea During the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions [citation needed]\n\n\nNATO command organisation\nSolana directed Clark to \"initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" Clark then delegated responsibility for the conduct of Operation Allied Force to the Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe, who in turn delegated control to the Commander of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, Lieutenant-General Michael C Short, USAF [96] Operationally, the day-to-day responsibility for executing missions was delegated to the Commander of the 5th Allied Tactical Air Force [97]\n\n\nYugoslav operations\nThe Hague Tribunal ruled that over 700,000 Kosovo Albanians were forcibly displaced by Yugoslav forces into neighbouring Albania and Macedonia, with many thousands internally displaced within Kosovo [98] By April, the United Nations reported 850,000 refugees had left Kosovo [99] Another 230,000 were listed as internally displaced persons (IDPs): driven from their homes, but still inside Kosovo German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping claimed at the time that the refugee crisis was produced by a coordinated Yugoslav plan of ethnic cleansing codenamed \"Operation Horseshoe\" The existence and character of such a plan has been called into question [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107]\n\n\nAir combat\nAn important portion of the war involved combat between the Yugoslav Air Force and the opposing air forces from NATO United States Air Force F-15s and F-16s flying from Italian airforce bases attacked the defending Yugoslav fighters, mainly MiG-29s, which were in poor condition due to a lack of spare parts and maintenance [citation needed] Other NATO forces also contributed to the air war.\n\n\nAir Defence Suppression Operations\nSuppression of Enemy Air Defences or SEAD operations for NATO were principally carried out by the US Air Force, with fifty F-16CJ Block 50 Fighting Falcons, and the US Navy and Marines, with 30 EA-6B Prowlers  The F-16CJs carried AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles which would home in on and destroy any active Yugoslav radar systems, while the Prowlers provided radar jamming assistance (though they could carry HARMs as well) Additional support came in the form of Italian and German Tornado ECRs which also carried HARMs.\n\n\nNATO forces\nWhile not directly related to the hostilities, on 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland joined NATO by depositing instruments of accession in accordance with Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty at a ceremony in Independence, Missouri [140] These nations did not participate directly in hostilities.\n\n\nAviation\nA large element of the operation was the air forces of NATO, relying heavily on the US Air Force and Navy using the F-16, F-15, F-117, F-14, F/A-18, EA-6B, B-52, KC-135, KC-10, AWACS, and JSTARS from bases throughout Europe and from aircraft carriers in the region.\n\n\nSpace\nOperation Allied Force incorporated the first large-scale use of satellites as a direct method of weapon guidance The collective bombing was the first combat use of the Joint Direct Attack Munition JDAM kit, which uses an inertial-guidance and GPS-guided tail fin to increase the accuracy of conventional gravity munitions up to 95% The JDAM kits were outfitted on the B-2s The AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) had been previously used in Operation Southern Watch earlier in 1999.\n\n\nNaval\nNATO naval forces operated in the Adriatic Sea The Royal Navy sent a substantial task force that included the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, which operated Sea Harrier FA2 fighter jets The RN also deployed destroyers and frigates, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) provided support vessels, including the aviation training/primary casualty receiving ship RFA Argus It was the first time the RN used cruise missiles in combat, fired from the nuclear fleet submarine HMS Splendid.\n\n\nArmy\nNATO ground forces included a US battalion from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division The unit was deployed in March 1999 to Albania in support of the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the Tirana airfield, Apache helicopter refueling sites, established a forward-operating base to prepare for Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) strikes and offensive ground operations, and deployed a small team with an AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar system to the Albania/Kosovo border where it acquired targets for NATO air strikes Immediately after the bombing campaign, the battalion was refitted back at Tirana airfield and issued orders to move into Kosovo as the initial entry force in support of Operation Joint Guardian.\nTask Force Hawk was also deployed.\n\n\nAftermath\nHuman Rights Watch concluded \"that as few as 489 and as many as 528 Yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in Operation Allied Force\" Refugees were among the victims Between 278 and 317 of the deaths, nearly 60 percent of the total number, were in Kosovo In Serbia, 201 civilians were killed (five in Vojvodina) and eight died in Montenegro Almost two-thirds (303 to 352) of the total registered civilian deaths occurred in twelve incidents where ten or more civilian deaths were confirmed [147]\n\n\nCivilian casualties\nHuman Rights Watch concluded \"that as few as 489 and as many as 528 Yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in Operation Allied Force\" Refugees were among the victims Between 278 and 317 of the deaths, nearly 60 percent of the total number, were in Kosovo In Serbia, 201 civilians were killed (five in Vojvodina) and eight died in Montenegro Almost two-thirds (303 to 352) of the total registered civilian deaths occurred in twelve incidents where ten or more civilian deaths were confirmed [147]\n\n\nMilitary casualties\nMilitary casualties on the NATO side were limited According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities from combat operations However, on 5 May, an American AH-64 Apache crashed and exploded during a night-time mission in Albania [148] [149] The Yugoslavs claimed they shot it down, but NATO claimed it crashed due to a technical malfunction It crashed 40 miles from Tirana, [150] killing the two crewmen, Army Chief Warrant Officers David Gibbs and Kevin Reichert [151] It was one of two Apache helicopters lost in the war [152] A further three US soldiers were ambushed and taken as prisoners of war by Yugoslav special forces while riding on a Humvee on a surveillance mission along the Macedonian border with Kosovo [153] A study of the campaign reports that Yugoslav air defences may have fired up to 700 missiles at NATO aircraft, and that the B-1 bomber crews counted at least 20 surface-to-air missiles fired at them during their first 50 missions [151] Despite this, only two NATO manned aircraft (one F-16C [154] [155] [156] and one F-117A Nighthawk) [157] [158] were shot down [159] A further F-117A Nighthawk was damaged by hostile fire [123] [124] as were two A-10 Thunderbolt IIs [160] [161] One AV-8B Harrier crashed in the Adriatic Sea due to technical failure [162] NATO also lost 25 UAVs, either due to enemy action or mechanical failure [163] Yugoslavia's 3rd Army commander, Lt Gen Nebojsa Pavkovic, claimed that Yugoslav forces shot down 51 NATO aircraft, though no other source verified these numbers [164]\n\n\nDamage and economic loss\nIn April 1999, during the NATO bombing, officials in Yugoslavia said the damage from the bombing campaign cost around $100 billion up to that time [182]\n\n\nPolitical outcome\nIn early June, a Finnish-Russian mediation team headed by Martti Ahtisaari and Viktor Chernomyrdin traveled to Belgrade to meet with Milošević for talks on an agreement that would suspend air strikes [193] When NATO agreed Kosovo would be politically supervised by the United Nations, and that there would be no independence referendum for three years, the Yugoslav government agreed to withdraw its forces from Kosovo, under strong diplomatic pressure from Russia, and the bombing was suspended on 10 June [194] The Yugoslav Army and NATO signed the Kumanovo Agreement Its provisions were considerably less draconian than what was presented at Rambouillet, most notably Appendix B was removed from the agreement [195] Appendix B called for NATO forces to have free movement and to conduct military operations within the entire territory of Yugoslavia (including Serbia) The Yugoslav government had used it as a primary reason why they had not signed the Rambouillet accords, viewing it as a threat to its sovereignty [196]\n\n\nKFOR\nOn 12 June, KFOR began entering Kosovo Its mandate among other things was to deter hostilities and establish a secure environment, including public safety and civil order [213]\n\n\nAttitudes towards the campaign\nThose who were involved in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action US President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, \"The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide.\" [221] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, \"We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing .. They may have been murdered.\" [222] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of \"at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing\" [223] Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, \"they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr Milošević ordered in Kosovo .. They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed ...\" [224] In the same press conference, Clinton also said, \"NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide.\" [224] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust CNN reported, \"Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send US forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort.\" [225]\n\n\nIn favor of the campaign\nThose who were involved in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action US President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, \"The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide.\" [221] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, \"We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing ..

The bombing campaign was launched on March 24, 1999, and lasted for 78 days, ending on June 10, 1999.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe conflict in Kosovo began in the late 1990s, when tensions between the Yugoslav government and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) escalated into full-blown war. The KLA, a separatist group seeking independence for Kosovo, was fighting against the Yugoslav government's efforts to suppress the region's Albanian majority.\n\nA NATO-facilitated ceasefire between the KLA and Yugoslav forces was signed on October 15, 1998, but both sides broke it two months later, and fighting resumed. The United Nations Security Council had passed several resolutions, including 1160, 1199, and 1203, calling for an end to hostilities and a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the situation continued to deteriorate, and the killing of 45 Kosovar Albanians in the Račak massacre in January 1999 was widely reported. In response, NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force to forcibly restrain the two sides.\n\n**Goals**\n\nNATO's objectives in the Kosovo conflict were stated at the North Atlantic Council meeting held at NATO headquarters in Brussels on April 12, 1999:\n\n* To prevent further human suffering and protect civilians in Kosovo\n* To restore peace and stability in the region\n* To enforce a ceasefire and a comprehensive settlement of the conflict\n* To ensure the safe return of refugees and displaced persons\n* To support the implementation of the Rambouillet Accords\n\n**Strategy**\n\nOperation Allied Force predominantly used a large-scale air campaign to destroy Yugoslav military infrastructure from high altitudes. After the third day of aerial bombing, NATO had destroyed almost all of its strategic military targets in Yugoslavia. However, the Yugoslav army continued to function and to attack KLA insurgents inside Kosovo, mostly in the regions of Northern and Southwest Kosovo.\n\nNATO bombed strategic economic and societal targets, such as bridges, military facilities, official government facilities, and factories, using long-range cruise missiles to hit heavily defended targets, such as strategic installations in Belgrade and Pristina. The NATO air forces also targeted infrastructure, such as power plants, water-processing plants, and the state-owned broadcaster.\n\n**NATO Command Organisation**\n\nThe campaign involved 1,000 aircraft operating from air bases in Italy and Germany, and the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt sailing in the Adriatic Sea. During the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions.\n\nNATO's command organisation was led by the Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, who directed the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Wesley Clark, to initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

peacekeeping troops in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory; immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law; and the right to use local roads, ports, railways, and airports without payment and requisition public facilities for its use free of cost [51] [33] NATO then prepared to install the peacekeepers by force, using this refusal to justify the

military capabilities and prevent further humanitarian atrocities [52]\n\n\nArguments for strategic air power\nAccording to John Keegan, the capitulation of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War marked a turning point in the history of warfare It \"proved that a war can be won by air power alone\" Diplomacy had failed before the war, and the deployment of a large NATO ground force was still weeks away when Slobodan Milošević agreed to a peace deal [55]\n\n\nArguments against strategic air power\nOn 20 March 1999, OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission monitors withdrew from Kosovo citing a \"steady

hostile fire [123] [124] as were two A-10 Thunderbolt IIs [160] [161] One AV-8B Harrier crashed in the Adriatic Sea due to technical failure [162] NATO also lost 25 UAVs, either due to enemy action or mechanical failure [163] Yugoslavia's 3rd Army commander, Lt Gen Nebojsa Pavkovic, claimed that Yugoslav forces shot down 51 NATO aircraft, though no other source verified these numbers [164]\n\n\nDamage and economic loss\nIn April 1999, during the NATO bombing, officials in Yugoslavia said the damage from the bombing campaign cost around $100 billion up to that time [182]\n\n\nPolitical outcome\nIn early June, a Finnish-Russian mediation team headed by Martti Ahtisaari and Viktor Chernomyrdin traveled to Belgrade to meet with Milošević for talks on an agreement that would suspend air strikes [193] When NATO agreed Kosovo would be politically supervised by the United Nations, and that there would be no independence referendum for three years, the Yugoslav government agreed to withdraw its forces from Kosovo, under strong diplomatic pressure from Russia, and the bombing was suspended on 10 June [194] The Yugoslav Army and NATO signed the Kumanovo Agreement Its provisions were considerably less draconian than what was presented at Rambouillet, most notably Appendix B was removed from the agreement [195] Appendix B called for NATO forces to have free movement and to conduct military operations within the entire territory of Yugoslavia (including Serbia) The Yugoslav government had used it as a primary reason why they had not signed the Rambouillet accords, viewing it as a threat to its sovereignty [196]\n\n\nKFOR\nOn 12 June, KFOR began entering Kosovo Its mandate among other things was to deter hostilities and establish a secure environment, including public safety and civil order [213]\n\n\nAttitudes towards the campaign\nThose who were involved in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action US President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, \"The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide.\" [221] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, \"We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing .. They may have been murdered.\" [222] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of \"at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing\" [223] Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, \"they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr Milošević ordered in Kosovo .. They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed ...\" [224] In the same press conference, Clinton also said, \"NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide.\" [224] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust CNN reported, \"Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send US forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort.\" [225]\n\n\nIn favor of the campaign\nThose who were involved in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action US President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, \"The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide.\" [221] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, \"We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing ..

Wilson had a happy childhood and finds he has a natural affinity for birds He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem [17] In his teens, however, encounters with racism

Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment [20] [21] The tragic death of his parents does not stop Sam from being a respected community volunteer [12]\n\n\nBecoming the Falcon\nWilson is an upright and cheerful social worker who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom Steve Rogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a persona to inspire the natives in their rebellion The two create the costumed persona the Falcon and train together extensively before attacking and defeating the Exiles and the Red Skull [17] The Falcon becomes Captain America's regular partner in crime-fighting, [24] and briefly even takes on the Captain America costume and identity when Rogers is believed to have been killed [25]\n\n\n2000s\nFalcon becomes a member of the new team of Avengers assembled to fight the international menace Scorpio as a United Nations peacekeeping agency By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend his telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and \"see\" through their eyes He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the Avengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United States' Secretary of Defense, Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on the Avengers and turn over their secrets Although initially hostile to one another, Falcon convinces Gyrich to help the Avengers spy on Rusk, feeding him false information while gathering evidence to expose him They discover that Rusk is actually the Red Skull, who has launched a biological weapon attack on the United States, intending to use the ensuing panic to gain control over America's government and start a war with other countries Falcon is instrumental in defeating the Red Skull [32]\n\n\nBecoming Captain America\nWilson appears in the 2010 \"Shadowland\" storyline as Falcon, after which he becomes an operative in the new incarnation of the Heroes for Hire team, in the book of the same name [39] He later appears in the 2012 \"Avengers vs X-Men\" storyline, helping She-Hulk and several other Avengers contain the students at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning [40]\n\n\nReturn as Falcon\nUpon taking the second Patriot on as his sidekick, they travel to Chicago to deal with an outbreak of gang violence, unaware that Blackheart is posing as the city's Mayor [64]\n\n\nPowers, abilities, and equipment\nIn his earliest appearances, Wilson exhibits a close bond with his bird Redwing, which is confirmed as being a telepathic link by Professor X in Captain America #174 The Red Skull later claims that he had used the Cosmic Cube to create a \"super-normal mental link\" between Sam Wilson and Redwing [65] Falcon later recalled memories of such an experience, stating he \"Hurt like hell Being mentally fused with that falcon Able to see through his eyes\" [66]\n\n\nPowers and

Being mentally fused with that falcon Able to see through his eyes\" [66]\n\n\nUniform and flight harness\nWilson's original Falcon wing harness featured detachable jet-powered glider wings made of lightweight titanium ribbing and Mylar The wings were covered with wafer-thin solar power receptors that convert sunlight into electricity to power miniature high-speed electric turbine fans in his uniform and boots The wings detached and reattached to his uniform cybernetically The harness was destroyed in Captain America and the Falcon #2 (2004) The uniform was made of synthetic stretch fabric lined with a steel-alloy mesh [volume & issue needed]\n\n\nReception\nAs part of the 2015 All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, Captain America (Sam Wilson) investigated the disappearance of Mexican teenager Joaquin Torres after he was abducted by the Sons of the Serpent [43] Captain America discovered that Joaquin was being used in the experiments of Karl Malus who turned Joaquin into a

fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan, the character first appeared in Captain America #117 (September 1969). He is the first Black American superhero in mainstream comic books.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Falcon, whose real name is Samuel Thomas Wilson, is a social worker and community leader who becomes a superhero after being inspired by Captain America. He is known for his wingsuit, which allows him to fly, and his ability to communicate with birds. The Falcon has been a member of the Avengers and has fought against various villains, including the Red Skull and the Serpent Society.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nSamuel Thomas Wilson, known as Falcon, was the first Black American superhero in mainstream comic books. The character first appeared in Captain America #117 (September 1969).\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nSamuel Thomas Wilson was born in Harlem, New York City, to Paul Wilson, a prominent minister, and Darlene Wilson. Wilson had a happy childhood and found he had a natural affinity for birds. He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem. In his teens, however, encounters with racism leave him jaded. When he is 16, Wilson refuses to join the church, believing his deeply religious parents to be ignorant for their faith. To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight. Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSamuel Thomas Wilson was born in Harlem, New York City, to Paul Wilson, a prominent minister, and Darlene Wilson.

The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight. Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment.\n\n**Becoming the Falcon**\n\nWilson is an upright and cheerful social worker who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom. Steve Rogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a persona to inspire the natives in their rebellion. The two create the costumed persona the Falcon and train together extensively before attacking and defeating the Exiles and the Red Skull. The Falcon becomes Captain America's regular partner in crime-fighting.\n\n**2000s**\n\nFalcon becomes a member of the new team of Avengers assembled to fight the international menace Scorpio as a United Nations peacekeeping agency. By this point, Falcon had discovered that he could extend his telepathic bond with Redwing, allowing him to control other birds and \"see\" through their eyes. He uses this ability to spy on Henry Gyrich (now the Avengers' liaison with the United Nations) and discovers that the United States' Secretary of Defense, Dell Rusk, has been pressuring Gyrich to spy on the Avengers and turn over their secrets.\n\n**Becoming Captain America**\n\nWilson appears in the 2010 \"Shadowland\" storyline as Falcon, after which he becomes an operative in the new incarnation of the Heroes for Hire team, in the book of the same name. He later appears in the 2012 \"Avengers vs X-Men\" storyline, helping She-Hulk and several other Avengers contain the students at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.\n\n**Return as Falcon**\n\nUpon taking the second Patriot on as his sidekick, they travel to Chicago to deal with an outbreak of gang violence, unaware that Blackheart is posing as the city's Mayor.\n\n**Powers, Abilities, and Equipment**\n\nIn his earliest appearances, Wilson exhibits a close bond with his bird Redwing, which is confirmed as being a telepathic link by Professor X in Captain America #174. The Red Skull later claims that he had used the Cosmic Cube to create a \"super-normal mental link\" between Sam Wilson and Redwing.\n\n**Uniform and Flight Harness**\n\nWilson's original Falcon wing harness featured detachable jet-powered glider wings made of lightweight titanium ribbing and Mylar. The wings were covered with wafer-thin solar power receptors that convert sunlight into electricity to power miniature high-speed electric turbine fans in his uniform and boots. The wings detached and reattached to his uniform cybernetically. The harness was destroyed in Captain America and the Falcon #2 (2004). The uniform was made of synthetic stretch fabric lined with a steel-alloy mesh.\n\n**Reception**\n\nAs part of the 2015 All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, Captain America (Sam Wilson) investigated the disappearance of Mexican teenager Joaquin Torres after he was abducted by the Sons of the Serpent.

family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland [29] [30] His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century [30] His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home [30] Despite their families' financial constraints,

[25] [26] in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (née Walker) [27] [28] Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland [29] [30] His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century [30] His paternal great-grandmother saved the family

and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003) [32]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary school years\nHawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London He later blamed its \"progressive methods\" for his failure to learn to read while at the school [40] [33] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses [39] [41]\n\n\nUndergraduate years\nHawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, [26] in October 1959 at the age of 17 [57] For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely – he found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\" [58] [59] His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.\" [2] A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\" He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction [57] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew [60] [61] The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats [60] [62] Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge [63] [64] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary [64] [65]\n\n\nPost-graduate years\nHawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle, [69] [70] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology [71] After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression – though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point [72] His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work [73] [74] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964 [75] [76]\n\n\nCareer\nIn his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition [84] [85] In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity [86] [87] [88] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius [89]\n\n\n1966–1975\nIn his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his

[89]\n\n\n1975–1990\nHawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics The mid-to-late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television [114] [115] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work [116] In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal [117] [118] He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977 [119] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford [120] [116]\n\n\n1990–2000\nHawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang [167] In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as \"The Nature of Space and Time\" [168] In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a \"cosmic censorship conjecture\" – that there could be no \"naked singularities\" unclothed within a horizon – was correct [169]\n\n\n2000–2018\nHawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001, [178] and A Briefer History of Time, which he wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers, which appeared in 2006 [179] Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of top-down cosmology, which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state [180] Top-down cosmology posits that the present \"selects\" the past from a superposition of many possible histories In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question [181] [182]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962 The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease In October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking's shortened life expectancy and physical limitations [120] [220] Hawking later said that the engagement gave him \"something to live for\" [221] The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans [81]\n\n\nMarriages\nHawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962 The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease

that the engagement gave him \"something to live for\" [221] The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans [81]\n\n\nDisability\nHawking had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades [21]\n\n\nDisability outreach\nStarting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities [293] At the turn of the century, he and eleven other humanitarians signed the Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability, which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of disabled people [294] [295] In 1999, Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society [296]\n\n\nPlans for a trip to space\nIn late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space [301] On hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities [302] On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727–200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness [303] Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs [301] It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight [304] At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death [305]\n\n\nDeath\nHawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76 [306] [307] [308] His family stated that he \"died peacefully\" [309] [310] He was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas [311] [312] [313] [314] The Gonville and Caius College flag flew at half-mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors [315] [316] [317] A tribute was made to Hawking in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea [318]\n\n\nPersonal views\nAt Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Stephen Hawking said that \"philosophy is dead\" He believed that philosophers \"have not kept up with modern developments in science\", \"have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims\", \"their art is dead\" and that scientists \"have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\" He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which \"lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it\" [355] His view was both praised and criticised [356]\n\n\nPhilosophy is unnecessary\nAt Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Stephen Hawking said that \"philosophy is dead\" He believed that philosophers \"have not kept up with modern developments in science\", \"have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims\", \"their art is dead\" and that scientists \"have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\" He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which \"lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it\" [355] His view was both praised and criticised [356]\n\n\nFuture of humanity\nIn 2006, Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: \"In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?\", later clarifying: \"I don't know the answer That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.\" [357]\n\n\nReligion and atheism\nHawking was an atheist [366] [367] In an interview published in The Guardian, Hawking regarded \"the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail\", and the concept of an afterlife as a \"fairy story for people afraid of the dark\" [307] [138] In 2011, narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel, Hawking declared:\n\n\nPolitics\nHawking was a longstanding Labour Party supporter [371] [372] He recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, [373] called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a \"war crime\", [372] [374]  campaigned for nuclear disarmament, [371] [372] and supported stem cell research, [372] [375] universal health care, [376] and action to prevent climate change [377] In August 2014, Hawking was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue [378] Hawking believed a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) would damage the UK's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas [379] Hawking said to Theresa May, \"I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit.\" [380]  Hawking was disappointed by Brexit and warned against envy and isolationism [381]\n\n\nAppearances in popular media\nIn 1988, Hawking, Arthur C Clarke and Carl Sagan were interviewed in God, the Universe and Everything Else They discussed the Big Bang theory, God and the possibility of extraterrestrial life [391]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nHawking received numerous awards and honours Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) [6] At that time, his nomination read:\n\n\nThe Hawking Fellowship\nIn 2017, the Cambridge Union Society, in conjunction with Hawking, established the Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship The fellowship is awarded annually to an individual who has made an exceptional contribution to the STEM fields and social discourse, [416] with a particular focus on impacts affecting the younger generations Each fellow delivers a lecture on a topic of their choosing, known as the 'Hawking Lecture' [417]\n\n\nMedal for Science Communication\nHawking was a member of the advisory board of the Starmus Festival, and had a major role in acknowledging and promoting science communication The Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science [420] Recipients receive a medal bearing a portrait of Hawking by Alexei Leonov, and the other side represents an image of Leonov himself performing the first spacewalk along with an image of the \"Red Special\", the guitar of Queen musician and astrophysicist Brian May (with music being another major component of the Starmus Festival) [421]\n\n\nPublications\nCo-written with his daughter

first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely – he found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\" [58] [59] His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.\" [2] A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\" He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction [57] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew [60] [61] The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats [60] [62] Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge [63] [64] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary [64] [65]\n\n\nPost-graduate years\nHawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle, [69] [70] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology [71] After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression – though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point [72] His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work [73] [74] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964 [75] [76]\n\n\nCareer\nIn his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition [84] [85] In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity [86] [87] [88] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius [89]\n\n\n1966–1975\nIn his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his

[89]\n\n\n1975–1990\nHawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics The mid-to-late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television [114] [115] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work [116] In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal [117] [118] He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977 [119] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford [120] [116]\n\n\n1990–2000\nHawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang [167] In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as \"The Nature of Space and Time\" [168] In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a \"cosmic censorship conjecture\" – that there could be no \"naked singularities\" unclothed within a horizon – was correct [169]\n\n\n2000–2018\nHawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001, [178] and A Briefer History of Time, which he wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers, which appeared in 2006 [179] Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of top-down cosmology, which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state [180] Top-down cosmology posits that the present \"selects\" the past from a superposition of many possible histories In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question [181] [182]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962 The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease In October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking's shortened life expectancy and physical limitations [120] [220] Hawking later said that the engagement gave him \"something to live for\" [221] The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans [81]\n\n\nMarriages\nHawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962 The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease

that the engagement gave him \"something to live for\" [221] The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans [81]\n\n\nDisability\nHawking had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades [21]\n\n\nDisability outreach\nStarting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities [293] At the turn of the century, he and eleven other humanitarians signed the Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability, which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of disabled people [294] [295] In 1999, Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society [296]\n\n\nPlans for a trip to space\nIn late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space [301] On hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities [302] On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727–200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness [303] Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs [301] It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight [304] At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death [305]\n\n\nDeath\nHawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76 [306] [307] [308] His family stated that he \"died peacefully\" [309] [310] He was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas [311] [312] [313] [314] The Gonville and Caius College flag flew at half-mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors [315] [316] [317] A tribute was made to Hawking in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea [318]\n\n\nPersonal views\nAt Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Stephen Hawking said that \"philosophy is dead\" He believed that philosophers \"have not kept up with modern developments in science\", \"have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims\", \"their art is dead\" and that scientists \"have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\" He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which \"lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it\" [355] His view was both praised and criticised [356]\n\n\nPhilosophy is unnecessary\nAt Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Stephen Hawking said that \"philosophy is dead\" He believed that philosophers \"have not kept up with modern developments in science\", \"have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims\", \"their art is dead\" and that scientists \"have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\" He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which \"lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it\" [355] His view was both praised and criticised [356]\n\n\nFuture of humanity\nIn 2006, Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: \"In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?\", later clarifying: \"I don't know the answer That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.\" [357]\n\n\nReligion and atheism\nHawking was an atheist [366] [367] In an interview published in The Guardian, Hawking regarded \"the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail\", and the concept of an afterlife as a \"fairy story for people afraid of the dark\" [307] [138] In 2011, narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel, Hawking declared:\n\n\nPolitics\nHawking was a longstanding Labour Party supporter [371] [372] He recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, [373] called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a \"war crime\", [372] [374]  campaigned for nuclear disarmament, [371] [372] and supported stem cell research, [372] [375] universal health care, [376] and action to prevent climate change [377] In August 2014, Hawking was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue [378] Hawking believed a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) would damage the UK's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas [379] Hawking said to Theresa May, \"I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit.\" [380]  Hawking was disappointed by Brexit and warned against envy and isolationism [381]\n\n\nAppearances in popular media\nIn 1988, Hawking, Arthur C Clarke and Carl Sagan were interviewed in God, the Universe and Everything Else They discussed the Big Bang theory, God and the possibility of extraterrestrial life [391]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nHawking received numerous awards and honours Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) [6] At that time, his nomination read:\n\n\nThe Hawking Fellowship\nIn 2017, the Cambridge Union Society, in conjunction with Hawking, established the Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship The fellowship is awarded annually to an individual who has made an exceptional contribution to the STEM fields and social discourse, [416] with a particular focus on impacts affecting the younger generations Each fellow delivers a lecture on a topic of their choosing, known as the 'Hawking Lecture' [417]\n\n\nMedal for Science Communication\nHawking was a member of the advisory board of the Starmus Festival, and had a major role in acknowledging and promoting science communication The Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science [420] Recipients receive a medal bearing a portrait of Hawking by Alexei Leonov, and the other side represents an image of Leonov himself performing the first spacewalk along with an image of the \"Red Special\", the guitar of Queen musician and astrophysicist Brian May (with music being another major component of the Starmus Festival) [421]\n\n\nPublications\nCo-written with his daughter

{"title": "Stepan_Bandera", "content": "\nBiography\nStepan Andriyovych Bandera was born on 1 January 1909 in Staryi Uhryniv, in the region of Galicia in Austria-Hungary, to Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church priest Andriy Bandera (1882–1941) and Myroslava Głodzińska (1890–1921) Bandera had seven siblings, three sisters and four brothers [20] Bandera's younger brothers included Oleksandr, who earned a doctorate in political economy at the University of Rome, and Vasyl, who finished a degree in philosophy at the University of Lviv.\n\n\nEarly life and education\nStepan Andriyovych Bandera was born on 1 January 1909 in Staryi Uhryniv, in the region of Galicia in Austria-Hungary, to Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church priest Andriy Bandera (1882–1941) and Myroslava Głodzińska (1890–1921) Bandera had seven siblings, three sisters and four brothers [20] Bandera's younger brothers included Oleksandr, who earned a doctorate in political economy at the University of Rome, and Vasyl, who finished a degree in philosophy at the University of Lviv.\n\n\nEarly activities\nBandera associated himself with a variety of Ukrainian organizations during his time in high school, particularly Plast, Sokil, and Organization of the Upper Grades of the Ukrainian High Schools (OVKUH) [25] In 1927 Bandera joined Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO) [25] In February 1929 he joined Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) [26] Bandera was drawn into national activity by Stepan Okhrymovych  [uk], one of the leaders of the Ukrainian youth movement [23]\n\n\nOrganisation of Ukrainian Nationalists\nBandera joined OUN in 1929, and quickly climbed through the ranks, thanks to the support of Okhrymovych, becoming in 1930 the head of a section distributing OUN propaganda in Eastern Galicia [28] A year later, he became director of propaganda for the whole OUN [28] After Okhrymovych's death and the flight from Poland of his successor Ivan Habrusevych in 1931, he became the leading candidate to become head of the homeland executive [28] But due to the fact that he was in detention at the time, he was unable to assume this function, and upon his release he became deputy to Bohdan Kordiuk, who assumed this function [28] After the failure of the attack on the post office in Gródek Jagielloński  [pl], Kordiuk had to step down and Bandera took over de facto his function, which was sanctioned at a conference in Berlin on 3–6 June 1933 [28]\n\n\nWorld War II\nBefore World War II the territory of today's Ukraine was split between Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania and Czechoslovakia Prior to the 1939 invasion of Poland, German military intelligence recruited OUN members into the Bergbauernhilfe unit and smuggled Ukrainian nationalists into Poland in order to erode Polish defences by conducting a terror campaign directed at Polish farmers and Jews OUN leaders Andriy Melnyk (code name Consul I) and Bandera (code name Consul II) both served as agents of the Nazi Germany military intelligence Abwehr Second Department [34] [35] [34] Their goal was to run diversion activities after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union This information is part of the testimony that Abwehr Colonel Erwin Stolze gave on 25 December 1945 and submitted to the Nuremberg trials, with a request to be admitted as evidence [34] [36] [37] [38]\n\n\nPostwar activity\nAfter the war, Bandera and his family moved several times around West Germany, staying close to and in Munich, where Bandera organized the ZCh OUN center He used false identification documents that helped him to conceal his past relationship with the Nazis [97] On 16 April 1946, the Yaroslav Stetsko-led Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations was founded, with which Bandera also collaborated [98] The ZCh OUN quickly became the largest organisation in the approximately 110,000-strong Ukrainian diaspora in Germany, with 5,000 members [99] Part of the organisation was the SB security service, headed by Myron Matviyenko [98] The OUN-M was three times smaller The foreign representation of the UHVR (ZP UHVR), led by Mykola Lebed, operated separately from the ZCh OUN, but many of its members belonged to both organizations [98]\n\n\nDeath\nThe MGB, and from 1954, the Soviet KGB, multiple times attempted to kidnap or assassinate Bandera [107] On 15 October 1959, Bandera collapsed outside of Kreittmayrstrasse 7 in Munich and died shortly thereafter A medical examination established that the cause of his death was poisoning by cyanide gas [108] [109] On 20 October 1959, Bandera was buried in the Waldfriedhof (lit. 'woodland cemetery') in Munich [110] His wife and three children moved to Toronto, Canada [111]\n\n\nFamily\nBandera's brothers, Oleksandr and Vasyl, were arrested by the Germans and sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where they were allegedly killed by Polish inmates in 1942 [114] [verification needed]\n\n\nViews\nAccording to historian Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe, \"Bandera's worldview was shaped by numerous far-right values and concepts including ultranationalism, fascism, racism, and antisemitism; by fascination with violence; by the belief that only war could establish a Ukrainian state; and by hostility to democracy, communism, and socialism Like other young Ukrainian nationalists, he combined extremism with religion and used religion to sacralize politics and violence.\" [116] Historian Timothy Snyder described Bandera as a fascist who \"aimed to make of Ukraine a one-party fascist dictatorship without national minorities\" [54] [nb 4] Historian John-Paul Himka writes that Bandera remained true to the fascist ideology to the end [52] Ukrainian historian Andrii Portnov writes that Bandera remained a proponent of authoritarian and violent politics until his death [117]\n\n\nViews towards Poles\nMarples says that Bandera \"regarded Russia as the principal enemy of Ukraine, and showed little tolerance for the other two groups inhabiting Ukrainian ethnic territories, Poles and Jews\" [119] In late 1942, when Bandera was in a German concentration camp, his organization, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, was involved in a massacre of Poles in Volhynia In early 1944, ethnic cleansing also spread to Eastern Galicia It is estimated that more than 35,000 and up to 60,000 Poles, mostly women and children along with unarmed men, were killed during the spring and summer campaign of 1943 in Volhynia, and up to 133,000 if other regions, such as Eastern Galicia, are included [125] [126] [127]\n\n\nViews towards Jews\nBandera held the antisemitic views typical of his generation [130] [119] Speaking about Bandera and his men, political scientist Alexander John Motyl told Tablet that antisemitism was not a core part of Ukrainian nationalism in the way it was for Nazism, and the Soviet Union and Poland were considered to be the primary enemies of the OUN According to him, the attitude of the Ukrainian nationalists towards Jews depended on political circumstances, and they considered Jews to be a \"problem\" because they were \"implicated, or believed to be implicated\" in aiding the Soviets in taking Ukrainian territory, as well as not being Ukrainian [131] Norman Goda wrote that \"Historian Karel Berkhoff, among others, has shown that Bandera, his deputies, and the Nazis shared a key obsession, namely the notion that the Jews in Ukraine were behind Communism and Stalinist imperialism and must be destroyed.\" [12]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn his 2006 article discussing \"the reinterpretations of  [Bandera's] career\", historian David R Marples, who specialises in the history of this area of Eastern Europe, stated that \"the impact of Bandera lies less in his own political life and beliefs than in the events enacted in his name, or the conflicts that arose between his supporters and their enemies.\" [135] According to The Guardian, \"Post-war Soviet history propagated the image of Bandera and the UPA as exclusively fascist collaborators and xenophobes.\" [136] On the other hand, with the rise of nationalism in Ukraine, his memory there has been elevated The glorification and attempts to rehabilitate Bandera are growing trends in Ukraine [137]\n\n\nCommemoration\n\nNeither Bandera nor OUN have been used as national symbols by the current Ukrainian government Ukrainian president Zelensky has not presented Bandera or his associates as national heroes Nevertheless, the memory of Bandera can be found in Ukraine [138]\n\nHero of Ukraine award\nOn 22 January 2010, on the Day of Unity of Ukraine, the then-president of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko awarded to Bandera the title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously) for \"defending national ideas and battling for an independent Ukrainian state\" [173] [174] [175] [176] Interfax-Ukraine reported that a grandson of Bandera, also named Stepan, accepted the award that day from the Ukrainian President during the state ceremony to commemorate the Day of Unity of Ukraine at the National Opera House of Ukraine [174]\n\n\n2014 Russian intervention in Ukraine\nDuring the 2014 Crimean crisis and unrest in Ukraine, pro-Russian Ukrainians, Russians (in Russia), and some Western authors alluded to the bad influence of Bandera on Euromaidan protesters and pro-Ukrainian Unity supporters in justifying their actions [201] According to The Guardian, \"The term 'Banderite' to describe his followers gained a recent new and malign life when Russian media used it to demonise Maidan protesters in Kiev, telling people in Crimea and east Ukraine that gangs of Banderites were coming to carry out ethnic cleansing of Russians.\" [136] Russian media used this to justify Russia's actions [13] Putin welcomed the annexation of Crimea by declaring that he \"was saving them from the new Ukrainian leaders who are the ideological heirs of Bandera, Hitler's accomplice during World War II.\" [13] Pro-Russian activists claimed: \"Those people in Kyiv are Bandera-following Nazi collaborators.\" [13] Ukrainians in Russia complained of being labelled \"Banderites\", even if they were from parts of Ukraine where Bandera is negatively remembered [13] A minority of people supporting Bandera views was presented in the Euromaidan protests, but Russian propaganda exaggerated their presence and demonized all Maidan protestors [13] [202] [203] Russian media even labeled \"banderites\" those 30,000 Russians who went to protest against Russian aggression in Ukraine on the Moscow March of Peace [203]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nDuring his invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin made references to \"Banderites\" in his speeches and spoke of an inevitable confrontation with \"neo-Nazis, Banderites\" in his Victory Day speech [10] [204] Russia heavily promoted the theme of \"denazification\", and used rhetoric that was similar to Soviet era policy of equating the development of Ukrainian national identity with Nazism due to Bandera's collaboration, which has a particular resonance in Russia [205] The Washington Post reported on Russian soldiers rounding up villagers who were deemed to be \"Nazis\" or \"Banderites\" [206] Deutsche Welle reported that media in Ukraine included many eyewitness accounts of Russian soldiers pursuing Bandera supporters, and wrote that \"whoever is deemed to be a supporter faces torture or death\" [10]\n\n\nAttitudes in Ukraine towards Bandera\nA poll conducted in early May 2021 by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation together with the Razumkov Centre's sociological service showed that 32% of citizens considered Bandera's activity as a historical figure to be positive for Ukraine, as many considered his activity negative; another 21% consider Bandera's activities as positive as they are negative According to the poll, a positive attitude prevailed in the western region of Ukraine (70%); in the central region of the state, 27% of respondents consider his activity positive, 27% consider his activity negative and 27% consider his activity both positive and negative; negative attitude prevails in the southern and eastern regions of Ukraine (54% and 48% of respondents consider his activity negative for Ukraine, respectively) [207]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang":

{"title": "Israel_Defense_Forces", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe Israeli cabinet ratified the name \"Israel Defense Forces\" (Hebrew: צְבָא הַהֲגָנָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל), Tzva HaHagana LeYisra'el, literally \"the army for the defence of Israel,\" on 26 May 1948 The other main contender was Tzva Yisra'el (Hebrew: צְבָא יִשְׂרָאֵל) The name was chosen because it conveyed the idea that the army's role was defence and incorporated the name Haganah, the pre-state defensive organization upon which the new army was based [9] Among the primary opponents of the name were Minister Haim-Moshe Shapira and the Hatzohar party, both in favor of Tzva Yisra'el [9]\n\n\nHistory\nThe IDF traces its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the New Yishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914) [10] There had been several such organizations, or in part even older date, such as the \"Mahane Yehuda\" mounted guards company founded by Michael Halperin in 1891 [11] (see Ness Ziona), HaMagen (1915–17), [12] HaNoter [12] (1912–13; see Zionism: Pre-state self-defense), and the much more consequential (but falsely-claimed \"first\" such organization), Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907 Bar-Giora was transformed into Hashomer in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920 Hashomer was an elitist organization with a narrow scope and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property The Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both part of the British Army of World War I, further bolstered the Yishuv with military experience and manpower, forming the basis for later paramilitary forces [13]\n\n\nOrganization\nAll branches of the IDF answer to a single General Staff The Chief of the General Staff is the only serving officer having the rank of Lieutenant General (Rav Aluf) He reports directly to the Defense Minister and indirectly to the Prime Minister of Israel and the cabinet Chiefs of Staff are formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister's recommendation, for three years The government can vote to extend their service to four, and on rare occasions even five years The current chief of staff is Herzi Halevi [25]\n\n\nStructure\nThe IDF includes the following bodies Those whose respective heads are members of the General Staff are in bold:\n\n\nUnits\n Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.\n\n\nRanks, uniforms and insignia\n Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.\n\n\nRanks\n Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.\n\n\nUniforms\nThe Israel Defense Forces has several types of uniforms:\n\n\nInsignia\nIDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which identify their corps, specific unit, and position A pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier's corps Individual units are identified by a shoulder tag attached to the left shoulder strap The position/job of a soldier can then be identified by an aiguillette attached to the left shoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type.\n\n\nService\nThe military service is held in three different tracks:\n\n\nMilitary service routes\nThe military service is held in three different tracks:\n\n\nSpecial service routes\nThe Israeli Manpower Directorate (Hebrew: אגף משאבי אנוש) at the Israeli General Staff is the body which coordinates and assembles activities related to the control over human resources and its placement.\n\n\nRegular service\nNational military service is mandatory for all Israeli citizens over the age of 18, although Arab (but not Druze) citizens are exempted if they so please, and other exceptions may be made on religious, physical or psychological grounds (see Profile 21) The Tal law exempted ultra-Orthodox Jews from service In June 2024, Israel's Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi Jews were eligible for compulsory service, ending nearly eight decades of exemption [35] The army began drafting Haredi men the following month [36]\n\n\nPermanent service\nPermanent service is designed for soldiers who choose to continue serving in the army after their regular service, for a short or long period, and in many cases making the military their career Permanent service is based on a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.\n\n\nReserve service\nAfter personnel complete their regular service, they are either granted permanent exemption from military service or assigned a position in the reserve forces No distinction is made between the assignment of men and women to reserve service.\n\n\nNon-IDF service\nOther than the civil, i.e non-military \"National Service\" (Sherut Leumi), IDF conscripts may serve in bodies other than the IDF in several ways.\n\n\nWomen\nIsrael is one of only a few nations that conscript women or deploy them in combat roles, although in practice, women can avoid conscription through a religious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so [41] As of 2010, 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, and women could be found in 69% of all IDF positions [42]\n\n\nMinorities in the IDF\nNon-Jewish minorities tended to serve in one of several special units: the Sword Battalion, also known as Unit 300 or the Minorities Unit, until it was disbanded in 2015; [57] the Druze Reconnaissance Unit; and the Trackers Unit, composed mostly of Negev Bedouins In 1982, the IDF general staff decided to integrate the armed forces by opening up other units to minorities, while placing some Jewish conscripts in the Minorities Unit Until 1988, the Intelligence Corps and the Air Force remained closed to minorities.\n\n\nDruze and Circassians\nAlthough Israel has a majority of Jewish soldiers, all citizens including large numbers of Druze and Circassian men are subject to mandatory conscription [58] Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit called \"The Minorities' Unit\", which operated until 2015 in the form of the independent Herev Gdud (\"Sword\") battalion However, since the 1980s Druze soldiers have increasingly protested this practice, which they considered a means of segregating them and denying them access to elite units (like sayeret units) The army has increasingly admitted Druze soldiers to regular combat units and promoted them to higher ranks from which they had been previously excluded.\n\n\nBedouins and Israeli Arabs\nBy law, all Israeli citizens are subject to conscription The Defense Minister has complete discretion to grant exemption to individual citizens or classes of citizens A long-standing policy dating to Israel's early years extends an exemption to all other Israeli minorities (most notably Israeli Arabs) However, there is a long-standing government policy of encouraging Bedouins to volunteer and of offering them various inducements, and in some impoverished Bedouin communities a military career seems one of the few means of (relative) social mobility available Also, Muslims and Christians are accepted as volunteers, even if older than 18 [62]\n\n\nEthiopian Jews\nThe IDF carried out extended missions in Ethiopia and neighbouring states, whose purpose was to protect Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and to help their immigration to Israel [75] The IDF adopted policies and special activities for the absorption and integration of Ethiopian immigrant soldiers, reported to have much improved the achievements and integration of those soldiers in the army, and Israeli society in general [76] [77] Statistical research showed that the Ethiopian soldiers are esteemed as excellent soldiers and many aspire to be recruited to combat units [78]\n\n\nHaredim\nUnder a special arrangement called Torato Umanuto, Haredi men could choose to defer service while enrolled in yeshivot and many avoided conscription altogether This has given rise to tensions between the Israeli religious and secular communities In 2024, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi men were eligible for compulsory service and the army began drafting them [35] [36]\n\n\nLGBT people\nSince the early 1990s, sexual identity has presented no formal barrier in terms of soldiers' military specialization or eligibility for promotion [80] [81]\n\n\nDeaf and hard-of-hearing people\nIsrael is the only country in the world that requires deaf and hard-of-hearing people to serve in the military [84] Sign language interpreters are provided during training, and many of them serve in non-combat capacities such as mapping and office work The major language spoken by the deaf and hard-of-hearing in Israel is Israeli Sign Language (also called Shassi)–a language related to German Sign Language but not Hebrew or any other local language–though Israel and Palestine are home to numerous sign languages spoken by various populations like Bedouins' Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language.\n\n\nVegans\nAccording to a Care2 report, vegans in the IDF may refuse vaccination if they oppose animal testing [85] They are given artificial leather boots and a black fleece beret [86] Until 2014, vegan soldiers in the IDF received special allowances to buy their own food, when this policy was replaced with vegan food being provided in all bases, as well as vegan combat rations being offered to vegan combat soldiers [87]\n\n\nOverseas volunteers\nNon-immigrating foreign volunteers typically serve with the IDF in one of five ways:\n\n\nDoctrine\nIn 1992, the IDF drafted a Code of Conduct that combines international law, Israeli law, Jewish heritage and the IDF's traditional ethical code—the IDF Spirit (Hebrew: רוח צה\"ל, Ru'ah Tzahal) [88]\n\n\nIDF Code of Ethics\nIn 1992, the IDF drafted a Code of Conduct that combines international law, Israeli law, Jewish heritage and the IDF's traditional ethical code—the IDF Spirit (Hebrew: רוח צה\"ל, Ru'ah Tzahal) [88]\n\n\nTargeted killing\nTargeted killing, targeted prevention [94] [95] or assassination [96] is a tactic that has been repeatedly used by the IDF and other Israeli organisations in the course of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Iran–Israel proxy conflict or other conflicts [96]\n\n\nHannibal Directive\nThe Hannibal Directive is a controversial procedure that the IDF has used to prevent the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces It was introduced in 1986, after some abductions of IDF soldiers in Lebanon and the subsequent controversial prisoner exchanges The full text of the directive has never been published and until 2003 Israeli military censorship even forbade any discussion of the subject in the press The directive has been changed several times At one time the formulation was that \"the kidnapping must be stopped by all means, even at the price of striking and harming our own forces.\" [101]\n\n\nDahiya doctrine\nThe Dahiya doctrine [103] is a military strategy of asymmetric warfare, outlined by former IDF Chief of General Staff Gadi Eizenkot, which encompasses the use of aerial and artillery fire against civilian infrastructure used by terrorist organizations [104] and endorses the employment of \"disproportionate power\" to secure that end [105] [106] The doctrine is named after the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, where Hezbollah was headquartered during the 2006 Lebanon War, which were heavily damaged by the IDF [104]\n\n\nBudget\nDuring 1950–66, Israel spent an average of 9% of its GDP on defense Defence expenditures increased dramatically after both the 1967 and 1973 wars They reached a high of about 30% of GDP in 1975, but have since come down significantly, following the signing of peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt [107]\n\n\nEquipment and weaponry\nThe IDF possesses various foreign and domestically produced weapons and computer systems Some gear comes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the M4A1 and M16 assault rifles, the M24 SWS 7.62 mm bolt action sniper rifle, the SR-25 7.62 mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets, and the AH-1 Cobra and AH-64D Apache attack helicopters Israel has also developed its own independent weapons industry, which has developed weapons and vehicles such as the Merkava battle tank series, Nesher and Kfir fighter aircraft, and various small arms such as the Galil and Tavor assault rifles, and the Uzi submachine gun Israel has also installed a variant of the Samson RCWS, a remote controlled weapons platform, which can include machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles on a remotely operated turret, in pillboxes along the Gaza–Israel barrier intended to prevent Palestinian militants from entering its territory [112] [113]\n\n\nMilitary equipment\nThe IDF possesses various foreign and domestically produced weapons and computer systems Some gear comes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as

from entering its territory [112] [113]\n\n\nMain developments\nIsrael's military technology is  famous for its firearms, [117] [118] armoured fighting vehicles (tanks, tank-converted armoured personnel carriers (APCs), armoured bulldozers, etc.), [119] unmanned aerial vehicles, [120] and rocketry (missiles and rockets) [121] Israel also has manufactured aircraft including the Kfir (reserve), IAI Lavi (cancelled), and the IAI Phalcon Airborne early warning System, and naval systems (patrol and missile ships) Much of the IDF's electronic systems (intelligence, communication, command and control, navigation etc.) are Israeli-developed, including many systems installed on foreign platforms (esp aircraft, tanks and submarines), as are many of its precision-guided munitions Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones [122]\n\n\nField rations\nField rations, called manot krav, usually consist of canned tuna, sardines, beans, stuffed vine leaves, maize and fruit cocktail and bars of halva  Packets of fruit-flavoured drink powder are provided along with condiments like ketchup, mustard, chocolate spread and jam Around 2010, the IDF announced that certain freeze-dried MREs served in water-activated disposable heaters like goulash, turkey schwarma and meatballs would be introduced as field rations [140]\n\n\nDevelopment plans\nThe IDF is planning several technological upgrades and structural reforms for the future of its land, air, and sea branches Training has been increased, including cooperation between ground, air, and naval units [143]\n\n\nForeign military relations\nStarting on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), when Israel became a sovereign state, a strong military, commercial and political relationship was established between France and Israel, which lasted until 1969 Between 1956 and 1966, the two countries had the highest level of military collaboration [158]\n\n\nFrance\nStarting on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), when Israel became a sovereign state, a strong military, commercial and political relationship was established between France and Israel, which lasted until 1969 Between 1956 and 1966, the two countries had the highest level of military collaboration [158]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 1983, the United States and Israel established a Joint Political Military Group, which convenes twice a year Both the U.S and Israel participate in joint military planning and combined exercises and have collaborated on military research and weapons development Additionally the U.S military maintains two classified, pre-positioned War Reserve Stocks in Israel valued at $493 million [citation needed] Israel has the official distinction of being an American Major non-NATO ally.\nSince 1976, Israel had been the largest annual recipient of U.S foreign assistance In 2009, Israel received $2.55 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grants from the Department of Defense [159] All but 26% of this military aid is for the purchase of military hardware from American companies only [159]\n\n\nIndia\nIndia and Israel enjoy strong military and strategic ties [163] Israeli authorities consider Indian citizens to be the most pro-Israel people in the world [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] Apart from being Israel's second-largest economic partner in Asia, [169] India is also the largest customer of Israeli arms in the world [170] In 2006, annual military sales between India and Israel stood at US$900 million [171] Israeli defense firms had the largest exhibition at the 2009 Aero India show, during which Israel offered several state-of-the art weapons to India [172]\n\n\nGermany\nGermany developed the Dolphin submarine and supplied it to Israel Two submarines were donated by Germany [181] The military co-operation has been discreet but mutually profitable: Israeli intelligence, for example, sent captured Warsaw Pact armor to West Germany to be analyzed The results aided the German development of an anti-tank system [182] Israel also trained members of GSG 9, a German counter-terrorism and special operations unit [183] The Israeli Merkava MK IV tank uses a German V12 engine produced under license [184]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited Kingdom has supplied equipment and spare parts for Sa'ar 4.5-class missile boats and F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers, components for small-calibre artillery ammunition and air-to-surface missiles, and engines for Elbit Hermes 450 Unmanned aerial vehicles British arms sales to Israel mainly consist of light weaponry, and ammunition and components for helicopters, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and combat aircraft [187] [188]\n\n\nRussia\nOn 19 October 1999, the Defense Minister of China, General Chi Haotian, after meeting with Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass in Damascus, Syria, to discuss expanding military ties between Syria and China, then flew directly to Israel and met with Ehud Barak, the then Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Israel where they discussed military relations Among the military arrangements was a $1 billion Israeli–Russian sale of military aircraft to China, which were to be jointly produced by Russia and Israel [189]\n\n\nChina\nIsrael is the second-largest foreign supplier of arms to the People's Republic of China, only after the Russian Federation China has purchased a wide array of military hardware from Israel, including Unmanned aerial vehicles and communications satellites China has become an extensive market for Israel's military industries and arms manufacturers, and trade with Israel has allowed it to obtain \"dual-use\" technology which the United States and European Union were reluctant to provide [195] In 2010 Yair Golan, head of IDF Home Front Command visited China to strengthen military ties [196] In 2012, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz visited China for high-level talks with the Chinese defence establishment [197]\n\n\nCyprus\nAs closely neighbouring countries, Israel and Cyprus have enjoyed greatly improving diplomatic relations since 2010 During the Mount Carmel Forest Fire, Cyprus dispatched two aviation assets to assist fire-fighting operations in Israel – the first time Cypriot Government aircraft were permitted to operate from Israeli airfields in a non-civil capacity [198] Israel and Cyprus have closely cooperated in maritime activities relating to Gaza, since 2010, and have reportedly begun an extensive sharing program of regional intelligence to support mutual security concerns In May 2012, it was widely reported that the Israeli Air Force had been granted unrestricted access to the Nicosia Flight Information Region of Cyprus and that Israeli aviation assets may have operated over the island itself [199]\n\n\nGreece\nSince 2010, the Israeli and Greek air forces trained jointly in Greece, indicating a boost in ties due in large part to Israel's rift with Turkey [200] Recent purchases include 100 million euro deal between Greece and Israel for the purchase of SPICE 1000 and SPICE 2000 pound bomb kits [201] In November 2011, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece's Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base [202] [203] Similar training was held in 2012 by the IAF in cooperation with the Hellenic Air Force in the Peloponnese and parts of southern Greece in a response to the need of the IAF training of pilots in unfamiliar areas [204] [205] On March 14, 2013, the navies of Israel, Greece and the US held a two-week joint military exercise for the third year in a row The annual operation is nicknamed Noble Dina and was established in 2011 Similar to Noble Dina in 2012, the exercise in 2013 included defending offshore natural gas platforms and simulated air-to-air combat and anti-submarine warfare [206] [207] [208] In March 2017, Israel participated in the large-scale \"Iniochus 2017\" military exercise, which is organized annually by Greece, along with USA, Italy and the United Arab Emirates [209] [210]\n\n\nTurkey\nIsrael has provided extensive military assistance to Turkey Israel sold Turkey IAI Heron Unmanned aerial vehicles, and modernized Turkey's F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft at the cost of $900 million Turkey's main battle tank is the Israeli-made Sabra tank, of which Turkey has 170 Israel later upgraded them for $500 million Israel has also supplied Turkey with Israeli-made missiles, and the two nations have engaged in naval cooperation Turkey allowed Israeli pilots to practice long-range flying over mountainous terrain in Turkey's Konya firing range, while Israel trains Turkish pilots at Israel's computerized firing range at Nevatim Airbase [211] [212] Until 2009, the Turkish military was one of Israel's largest defence customers Israel defence companies have sold unmanned aerial vehicles and long-range targeting pods [213]\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nAzerbaijan and Israel have engaged in intense cooperation since 1992 [218] Israeli military have been a major provider of battlefield aviation, artillery, antitank, and anti-infantry weaponry to Azerbaijan [219] [220] In 2009, Israeli President Shimon Peres made a visit to Azerbaijan where military relations were expanded further, with the Israeli company Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd announcing it was going to build a factory in Baku [221]\n\n\nOther countries\nIsrael has also sold to or received supplies of military equipment from the Czech Republic, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, Italy, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, Hungary, Belgium, Austria, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, [225] Georgia, [226] Vietnam and Colombia, [227] among others.\n\n\nCommemoration\nYom Hazikaron, Israel's day of remembrance for fallen soldiers, is observed on the 4th day of

Forces (IDF) is the military forces of the State of Israel. It is one of the most technologically advanced and well-trained militaries in the world. The IDF was established in 1948, following the establishment of the State of Israel.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe Israeli cabinet ratified the name \"Israel Defense Forces\" (Hebrew: צְבָא הַהֲגָנָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל), Tzva HaHagana LeYisra'el, literally \"the army for the defence of Israel,\" on 26 May 1948. The other main contender was Tzva Yisra'el (Hebrew: צְבָא יִשְׂרָאֵל). The name was chosen because it conveyed the idea that the army's role was defence and incorporated the name Haganah, the pre-state defensive organization upon which the new army was based. Among the primary opponents of the name were Minister Haim-Moshe Shapira and the Hatzohar party, both in favor of Tzva Yisra'el.\n\n**History**\n\nThe IDF traces its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the New Yishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914). There had been several such organizations, or in part even older date, such as the \"Mahane Yehuda\" mounted guards company founded by Michael Halperin in 1891. (see Ness Ziona), HaMagen (1915–17), HaNoter (1912–13; see Zionism: Pre-state self-defense), and the much more consequential (but falsely-claimed \"first\" such organization), Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907. Bar-Giora was transformed into Hashomer in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with a narrow scope and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. The Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both part of the British Army of World War I, further bolstered the Yishuv with military experience and manpower, forming the basis for later paramilitary forces.\n\n**Organization**\n\nAll branches of the IDF answer to a single General Staff. The Chief of the General Staff is the only serving officer having the rank of Lieutenant General (Rav Aluf). He reports directly to the Defense Minister and indirectly to the Prime Minister of Israel and the cabinet. Chiefs of Staff are formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister's recommendation, for three years. The government can vote to extend their service to four, and on rare occasions even five years. The current chief of staff is Herzi Halevi.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe IDF includes the following bodies: Those whose respective heads are members of the General Staff are in bold.\n\n## Units\n\n## Ranks, uniforms and insignia\n\n## Uniforms\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces has several types of uniforms. Insignia IDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which identify their corps, specific unit, and position. A pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier's corps. Individual units are identified by a shoulder tag attached to the left shoulder strap. The position/job of a soldier can then be identified by an aiguillette attached to the left shoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type.\n\n## Service\n\nThe military service is held in three different tracks: Military service routes, Special service routes, and Regular service. National military service is mandatory for all Israeli citizens over the age of 18, although Arab (but not Druze) citizens are exempted if they so please, and other exceptions may be made on religious, physical or psychological grounds (see Profile 21). The Tal law exempted ultra-Orthodox Jews from service. In June 2024, Israel's Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi Jews were eligible for compulsory service, ending nearly eight decades of exemption. The army began drafting Haredi men the following month.\n\n## Permanent service\n\nPermanent service is designed for soldiers who choose to continue serving in the army after their regular service, for a short or long period, and in many cases making the military their career. Permanent service is based on a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.\n\n## Reserve service\n\nAfter personnel complete their regular service, they are either granted permanent exemption from military service or assigned a position in the reserve forces. No distinction is made between the assignment of men and women to reserve service.\n\n## Non-IDF service\n\nOther than the civil, i.e non-military \"National Service\" (Sherut Leumi), IDF conscripts may serve in bodies other than the IDF in several ways.\n\n## Women\n\nIsrael is one of only a few nations that conscript women or deploy them in combat roles, although in practice, women can avoid conscription through a religious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so. As of 2010, 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, and women could be found in 69% of all IDF positions.\n\n## Minorities in the IDF\n\nNon-Jewish minorities tended to serve in one of several special units: the Sword Battalion, also known as Unit 300 or the Minorities Unit, until it was disbanded in 2015.\n\n## Druze and Circassians\n\nAlthough Israel has a majority of Jewish soldiers, all citizens including large numbers of Druze and Circassian men are subject to mandatory conscription. Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit called \"The Minorities' Unit\", which operated until 2015 in the form of the independent Herev Gdud (\"Sword\") battalion.\n\n## Bedouins and Israeli Arabs\n\nBy law, all Israeli citizens are subject to conscription. The Defense Minister has complete discretion to grant exemption to individual citizens or classes of citizens.

Sign language interpreters are provided during training, and many of them serve in non-combat capacities such as mapping and office work.\n\n## Vegans\n\nVegans in the IDF may refuse vaccination if they oppose animal testing.

based [9] Among the primary opponents of the name were Minister Haim-Moshe Shapira and the Hatzohar party, both in favor of Tzva Yisra'el [9]\n\n\nHistory\nThe IDF traces its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the New Yishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914) [10] There had been several such organizations, or in part even older date, such as the \"Mahane Yehuda\" mounted guards company founded by Michael Halperin in 1891 [11] (see Ness Ziona), HaMagen (1915–17), [12] HaNoter [12] (1912–13; see Zionism: Pre-state self-defense), and the much more consequential (but falsely-claimed \"first\" such organization), Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907 Bar-Giora was transformed into Hashomer in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920 Hashomer was an elitist organization with a narrow scope and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property The Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both part of the British Army of World War I, further bolstered the Yishuv with military experience and manpower, forming the basis for later paramilitary forces [13]\n\n\nOrganization\nAll branches of the IDF answer to a single General Staff The Chief of the General Staff is the only serving officer having the rank of Lieutenant General (Rav Aluf) He reports directly to the Defense Minister and indirectly to the Prime Minister of Israel and the cabinet Chiefs of Staff are formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister's recommendation, for three years The government can vote to extend their service to four, and on rare occasions even five years The current chief of staff is Herzi Halevi [25]\n\n\nStructure\nThe IDF includes the following bodies Those whose respective heads are members of the General Staff are in bold:\n\n\nUnits\n Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.\n\n\nRanks, uniforms and insignia\n Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.\n\n\nRanks\n Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.\n\n\nUniforms\nThe Israel Defense Forces has several types of uniforms:\n\n\nInsignia\nIDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which identify their corps, specific unit, and position A pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier's corps Individual units are identified by a shoulder tag attached to the left shoulder strap The position/job of a soldier can then be identified by an aiguillette attached to the left shoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier's work type.\n\n\nService\nThe military service is held in three different tracks:\n\n\nMilitary service routes\nThe military service is held in three different tracks:\n\n\nSpecial service routes\nThe Israeli Manpower Directorate (Hebrew: אגף משאבי אנוש) at the Israeli General Staff is the body which coordinates and assembles activities related to the control over human resources and its placement.\n\n\nRegular service\nNational military service is mandatory for all Israeli citizens over the age of 18, although Arab (but not Druze) citizens are exempted if they so please, and other exceptions may be made on religious, physical or psychological grounds (see Profile 21) The Tal law exempted ultra-Orthodox Jews from service In June 2024, Israel's Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi Jews were eligible for compulsory service, ending nearly eight decades of exemption [35] The army began drafting Haredi men the following month [36]\n\n\nPermanent service\nPermanent service is designed for soldiers who choose to continue serving in the army after their regular service, for a short or long period, and in many cases making the military their career Permanent service is based on a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.\n\n\nReserve service\nAfter personnel complete their regular service, they are either granted permanent exemption from military service or assigned a position in the reserve forces No distinction is made between the assignment of men and women to reserve service.\n\n\nNon-IDF service\nOther than the civil, i.e non-military \"National Service\" (Sherut Leumi), IDF conscripts may serve in bodies other than the IDF in several ways.\n\n\nWomen\nIsrael is one of only a few nations that conscript women or deploy them in combat roles, although in practice, women can avoid conscription through a religious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so [41] As of 2010, 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, and women could be found in 69% of all IDF positions [42]\n\n\nMinorities in the IDF\nNon-Jewish minorities tended to serve in one of several special units: the Sword Battalion, also known as Unit 300 or the Minorities Unit, until it was disbanded in 2015; [57] the Druze Reconnaissance Unit; and the Trackers Unit, composed mostly of Negev Bedouins In 1982, the IDF general staff decided to integrate the armed forces by opening up other units to minorities, while placing some Jewish conscripts in the Minorities Unit Until 1988, the Intelligence Corps and the Air Force remained closed to minorities.\n\n\nDruze and Circassians\nAlthough Israel has a majority of Jewish soldiers, all citizens including large numbers of Druze and Circassian men are subject to mandatory conscription [58] Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit called \"The Minorities' Unit\", which operated until 2015 in the form of the independent Herev Gdud (\"Sword\") battalion However, since the 1980s Druze soldiers have increasingly protested this practice, which they considered a means of segregating them and denying them access to elite units (like sayeret units) The army has increasingly admitted Druze soldiers to regular combat units and promoted them to higher ranks from which they had been previously excluded.\n\n\nBedouins and Israeli Arabs\nBy law, all Israeli citizens are subject to conscription The Defense Minister has complete discretion to grant exemption to individual citizens or classes of citizens A long-standing policy dating to Israel's early years extends an exemption to all other Israeli minorities (most notably Israeli Arabs) However, there is a long-standing government policy of encouraging Bedouins to volunteer and of offering them various inducements, and in some impoverished Bedouin communities a military career seems one of the few means of (relative) social mobility available Also, Muslims and Christians are accepted as volunteers, even if older than 18 [62]\n\n\nEthiopian Jews\nThe IDF carried out extended missions in Ethiopia and neighbouring states, whose purpose was to protect Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and to help their immigration to Israel [75] The IDF adopted policies and special activities for the absorption and integration of Ethiopian immigrant soldiers, reported to have much improved the achievements and integration of those soldiers in the army, and Israeli society in general [76] [77] Statistical research showed that the Ethiopian soldiers are esteemed as excellent soldiers and many aspire to be recruited to combat units [78]\n\n\nHaredim\nUnder a special arrangement called Torato Umanuto, Haredi men could choose to defer service while enrolled in yeshivot and many avoided conscription altogether This has given rise to tensions between the Israeli religious and secular communities In 2024, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi men were eligible for compulsory service and the army began drafting them [35] [36]\n\n\nLGBT people\nSince the early 1990s, sexual identity has presented no formal barrier in terms of soldiers' military specialization or eligibility for promotion [80] [81]\n\n\nDeaf and hard-of-hearing people\nIsrael is the only country in the world that requires deaf and hard-of-hearing people to serve in the military [84] Sign language interpreters are provided during training, and many of them serve in non-combat capacities such as mapping and office work The major language spoken by the deaf and hard-of-hearing in Israel is Israeli Sign Language (also called Shassi)–a language related to German Sign Language but not Hebrew or any other local language–though Israel and Palestine are home to numerous sign languages spoken by various populations like Bedouins' Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language.\n\n\nVegans\nAccording to a Care2 report, vegans in the IDF may refuse vaccination if they oppose animal testing [85] They are given artificial leather boots and a black fleece beret [86] Until 2014, vegan soldiers in the IDF received special allowances to buy their own food, when this policy was replaced with vegan food being provided in all bases, as well as vegan combat rations being offered to vegan combat soldiers [87]\n\n\nOverseas volunteers\nNon-immigrating foreign volunteers typically serve with the IDF in one of five ways:\n\n\nDoctrine\nIn 1992, the IDF drafted a Code of Conduct that combines international law, Israeli law, Jewish heritage and the IDF's traditional ethical code—the IDF Spirit (Hebrew: רוח צה\"ל, Ru'ah Tzahal) [88]\n\n\nIDF Code of Ethics\nIn 1992, the IDF drafted a Code of Conduct that combines international law, Israeli law, Jewish heritage and the IDF's traditional ethical code—the IDF Spirit (Hebrew: רוח צה\"ל, Ru'ah Tzahal) [88]\n\n\nTargeted killing\nTargeted killing, targeted prevention [94] [95] or assassination [96] is a tactic that has been repeatedly used by the IDF and other Israeli organisations in the course of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Iran–Israel proxy conflict or other conflicts [96]\n\n\nHannibal Directive\nThe Hannibal Directive is a controversial procedure that the IDF has used to prevent the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces It was introduced in 1986, after some abductions of IDF soldiers in Lebanon and the subsequent controversial prisoner exchanges The full text of the directive has never been published and until 2003 Israeli military censorship even forbade any discussion of the subject in the press The directive has been changed several times At one time the formulation was that \"the kidnapping must be stopped by all means, even at the price of striking and harming our own forces.\" [101]\n\n\nDahiya doctrine\nThe Dahiya doctrine [103] is a military strategy of asymmetric warfare, outlined by former IDF Chief of General Staff Gadi Eizenkot, which encompasses the use of aerial and artillery fire against civilian infrastructure used by terrorist organizations [104] and endorses the employment of \"disproportionate power\" to secure that end [105] [106] The doctrine is named after the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, where Hezbollah was headquartered during the 2006 Lebanon War, which were heavily damaged by the IDF [104]\n\n\nBudget\nDuring 1950–66, Israel spent an average of 9% of its GDP on defense Defence expenditures increased dramatically after both the 1967 and 1973 wars They reached a high of about 30% of GDP in 1975, but have since come down significantly, following the signing of peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt [107]\n\n\nEquipment and weaponry\nThe IDF possesses various foreign and domestically produced weapons and computer systems Some gear comes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the M4A1 and M16 assault rifles, the M24 SWS 7.62 mm bolt action sniper rifle, the SR-25 7.62 mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets, and the AH-1 Cobra and AH-64D Apache attack helicopters Israel has also developed its own independent weapons industry, which has developed weapons and vehicles such as the Merkava battle tank series, Nesher and Kfir fighter aircraft, and various small arms such as the Galil and Tavor assault rifles, and the Uzi submachine gun Israel has also installed a variant of the Samson RCWS, a remote controlled weapons platform, which can include machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles on a remotely operated turret, in pillboxes along the Gaza–Israel barrier intended to prevent Palestinian militants from entering its territory [112] [113]\n\n\nMilitary equipment\nThe IDF possesses various foreign and domestically produced weapons and computer systems Some gear comes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the M4A1 and M16 assault rifles, the M24 SWS 7.62 mm bolt action sniper rifle, the SR-25

operated turret, in pillboxes along the Gaza–Israel barrier intended to prevent Palestinian militants from entering its territory [112] [113]\n\n\nMain developments\nIsrael's military technology is  famous for its firearms, [117] [118] armoured fighting vehicles (tanks, tank-converted armoured personnel carriers (APCs), armoured bulldozers, etc.), [119] unmanned aerial vehicles, [120] and rocketry (missiles and rockets) [121] Israel also has manufactured aircraft including the Kfir (reserve), IAI Lavi (cancelled), and the IAI Phalcon Airborne early warning System, and naval systems (patrol and missile ships) Much of the IDF's electronic systems (intelligence, communication, command and control, navigation etc.) are Israeli-developed, including many systems installed on foreign platforms (esp aircraft, tanks and submarines), as are many of its precision-guided munitions Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones [122]\n\n\nField rations\nField rations, called manot krav, usually consist of canned tuna, sardines, beans, stuffed vine leaves, maize and fruit cocktail and bars of halva  Packets of fruit-flavoured drink powder are provided along with condiments like ketchup, mustard, chocolate spread and jam Around 2010, the IDF announced that certain freeze-dried MREs served in water-activated disposable heaters like goulash, turkey schwarma and meatballs would be introduced as field rations [140]\n\n\nDevelopment plans\nThe IDF is planning several technological upgrades and structural reforms for the future of its land, air, and sea branches Training has been increased, including cooperation between ground, air, and naval units [143]\n\n\nForeign military relations\nStarting on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), when Israel became a sovereign state, a strong military, commercial and political relationship was established between France and Israel, which lasted until 1969 Between 1956 and 1966, the two countries had the highest level of military collaboration [158]\n\n\nFrance\nStarting on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), when Israel became a sovereign state, a strong military, commercial and political relationship was established between France and Israel, which lasted until 1969 Between 1956 and 1966, the two countries had the highest level of military collaboration [158]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn 1983, the United States and Israel established a Joint Political Military Group, which convenes twice a year Both the U.S and Israel participate in joint military planning and combined exercises and have collaborated on military research and weapons development Additionally the U.S military maintains two classified, pre-positioned War Reserve Stocks in Israel valued at $493 million [citation needed] Israel has the official distinction of being an American Major non-NATO ally.\nSince 1976, Israel had been the largest annual recipient of U.S foreign assistance In 2009, Israel received $2.55 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grants from the Department of Defense [159] All but 26% of this military aid is for the purchase of military hardware from American companies only [159]\n\n\nIndia\nIndia and Israel enjoy strong military and strategic ties [163] Israeli authorities consider Indian citizens to be the most pro-Israel people in the world [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] Apart from being Israel's second-largest economic partner in Asia, [169] India is also the largest customer of Israeli arms in the world [170] In 2006, annual military sales between India and Israel stood at US$900 million [171] Israeli defense firms had the largest exhibition at the 2009 Aero India show, during which Israel offered several state-of-the art weapons to India [172]\n\n\nGermany\nGermany developed the Dolphin submarine and supplied it to Israel Two submarines were donated by Germany [181] The military co-operation has been discreet but mutually profitable: Israeli intelligence, for example, sent captured Warsaw Pact armor to West Germany to be analyzed The results aided the German development of an anti-tank system [182] Israel also trained members of GSG 9, a German counter-terrorism and special operations unit [183] The Israeli Merkava MK IV tank uses a German V12 engine produced under license [184]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited Kingdom has supplied equipment and spare parts for Sa'ar 4.5-class missile boats and F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers, components for small-calibre artillery ammunition and air-to-surface missiles, and engines for Elbit Hermes 450 Unmanned aerial vehicles British arms sales to Israel mainly consist of light weaponry, and ammunition and components for helicopters, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and combat aircraft [187] [188]\n\n\nRussia\nOn 19 October 1999, the Defense Minister of China, General Chi Haotian, after meeting with Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass in Damascus, Syria, to discuss expanding military ties between Syria and China, then flew directly to Israel and met with Ehud Barak, the then Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Israel where they discussed military relations Among the military arrangements was a $1 billion Israeli–Russian sale of military aircraft to China, which were to be jointly produced by Russia and Israel [189]\n\n\nChina\nIsrael is the second-largest foreign supplier of arms to the People's Republic of China, only after the Russian Federation China has purchased a wide array of military hardware from Israel, including Unmanned aerial vehicles and communications satellites China has become an extensive market for Israel's military industries and arms manufacturers, and trade with Israel has allowed it to obtain \"dual-use\" technology which the United States and European Union were reluctant to provide [195] In 2010 Yair Golan, head of IDF Home Front Command visited China to strengthen military ties [196] In 2012, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz visited China for high-level talks with the Chinese defence establishment [197]\n\n\nCyprus\nAs closely neighbouring countries, Israel and Cyprus have enjoyed greatly improving diplomatic relations since 2010 During the Mount Carmel Forest Fire, Cyprus dispatched two aviation assets to assist fire-fighting operations in Israel – the first time Cypriot Government aircraft were permitted to operate from Israeli airfields in a non-civil capacity [198] Israel and Cyprus have closely cooperated in maritime activities relating to Gaza, since 2010, and have reportedly begun an extensive sharing program of regional intelligence to support mutual security concerns In May 2012, it was widely reported that the Israeli Air Force had been granted unrestricted access to the Nicosia Flight Information Region of Cyprus and that Israeli aviation assets may have operated over the island itself [199]\n\n\nGreece\nSince 2010, the Israeli and Greek air forces trained jointly in Greece, indicating a boost in ties due in large part to Israel's rift with Turkey [200] Recent purchases include 100 million euro deal between Greece and Israel for the purchase of SPICE 1000 and SPICE 2000 pound bomb kits [201] In November 2011, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece's Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base [202] [203] Similar training was held in 2012 by the IAF in cooperation with the Hellenic Air Force in the Peloponnese and parts of southern Greece in a response to the need of the IAF training of pilots in unfamiliar areas [204] [205] On March 14, 2013, the navies of Israel, Greece and the US held a two-week joint military exercise for the third year in a row The annual operation is nicknamed Noble Dina and was established in 2011 Similar to Noble Dina in 2012, the exercise in 2013 included defending offshore natural gas platforms and simulated air-to-air combat and anti-submarine warfare [206] [207] [208] In March 2017, Israel participated in the large-scale \"Iniochus 2017\" military exercise, which is organized annually by Greece, along with USA, Italy and the United Arab Emirates [209] [210]\n\n\nTurkey\nIsrael has provided extensive military assistance to Turkey Israel sold Turkey IAI Heron Unmanned aerial vehicles, and modernized Turkey's F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft at the cost of $900 million Turkey's main battle tank is the Israeli-made Sabra tank, of which Turkey has 170 Israel later upgraded them for $500 million Israel has also supplied Turkey with Israeli-made missiles, and the two nations have engaged in naval cooperation Turkey allowed Israeli pilots to practice long-range flying over mountainous terrain in Turkey's Konya firing range, while Israel trains Turkish pilots at Israel's computerized firing range at Nevatim Airbase [211] [212] Until 2009, the Turkish military was one of Israel's largest defence customers Israel defence companies have sold unmanned aerial vehicles and long-range targeting pods [213]\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nAzerbaijan and Israel have engaged in intense cooperation since 1992 [218] Israeli military have been a major provider of battlefield aviation, artillery, antitank, and anti-infantry weaponry to Azerbaijan [219] [220] In 2009, Israeli President Shimon Peres made a visit to Azerbaijan where military relations were expanded further, with the Israeli company Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd announcing it was going to build a factory in Baku [221]\n\n\nOther countries\nIsrael has also sold to or received supplies of military equipment from the Czech Republic, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, Italy, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, Hungary, Belgium, Austria, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, [225] Georgia, [226] Vietnam and Colombia, [227] among others.\n\n\nCommemoration\nYom

they divorced in 1958 [49] [50] She was killed in an auto collision in Fresno, California, in 1959 [51] Although Cooke and Dolores were divorced, [52] he paid for his ex-wife's funeral expenses [49] [48] [14]\n\n\nDeath\nCooke was shot and killed on December 11, 1964, at the Hacienda Motel at 91st and South Figueroa streets in South Central Los Angeles Answering separate reports of a shooting and a kidnapping at the motel, police found Cooke's body He had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, which was later determined to have pierced his heart [58]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe first funeral service for Cooke was held on December 18, 1964, at A R Leak Funeral Home in Chicago; 200,000 fans lined up for more than four city blocks to view his body [48] [70]\n\n\nLegacy\nCooke's contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the work of Otis Redding and James Brown [74] [75] [76] AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed.\" [77]\n\n\nPortrayals\nCooke was portrayed by Paul Mooney in The Buddy Holly Story, a 1978 American biographical film which tells the life story of rock musician Buddy Holly.\n\n\nPosthumous honors\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on November 23, 1945, in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Nilsen's early life and circumstances would shape his future actions. This article explores Nilsen's life, crimes, and subsequent imprisonment.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDennis Andrew Nilsen was born on November 23, 1945, in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was the second of three children born to Elizabeth Duthie Whyte and Olav Magnus Moksheim, a Norwegian soldier who had traveled to Scotland in 1940 as part of the Free Norwegian Forces following the German occupation of Norway. After a brief courtship, Moksheim married Elizabeth Whyte in May 1942, and the newlyweds moved into her parents' house.\n\nNilsen's childhood was marked by a close relationship with his parents, particularly his mother. His father, Olav, was a strict disciplinarian, while his mother, Elizabeth, was more nurturing. Nilsen excelled in school, displaying a flair for history and art, but shunned sports. He finished his schooling in 1961 and briefly worked in a canning factory, considering various career paths.\n\n**Army Service**\n\nIn September 1961, Nilsen informed his mother that he intended to join the army and receive training as a chef. He passed the entrance examinations and received official notification that he was to enlist for nine years' service in the Army Catering Corps at St Omer Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire. Nilsen excelled in his army duties, describing his three years of training at Aldershot as \"the happiest of my life.\"\n\n**Move to London**\n\nIn April 1973, Nilsen completed his police training and was posted to Willesden Green. As a cadet and junior constable, he performed several arrests but never had to physically subdue a member of the public. Nilsen enjoyed the work but missed the comradeship of the army. He began to drink alone in the evenings and frequent gay pubs, engaging in casual liaisons with men. These encounters were \"soul-destroying\" for Nilsen, who sought a lasting relationship.\n\n**Employment**\n\nIn April 1973, Nilsen completed his police training and was posted to Willesden Green.

of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios, Winderbaum was a fan of the series, [56]: 15:50–16:02  [12] and said several filmmakers who had met with Marvel Studios in the past had cited that series as a touchstone [57] In November 2020, Beau DeMayo was asked to present a pitch for the revival after working as a writer for Marvel Studios' live-action Disney+ miniseries Moon Knight

(2022) [58] [17]\n\n\nWriting\nBy April 2022, the Lewalds had seen premises for all 10 episodes and several completed scripts from the first season, as well as the series' bible, [67]: 1:06:17–1:06:32  which confirms that—as with the original series and the comic books—the revival's central ethos is the X-Men are allegories for people who face prejudice and discrimination [92] Eric Lewald described X-Men '97 as an extension of the original series that the Marvel Studios team had made their own, [66] while Vasquez-Eberhardt said the original series \"embraced action, soap opera and serious topics\", and the revival would do the same [2] DeMayo wanted to honor the original series while bringing it into the modern world, [56]: 19:09–19:48  hoping to retain its earnestness, emotional sincerity, and focus on found family while updating the social commentary to reflect contemporary society [93] The new series explores whether Professor Charles Xavier's dream of mutant/human co-existence and his focus on empathy are still relevant to modern audiences, [27] [94] with DeMayo feeling that issues of social acceptance had become more complicated since the 1990s

[118]: 30:52  The 2D animation style of the original series was retained, but \"slightly modernized\" to improve the quality and reflect advances in animation since the 1990s [99] [66] Castorena's pitch for the job of supervising director was to make the series \"fresh, but familiar\", [12] and he said it needed to be \"the show we remember, but it has to be in 4K\" [99] Houston advised the animation team on how the original series was made, [12] and the storyboard artists reviewed the original to inform their composition, editing, and cinematography decisions Winderbaum said there was a \"code of ethics\" they followed to align with the restrictions of the 1990s animation, but they occasionally broke this for dramatic effect such as during key action sequences [99] A VHS-inspired effect was applied to the animation to make it appear more like 1990s television [12] [99] 3D animation was used to lay out scenes and create more complicated vehicles and ships, but the animation team drew over this in 2D to maintain the series' art style [119] The opening title sequence of The Animated Series was recreated with updated animation for the revival Houston worked with episodic directors Conley and Yonemura to recreate the title sequence based on Houston's original storyboards [120]\n\n\nMusic\nOne of Feige's stipulations for reviving X-Men: The Animated Series was ensuring Marvel Studios was able to use that series' theme song, [74] which was composed by Ron Wasserman Wasserman composed the theme while under contract with producer Haim Saban, giving legal ownership of the song to Saban [124] Following legal battles over the use of the theme, Marvel Studios paid a large sum to secure the rights to it in 2022 [124] [125] This was done on the condition that it be re-recorded for future projects and credited to the original series' music executives, Saban and Shuki Levy [124] Wasserman was set to meet with Marvel about his involvement in the revival by early 2022, [67]: 1:03:07–1:03:27  but John Andrew Grush and Taylor Newton Stewart—known professionally as the Newton Brothers—were announced to be the composers for X-Men '97 that July

as a touchstone [57] In November 2020, Beau DeMayo was asked to present a pitch for the revival after working as a writer for Marvel Studios' live-action Disney+ miniseries Moon Knight (2022) [58] [17]\n\n\nDevelopment\nLarry Houston, the producer and director of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997), said in June 2019 that he and that series' creative team were discussing a potential revival with Disney They wanted to continue the story from where the original series ended [55] Disney subsidiary Marvel Studios was developing their first animated series, What If...?, and executives began discussing what their next animated project could be The first idea considered was a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series, which was suggested by Brad Winderbaum The head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios, Winderbaum was a fan of the series, [56]: 15:50–16:02  [12] and said several filmmakers who had met with Marvel Studios in the past had cited that series as a touchstone [57] In November 2020, Beau DeMayo was asked to present a pitch for the revival after working as a writer for Marvel Studios' live-action Disney+ miniseries Moon Knight (2022) [58] [17]\n\n\nWriting\nBy April 2022, the Lewalds had seen premises for all 10 episodes and several completed scripts from the first season, as well as the series' bible, [67]: 1:06:17–1:06:32  which confirms that—as with the original series and the comic books—the revival's central ethos is the X-Men are allegories for people who face prejudice and discrimination [92] Eric Lewald described X-Men '97 as an extension of the original series that the Marvel Studios team had made their own, [66] while Vasquez-Eberhardt said the original series \"embraced action, soap opera and serious topics\", and the revival would do the same [2] DeMayo wanted to honor the original series while bringing it into the modern world, [56]: 19:09–19:48  hoping to retain its earnestness, emotional sincerity, and focus on found family while updating the social commentary to reflect contemporary society [93] The new series explores whether Professor Charles Xavier's dream of mutant/human co-existence and his focus on empathy are still relevant to modern audiences, [27] [94] with DeMayo feeling that issues of social acceptance had become more complicated since the 1990s [27]\n\n\nCasting and voice recording\nWith the revival's announcement, several voice actors were revealed to be returning from the original series: Cal Dodd (Logan / Wolverine), Lenore Zann (Rogue), George Buza (Henry \"Hank\" McCoy / Beast), Catherine Disher (Jean Grey), Chris Potter (Remy LeBeau / Gambit), Alison Sealy-Smith (Ororo Munroe / Storm), Adrian Hough (Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler), Christopher Britton (Nathaniel Essex / Mister Sinister), and Alyson Court (Jubilation Lee / Jubilee) [18] [57] Lawrence Bayne (Nathan Summers / Cable) and Ron Rubin (Morph) also returned Dodd, Zann, Buza, Sealy-Smith, Hough, and Britton all reprised their roles from the original series, while the others voice new roles: Disher voices Dr Valerie Cooper, Potter voices Nathan Summers / Cable, Court voices Abscissa, Bayne voices Carl Denti / X-Cutioner, and Rubin voices President Robert Edward Kelly [27]\n\n\nAnimation and design\nAnimation was provided by Studio Mir [117] and Tiger Animation [118]: 30:52  The 2D animation style of the original series was retained, but \"slightly modernized\" to improve the quality and reflect advances in animation since the 1990s [99] [66] Castorena's pitch for the job of supervising director was to make the series \"fresh, but familiar\", [12] and he said it needed to be \"the show we remember, but it has to be in 4K\" [99] Houston advised the animation team on how the original series was made, [12] and the storyboard artists reviewed the original to inform their composition, editing, and cinematography decisions Winderbaum said there was a \"code of ethics\" they followed to align with the restrictions of the 1990s animation, but they occasionally broke this for dramatic effect such as during key action sequences [99] A VHS-inspired effect was applied to the animation to make it appear more like 1990s television [12] [99] 3D animation was used to lay out scenes and create more complicated vehicles and ships, but the animation team drew over this in 2D to maintain the series' art style [119] The opening title sequence of The Animated Series was recreated with updated animation for the revival Houston worked with episodic directors Conley and Yonemura to recreate the title sequence based on Houston's original storyboards [120]\n\n\nMusic\nOne of Feige's stipulations for reviving X-Men: The Animated Series was ensuring Marvel Studios was able to use that series' theme song, [74] which was composed by Ron Wasserman Wasserman composed the theme while under contract with producer Haim Saban, giving legal ownership of the song to Saban [124] Following legal battles over the use of the theme, Marvel Studios paid a large sum to secure the rights to it in 2022 [124] [125] This was done on the condition that it be re-recorded for future projects and credited to the original series' music executives, Saban and Shuki Levy [124] Wasserman was set to meet with Marvel about his involvement in the revival by early 2022, [67]: 1:03:07–1:03:27  but John Andrew Grush and Taylor Newton Stewart—known professionally as the Newton Brothers—were announced to be the composers for X-Men '97 that July [77]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe series was discussed during Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, where animatics were shown [42] Completed animation from the series was shown a year later at the 2023 San Diego Comic-Con, where Hasbro's Marvel Legends figures for the series were also revealed [95] In December 2023, Marvel Comics announced a four-issue comic book prequel series, also titled X-Men '97,

{"title": "Tonga", "content": "\nEtymology\nIn many Polynesian languages, including Tongan, the word tonga (Tongan:  [ˈtoŋa]), [11] [12] [13] comes from fakatonga, which means 'southwards', and the archipelago is so named because it is the southernmost group among the island groups of western Polynesia [14] The word tonga is cognate to the Hawaiian word kona meaning 'leeward', which is the origin of the name for the Kona District in Hawaiʻi [15]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to Tongan mythology, the demigod Maui drew up a group of islands from the ocean, first appearing Tongatapu, the Ha'apai Islands and Vava'u, integrating into what became modern-day Tonga [17]\n\n\nPolitics\nTonga is a constitutional monarchy It is the only extant indigenous monarchy in the Pacific islands (see also Hawaiʻi) Reverence for the monarch replaces that held in earlier centuries for the sacred paramount chief, the Tuʻi Tonga Criticism of the monarch is held to be contrary to Tongan culture and etiquette Tonga provides for its citizens a free and mandatory education for all, secondary education with only nominal fees, and foreign-funded scholarships for postsecondary education.\n\n\nPolitical culture\nKing Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV and his government made some problematic economic decisions and were accused by democracy activists, including former prime minister ʻAkilisi Pōhiva, of wasting millions of dollars on unwise investments The problems have mostly been driven by attempts to increase national revenue through a variety of schemes – considering making Tonga a nuclear waste disposal site (an idea floated in the mid 1990s by the current crown prince), [36] and selling Tongan Protected Persons Passports (which eventually forced Tonga to naturalise the purchasers, sparking ethnicity-based concerns within Tonga) [37]\n\n\nForeign relations\nTonga's foreign policy as of January 2009 [update] was described by Matangi Tonga as \"Look East\" – specifically, as establishing closer diplomatic and economic relations with Asia (which actually lies to the north-west of the Pacific kingdom) As of 2021, China has attained great influence in Tonga, financing infrastructure projects, including a new royal palace and holding two thirds of the country's foreign debt [49]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Tongan government supported the American \"coalition of the willing\" action in Iraq and deployed more than 40 soldiers (as part of an American force) in late 2004 The contingent returned home on 17 December 2004 [54] In 2007, a second contingent went to Iraq, and two more were sent during 2008 as part of continued support for the coalition Tongan involvement concluded at the end of 2008 with no reported loss of life.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nTonga is subdivided into five administrative divisions: ʻEua, Haʻapai, Niuas, Tongatapu, and Vavaʻu [56] [57]\n\n\nGeography\nLocated in Oceania, Tonga is an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, directly south of Samoa and about two-thirds of the way from Hawai'i to New Zealand Its 171 islands, 45 of them inhabited, [1] are divided into three main groups – Vava'u, Ha'apai, and Tongatapu – and cover an 800-kilometre (500-mile)-long north–south line.\n\n\nClimate\nTonga has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with a distinct warm period (December–April), during which the temperatures rise above 32 °C (89.6 °F), and a cooler period (May–November), with temperatures rarely rising above 27 °C (80.6 °F) The temperature and rainfall range from 23 °C (73.4 °F) and 1,700 mm (66.9 in) on Tongatapu in the south to 27 °C (80.6 °F) and 2,970 mm (116.9 in) on the more northerly islands closer to the Equator.\n\n\nEcology\nTonga contains the Tongan tropical moist forests terrestrial ecoregion [62]\n\n\nEconomy\nTonga's economy is characterised by a large nonmonetary sector and a heavy dependence on remittances from the half of the country's population who live abroad (chiefly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States) The royal family and the nobles dominate and largely own the monetary sector of the economy – particularly the telecommunications and satellite services Tonga was named the sixth-most corrupt country in the world by Forbes magazine in 2008 [65]\n\n\nAgriculture\nIn Tonga, agriculture and forestry (together with fisheries) provide the majority of employment,

living patterns have blended, village life and kinship ties remain influential throughout the country Despite emigration, Tonga grew in population from about 32,000 in the 1930s to more than 90,000 by 1976 [82]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAccording to the government portal, Tongans, Polynesian by ethnicity with a mixture of Melanesian, represent more than 98% of the inhabitants About 1.5% are mixed Tongans and the rest are European (the majority are British), mixed European, and other Pacific Islanders In 2001, about 3,000 to 4,000 Chinese lived there, comprising 3 to 4% of the total Tongan population

agricultural schools Most levels of higher education are pursued overseas.\n\n\nEmigration\nContemporary Tongans often have strong ties to overseas lands Many Tongans have emigrated to Australia, New Zealand, or the United States to seek employment and a higher standard of living.\n\n\nCulture\nHumans have lived in Tonga for nearly 3,000 years since settlement in late Lapita times Before the arrival of European explorers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Tongans had frequent contacts with their nearest Oceanic neighbours, Fiji and Niue In the 19th century, with the arrival of Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed, especially in religion As of 2013 [update], almost 98% of residents profess Christianity The people discarded some old beliefs and habits and adopted others.\n\n\nFahu\nFahu is a form of social organization practiced by the people of Tonga, built upon a relationship between a person and their father’s sister and paternal cousins There are a few key superiorities in the social structure of fahu: [102]\n\n\nSocio-environmental impact of fahu\nSimilar social structures to fahu have been cited as significantly beneficial for human adaptation to environmental threats, especially those situated in hurricane-prone regions such as Tonga [103] The benefit stems from the fahu's ability to provide a network and capacity to allow for relocation or people and resources during environmental events, such as hurricanes or droughts.\n\n\nSport\nRugby union is the national sport, [104] and the national team (ʻIkale Tahi, or Sea Eagles) has performed quite well on the international stage Tonga has competed in six Rugby World Cups since 1987 The 2007 and 2011 Rugby World Cups were Tonga's most successful to date, both winning two out of

about \"Tonga\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nIn many Polynesian languages, including Tongan, the word tonga (Tongan:  [ˈtoŋa]), [11] [12] [13] comes from fakatonga, which means 'southwards', and the archipelago is so named because it is the southernmost group among the island groups of western Polynesia [14] The word tonga is cognate to the Hawaiian word kona meaning 'leeward', which is the origin of the name for the Kona District in Hawaiʻi [15]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to Tongan mythology, the demigod Maui drew up a group of islands from the ocean, first appearing Tongatapu, the Ha'apai Islands and Vava'u, integrating into what became modern-day Tonga [17]\n\n\nPolitics\nTonga is a constitutional monarchy It is the only extant indigenous monarchy in the Pacific islands (see also Hawaiʻi) Reverence for the monarch replaces that held in earlier centuries for the sacred paramount chief, the Tuʻi Tonga Criticism of the monarch is held to be contrary to Tongan culture and etiquette Tonga provides for its citizens a free and mandatory education for all, secondary education with only nominal fees, and foreign-funded scholarships for postsecondary education.\n\n\nPolitical culture\nKing Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV and his government made some problematic economic decisions and were accused by democracy activists, including former prime minister ʻAkilisi Pōhiva, of wasting millions of dollars on unwise investments The problems have mostly been driven by attempts to increase national revenue through a variety of schemes – considering making Tonga a nuclear waste disposal site (an idea floated in the mid 1990s by the current crown prince), [36] and selling Tongan Protected Persons Passports (which eventually forced Tonga to naturalise the purchasers, sparking ethnicity-based concerns within Tonga) [37]\n\n\nForeign relations\nTonga's foreign policy as of January 2009 [update] was described by Matangi Tonga as \"Look East\" – specifically, as establishing closer diplomatic and economic relations with Asia (which actually lies to the north-west of the Pacific kingdom) As of 2021, China has attained great influence in Tonga, financing infrastructure projects, including a new royal palace and holding two thirds of the country's foreign debt [49]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Tongan government supported the American \"coalition of the willing\" action in Iraq and deployed more than 40 soldiers (as part of an American force) in late 2004 The contingent returned home on 17 December 2004 [54] In 2007, a second contingent went to Iraq, and two more were sent during 2008 as part of continued support for the coalition Tongan involvement concluded at the end of 2008 with no reported loss of life.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nTonga is

seasonally flooded, a sign advising against entering the caves during the rainy season (July to November) is posted at the entrance [14]\n\n\nTeam members\nThere were 12 children and one adult trapped in the cave, as follows: [20] [24]\n\n\nSearch\nBritish caver Vernon Unsworth, who lives in Chiang Rai and has knowledge of the cave complex, was scheduled to make a solo venture into the cave on 24 June when he received a call about the missing boys [36] Unsworth advised the Thai government to request assistance from the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) [36] [37] On 25 June, Thai Navy SEALs divers arrived and began searching the cave [38] A Thai Navy SEAL said the water was so murky that even with lights they could not see where they were going underwater [39] After continuous rain, which further flooded the entrance, the search had to be temporarily interrupted [40] On 27 June, three BCRC cave divers arrived with specialist equipment including HeyPhone radios, [41] followed by separate teams of open-water divers On 28 June, a United States Air Force team—reportedly United States Air Force Pararescuemen [42] from the 320th Special Tactics Squadron, the 31st Rescue Squadron, and the 353rd Special Operations Group—joined them By 29 June, an Australian Federal Police team of Specialist Response Group divers had arrived, followed by a Chinese team of divers from the Beijing Peaceland Foundation on Sunday, 1 July [37] [43] [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nPlanning and preparation\nA logistics camp was established at the cave entrance, which accommodated hundreds of volunteers and journalists in addition to the rescue workers The site was divided into several zones: restricted areas for the Thai Navy SEALs, other military personnel, and civilian rescuers; an area for the relatives to give them privacy; and areas for the press and the general public [77]\n\n\nChallenges\nThe place where the boys became stranded was about 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) [64] from the entrance and 800–1,000 metres (2,600–3,300 ft) below the top of the mountain [80] The route to their location was blocked by several flooded sections, some with strong currents and zero visibility, [81] and there were some extremely narrow parts, the smallest measuring only 38 by 72 centimetres (15 in × 28 in) [82] [83] [84] The journey through the cave to reach the boys took six hours against the current and five hours to exit with the current, [85] even for experienced divers [86]\n\n\nOptions\nAs the crisis unfolded, rescuers planned several different methods to save the team and coach The principal

to the threat of monsoon rains later in the week, which were expected to flood the cave until October.\n\n\nRecovery\nThai authorities reported that the rescued boys were able to eat rice porridge, but more complex foods would be withheld for ten days [141] The Thai Health Ministry said the boys had lost an average of 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) each, but they were in \"good condition\" [142] They were

The rescue operation was complicated by heavy rainfall, flooding, and the remote location of the cave system.\n\n## Background and Disappearance\n\nTham Luang Nang Non is a karstic cave complex beneath Doi Nang Non, a mountain range on the border between Thailand and Myanmar. The cave system is 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) long and has many deep recesses, narrow passages, and tunnels winding under hundreds of metres of limestone strata. Since part of the system is seasonally flooded, a sign advising against entering the caves during the rainy season (July to November) is posted at the entrance.\n\n## Team Members\n\nThere were 12 children and one adult trapped in the cave, as follows:\n\n* 12 boys: Chanin \"Titan\" Wiboonrungrueng, 11; Panumas \"Nin\" Sangkhachot, 10; Kamolthorn \"First\" Songserm, 12; Patcharapon \"Nick\" Nokpha, 13; Phiphat \"James\" Boonthong, 13; Jantewat \"New\" Thumata, 14; Somphob \"Pong\" Wongdee, 14; Ekarat \"Bew\" Wongsukchan, 14; Nakharin \"Mik\" Wongsukchan, 11; Thirasak \"Mark\" Sangkhachot, 12; and Orawin \"Chicken\" Wanvatthanakun, 11\n* 1 assistant coach: Ekkaphon Kanthawong\n\n## Search\n\nBritish caver Vernon Unsworth, who lives in Chiang Rai and has knowledge of the cave complex, was scheduled to make a solo venture into the cave on 24 June when he received a call about the missing boys.

To have the time to make the film, Vaughn had to opt out of directing _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, which he called \"a really tough decision\". He reasoned that if he did not do it, \"somebody else.. [would] wake up and do a fun spy movie Then I would have written a bloody screenplay that no one would want to make.\" Colin Firth joined the cast to lead the film on 29 April 2013. It was initially reported in 2013 that Leonardo DiCaprio was in talks to play a villain, although Vaughn himself later denied that he was ever considered, stating that he came as close to playing the role \"as I am to becoming the Pope\". Instead the role of the villain went to Samuel L Jackson. Jackson took the role in part because of a career-long dream to be in a James Bond movie As he felt that this was unlikely to come true, he took on the role, stating \"I felt like this was an opportunity to play a really great Bond villain\". Jackson's character has a notable lisp, which was partially inspired by the stutter he had during his childhood. In September 2013, Vaughn cast Sophie Cookson for the female lead, preferring a newcomer over more obvious candidates like Emma Watson and Bella Heathcote.

{"title": "José_Mourinho", "content": "\nEarly life, playing career and education\nMourinho was born in 1963 to a large middle-class family in Setúbal (a city in the Lisbon metropolitan area), Portugal, the son of José Manuel Mourinho Félix, who was known by the name Félix Mourinho, and his wife, Maria Júlia Carrajola dos Santos [21] [22] His father played football professionally for Belenenses and Vitória de Setúbal, earning one cap for Portugal in the course of his career His mother was a primary school teacher from an affluent background; [23] her uncle funded the construction of the Vitória de Setúbal football stadium The Carnation Revolution leading to the fall of António de Oliveira Salazar's Estado Novo regime in April 1974 also led to the family losing all but a single property in nearby Palmela [24]\n\n\nEducation\nMourinho failed in the subject of mathematics during the final year of high school, and this prevented him of finishing high school at time to enroll at the physical education college as was his wish, but later on, after finishing high school in the special examination period of September, his mother enrolled him in a private business school because there weren't vacant places for him in the physical education college and, in addition, his mother believed business school would bring him to a more successful career path [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Mourinho dropped out business school on his first day, deciding he would rather focus on sport, and chose to attend the Instituto Superior de Educação Física (ISEF) to study physical education [24] [37] After 1989, the Higher Institute of Physical Education (ISEF) became the Faculdade de Motricidade Humana (FMH), or Faculty of Human Kinetics, in English, and since then it was a part of the Technical University of Lisbon that would award a honoris causa doctorate degree to Mourinho in 2009 [38] [39] After he concluded his education in ISEF, he attended coaching courses held by the English and Scottish Football Associations [34] In this period of his life, former Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh took note of the young Portuguese's drive and attention to detail [40] Mourinho sought to redefine the role of coach in football by mixing coaching theory with motivational and psychological techniques [23]\n\n\nCoaching career\nAfter leaving his job as a physical education school teacher, [41] [42] Mourinho looked for a path into professional football management in his hometown and became youth team coach at Vitória de Setúbal in the early 1990s Later, he accepted the position of assistant manager at Estrela da Amadora, [40] then was a scout at Ovarense Then, in 1992, an opportunity arose to work as a translator for a top foreign coach: Bobby Robson had been appointed as the new manager of Lisbon club Sporting CP and needed an English-speaking local coach to work as his interpreter [30] His presentation was on 7 July, alongside president Sousa Cintra, manager Robson and Manuel Fernandes [43]\n\n\nManagerial career\nThe chance to become a top-tier manager arrived in September 2000 when Mourinho was appointed as the replacement for Benfica manager Jupp Heynckes after the fourth week of the Primeira Liga [48]\n\n\nBenfica\nThe chance to become a top-tier manager arrived in September 2000 when Mourinho was appointed as the replacement for Benfica manager Jupp Heynckes after the fourth week of the Primeira Liga [48]\n\n\nUnião de Leiria\nMourinho found a new managerial post in July 2001 with União de Leiria [56] During his time at União de Leiria, the team was on a run contesting places as high as third and fourth After a 1–1 draw against Santa Clara on 20 January 2002, Mourinho recorded eight matches unbeaten in the league (six wins, two draws) since 25 November 2001 [57] And the team was in fourth place, one point ahead of Porto, one point behind Benfica and six points behind the top of the league table [58] [59] Mourinho's successes at Leiria did not go unrecognised and he caught the attention of larger Portuguese clubs [44]\n\n\nPorto\nMourinho was then chosen by Porto to replace Octávio Machado on 23 January 2002 [60] At this time, Porto was in fifth place in the Liga (behind Sporting CP, Boavista, União de Leiria and Benfica), had been eliminated from the Taça de Portugal and was in last place in their UEFA Champions League second group stage Mourinho guided the team to third place that year after a strong 15-game run (including 11 wins) and gave the promise of \"making Porto champions next year\".\n\n\n2002–03: First league title and European treble\nIn 2003, Mourinho won his first Primeira Liga with a 27–5–2 record, 11 points clear of Benfica, the team he quit two years earlier The total of 86 points out of the possible maximum of 102 was a Portuguese record, until the 2015–16 season won by Benfica (88 points), since the rule of three points per win was introduced Mourinho also won the Taça de Portugal, beating former club Leiria in the final, and the UEFA Cup final against Celtic, both in May 2003.\n\n\n2003–04: Final season and Champions League title\nThe following season witnessed further successes: he led Porto to victory in the one-match Portuguese Super Cup, beating Leiria 1–0 They lost the UEFA Super Cup 1–0 to Milan, with Andriy Shevchenko scoring the only goal The team was dominant in the Primeira Liga and finished the season with a perfect home record, an eight-point advantage and a 27-match unbeaten run that ran from the start of the season until early April, when they lost to Gil Vicente They secured the title five weeks before the end of the season Porto lost the 2004 Taça de Portugal Final to Benfica in May 2004, but two weeks later, Mourinho won a greater prize: the UEFA Champions League, with a 3–0 win over Monaco in Germany The club had eliminated Manchester United, Lyon and Deportivo de La Coruña and their sole defeat of the competition came against Real Madrid in the group round.\n\n\nChelsea\nFollowing a Champions League tie between Chelsea and Barcelona in March 2005, Mourinho accused referee Anders Frisk and Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of breaking FIFA rules by having a meeting at half-time Mourinho said that this biased the referee and caused him to send off Chelsea striker Didier Drogba in the second half [305] Frisk stated that Rijkaard had tried to speak to him but said that he had sent him away [306] The situation intensified when Frisk began to receive death threats from angered fans, causing the referee to retire prematurely [307] UEFA referees chief Volker Roth labelled Mourinho an \"enemy of football\", [308] although UEFA distanced themselves from the comment [309] After an investigation of the incident, Mourinho was given a two-match touchline ban for his behaviour and both Chelsea and the manager were fined by UEFA, though the body confirmed that it did not hold Mourinho personally responsible for Frisk's retirement [310] [311]\n\n\n2004–06: First trophies in England\nUnder Mourinho, Chelsea built on the potential developed in the previous season By early December, they were at the top of the Premier League table and had reached the knock-out stages of the Champions League He secured his first trophy by winning the League Cup against Liverpool 3–2 (AET) in Cardiff Towards the end of the match, Mourinho was escorted from the touchline after putting his finger to his mouth in the direction of Liverpool fans, as a response to taunts directed towards him whilst Liverpool were leading, before the equalising goal.\n\n\n2006–07: Continued domestic success\nThe 2006–07 season saw growing media speculation that Mourinho would leave the club at the season's conclusion due to alleged poor relations with owner Roman Abramovich and a power struggle with sporting director Frank Arnesen and Abramovich advisor Piet de Visser Mourinho later cleared doubts regarding his future at Stamford Bridge, stating that there would only be two ways for him to leave Chelsea: if Chelsea did not offer him a new contract before the expiry of his current deal in June 2010, or if Chelsea were to sack him [77]\n\n\n2007–08: Departure\nIn the first match of the 2007–08 season, Chelsea beat Birmingham City 3–2 to set a new record of 64 consecutive home league matches without defeat Despite surpassing the record set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1981, [78] the start to the 2007–08 season was less successful than previous starts The team lost at Aston Villa and followed this with a goalless draw at home to Blackburn Rovers Their opening game in the UEFA Champions League saw them only manage a 1–1 home draw against the Norwegian team Rosenborg in front of only 24,973 (an almost half-empty stadium), which included an unimpressed owner Roman Abramovich [79]\n\n\nInter Milan\nOn 3 June 2008, during the press conference introducing him as new Inter manager, Mourinho spoke almost perfect Italian When asked about how he would see players like Frank Lampard or Michael Essien in Italian Serie A, Mourinho realised that this was a way of making him speak about Chelsea players, something he had refused to do in previous questions Consequently, he replied \"Ma io non sono pirla!\" (Milanse Italian for \"I'm not stupid!\") [316] [317]\n\n\n2008–09: First Serie A title\nIn his first season as Inter head coach, Mourinho won the Supercoppa Italiana, beating Roma on penalties, [90] and finished top of Serie A Inter were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate by Manchester United in the first knock-out round of the Champions League, and he also failed to win the Coppa Italia, losing 3–1 on aggregate to Sampdoria in the semi-finals [91] As UEFA was beginning to push the larger clubs in top leagues to play more homegrown players, Mourinho regularly played 18-year-old Italian forward Mario Balotelli and promoted academy defender Davide Santon to the first team permanently, installing an Italian contingent into a team previously composed of mostly foreign players Both teenagers played a part in the Scudetto-winning season and played enough games to earn their first senior trophy.\n\n\n2009–10: Final season in Italy and historic treble\nOn 28 July 2009, Mourinho was reported to have shown interest in taking over at Manchester United when Alex Ferguson retired He was quoted as saying, \"I would consider going to Manchester United but United have to consider if they want me to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson If they do, then of course.\" [93]\n\n\nReal Madrid\nIn a 2010–11 Champions League match at Ajax in November 2010, late in the match when Real Madrid were leading 4–0, two Real Madrid players received late second yellow cards related to time-wasting The result of this meant they were suspended for the final group match even though Madrid would come first in the group, but would benefit by entering the round of 16 without any accumulated yellow cards It was suggested after an investigation by UEFA that this was a deliberate ploy under Mourinho's instruction via two players in a substitution As a result, UEFA charged Mourinho along with the four related players with improper conduct regarding the dismissals [354] Although Mourinho denied the allegations, he was fined £33,500 and received a one-match Champions League ban [355]\n\n\n2010–11: First season in Spain\nOn 29 August 2010, Real Madrid drew 0–0 at Mallorca in Mourinho's first La Liga game as manager [112] When asked about all the missed opportunities against Levante in La Liga and Auxerre in the Champions League, Mourinho said, \"One day some poor rival is going to pay for the chances we've missed today.\" The following match at the Bernabéu ended with a 6–1 victory over Deportivo de La Coruña The following league games confirmed Mourinho's statement, defeating Málaga 4–1 and Racing Santander 6–1.\n\n\n2011–12: Record breaking La Liga title\nOn 7 December 2011, Real Madrid defeated Ajax with a 3–0 scoreline and concluded the Champions League group stage with six victories, [122] becoming the fifth team in Champions League history to accomplish the feat [123] The victory was the team's 15th consecutive win to equal a club record set 50 years earlier, in 1961 [124] On 21 April 2012, Real Madrid won 2–1 against Barcelona in El Clásico at Camp Nou, extending their lead in La Liga to seven points with four matches remaining This was the first victory for Real Madrid in La Liga against their archrivals since 2008 and the first overall at Camp Nou since 2007 Also, in this match Real Madrid broke the record for most goals scored in the championship, with 109 [125] [126] Barça manager Pep Guardiola conceded the title to Real Madrid [127]\n\n\n2012–13: Final season in Madrid\nOn 22 May 2012, Mourinho signed a new four-year contract to remain as Real Madrid manager through to 2016 [135] After losing 3–2 in Barcelona in the first leg of the 2012 Supercopa de España, Real Madrid won the return leg in Madrid 2–1 Real Madrid won the competition on the away goals rule after a tie of 4–4 on aggregate This meant Mourinho had won every domestic title available for a manager in the Spanish top division within two years He became the only coach who has won the national super cups in four European countries [136] This also made Mourinho the first manager in history to win every domestic title, the league championship, cup, super cup and league cup (if available) in four European leagues.\n\n\nReturn to Chelsea\nOn 3 June 2013, Chelsea appointed Mourinho as manager for the second time, on a four-year contract [143] Mourinho told Chelsea TV, \"In my career I've had two great passions – Inter and Chelsea – and Chelsea is more than important for me.\" \"It was very, very hard to play against Chelsea, and I did it only twice which was not so bad.\" \"Now I promise exactly the same things I promised in 2004 with this difference to add: I'm one of you.\" [144] On 10 June 2013, Mourinho was officially confirmed as Chelsea manager for the second time at a press conference held at Stamford Bridge [145]\n\n\n2013–15: Return and Third Premier League title\nMourinho's first competitive game back in charge of Chelsea ended in a 2–0 home victory against Hull City on 18 August 2013 [146] On 30 August Mourinho faced defending UEFA Champions League winners Bayern Munich in the UEFA Super Cup, which was his second as a manager [147] Despite taking the lead Chelsea lost to Bayern on penalties as Romelu Lukaku saw his decisive penalty getting saved by Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer Following the loss to Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich he said, \"They take the cup and the best team lost Even with ten men we played fantastically Pride is OK but we lost.\" [148]\n\n\n2015–16: Second departure\nOn 7 August 2015, Mourinho signed a new four-year contract with Chelsea that would have kept him at Stamford Bridge until 2019 [160] On 29 August, Mourinho reached his 100th Premier League home match at Chelsea, which ended in a 2–1 loss to Crystal Palace [161] Chelsea started the season by picking up just eleven points in their first twelve games in the Premier League They also went out of the League Cup to Stoke City on penalties on 27 October [162] [163]\n\n\nManchester United\nThe Football Heritage speech was made by Mourinho on March 16, 2018, during a press conference after his Manchester United side lost to Sevilla in the UEFA Champions League The 2–1 loss was the first time that Manchester United lost to Sevilla in European competition During his 12-minute speech, Mourinho made various remarks and criticized the management of Manchester United, implying that a club's success stems from the caliber of players they sign [357] [358] Mourinho defended his record of Champions League success in a subsequent press conference before an FA Cup tie against Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. [359]\n\n\n2016–17: Europa League title and double\nOn 27 May 2016, Mourinho signed a three-year contract with Manchester United, with an option to stay at the club until at least 2020 [165] On 7 August 2016, Mourinho won his first trophy, the FA Community Shield, beating reigning Premier League champions Leicester City 2–1 [166] Mourinho was victorious in his first Premier League game as United boss, winning 3–1 away to AFC Bournemouth on 14 August 2016 [167]\n\n\n2017–18: Premier League and FA Cup runner-up\nMourinho strengthened his side further in the summer of 2017, with the signings of Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, defender Victor Lindelöf and midfielder Nemanja Matić [177] United made a strong start to the season before a difficult winter schedule widened the gap between them and city rivals Manchester City [178]\n\n\n2018–19: Final season in Manchester\nAfter a poor start to the 2018–19 season which saw Manchester United lose two of their opening three league games for the first time in 26 years, including a 3–0 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur – the heaviest home defeat of his career – an animated Mourinho demanded \"respect\" from critical journalists and held up three fingers (one for each Premier League trophy he had won as coach), adding: \"I won more Premier Leagues alone than the other 19 managers  [in the league] together.\" [182] At his next press conference four days later, he said: \"I am the manager of the one of the greatest clubs in the world but I'm also one of the greatest managers in the world.\" [182]\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\nOn

world, at least at elite level, José Mourinho stands alone He was at the greatest coaching seminar the world has seen  [at Barcelona in the mid-90s], when the game as we know it was shaped, but he did

it for two reasons One, because we only had 10 men and two, because we beat them 3–1 at San Siro, not by parking the bus, or the boat or the airplane but by smashing them.\"\n\n\nMedia attention and controversies\nFollowing a Champions League tie between Chelsea and Barcelona in March 2005, Mourinho accused referee Anders Frisk and Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of breaking FIFA rules by having a meeting at half-time Mourinho said that this biased the referee and caused him to send off Chelsea striker Didier Drogba in the second half [305] Frisk stated that Rijkaard had tried to speak to him

have played in goal for Inter Lo Monaco stated: \"Mourinho andrebbe preso a bastonate sui denti\" (Italian for \"Mourinho should be beaten on his teeth\") Lo Monaco later clarified that he did not mean to encourage violence, but that it was just a way of saying that Mourinho should shut up When asked about Lo Monaco's statements, Mourinho replied that he did not know him, saying that he only knew other Monacos such as the principality, or Bayern Munich, known in Italy as Bayern Monaco [318] [319]\n\n\nComparison with Mancini\nOn 9 November 2008, after Inter defeated Udinese 1–0 via a late Julio Ricardo Cruz goal, [320] Mourinho had a discussion with the journalist Mario Sconcerti As the Portuguese manager had underlined on the day before that he was collecting more points during his first Serie A campaign with Inter compared to Roberto Mancini's first season, basically with the aim of defending his work, which media considered below expectations, Sconcerti invited Mourinho to avoid comparisons with the Italian manager, who could not respond directly An annoyed Mourinho replied to Sconcerti asking for honest comparisons and emphasising once again that he was doing better than Mancini [321] [322]\n\n\nWild celebration against Siena\nOn 20 December 2008, after Maicon scored the late winning goal in a difficult away match against Siena, which ended 2–1, [323] Mourinho wildly ran in front of the tiers reserved to Inter supporters to celebrate, hugging the Brazilian himself In the post-match interview, the journalist Maurizio Pistocchi showed his surprise for Mourinho's behaviour, which he considered exaggerated and possibly a lack of respect to Siena supporters [324] The Portuguese manager replied that he was used to that, recalling his iconic celebration in Old Trafford in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Manchester United in 2004, when his team eventually won [325]\n\n\nStatement about the 2006 Scudetto\nDuring the halftime of a January 2009 match against Atalanta, Mourinho was quoted as saying: \"The first Scudetto was given to you in the secretariat  [referencing the controversial 2005–06 Serie A title awarded to third-placed Inter in the aftermath of the Calciopoli scandal], the second you won it because there was no one there  [to compete against], the third  [you won it] at the last minute You are a shitty team.\" [326] [327] Although Mourinho justified himself by stating that \" [s]ometimes you need to tell lies to stimulate the players, to piss them off\", he admitted having said the statement [328]\n\n\nZeru tituli conference\nDuring a press conference on 3 March 2009, Mourinho said that Milan and Roma would end the season with no honours and alleged that Juventus had collected a lot of points thanks to referees' mistakes; he also accused Italian sport journalists of \"intellectual prostitution\" on their behalf, as they were focusing on a possible mistake regarding a penalty conceded to Inter against Roma instead of talking about the failures of Inter's rivals [329] [316] [330]\n\n\nItaly national team representatives\nMourinho once again sparked controversy in the summer with his argument with Italy national team coach Marcello Lippi Lippi predicted that Juventus would win the scudetto in the 2009–10 season, which Mourinho viewed as a disrespectful statement to Inter coming from a national team manager Lippi responded by saying that it was just a prediction [336] [337]\n\n\nIncident with Ramazzotti\nAfter Inter drew 1–1 with Atalanta on 13 December 2009, [339]

both Inter and Atalanta press offices to attend players' interviews in that spot Allegedly, Mourinho not only insulted the journalist but also grabbed him, thus causing controversy A lot of colleagues sided with Ramazzotti, defending the general right to report news without fearing to be attacked and considering the incident very serious [340] [341] [342] Subsequently, Inter president Massimo Moratti phoned Ramazzotti in order to apologise to him [343] Furthermore, the Federal Prosecutor referred Mourinho \"for having said, towards the sports journalist Andrea Ramazzotti, offensive remarks

Napoli (0–0 on 14 February), [348] [349] Mourinho defended Inter's performances, stating that he was satisfied with collecting two more points on the road to the league title, despite those results not being positive themselves In particular, the Inter manager used some sharp words regarding Walter Mazzarri and Aurelio De Laurentiis, Napoli's respective manager and president [350]\n\n\nHandcuffs gesture\nDuring the Serie A game against Sampdoria on 22 February 2010, which ended in a 0–0 draw, with two Inter players being sent off in the first half, Mourinho was disappointed by Paolo Tagliavento's refereeing At the end of the first half, the Inter manager made a handcuffs gesture towards a camera which was considered by the Italian Football Federation as violent and critical of the refereeing performance, and caused a three-game ban against Mourinho [351] Further complaining happened in the second half, when the referee denied Inter a penalty, booking Samuel Eto'o for diving instead, causing Mourinho to laugh ironically as a sign of complaint All the supporters in San Siro sided with Mourinho with a pañolada, a very unusual form of protest in Italy [352]\n\n\nParames statement\nIn February 2010, both Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri and Napoli equivalent Walter Mazzarri released some comments critical of Mourinho: the former said that it was too easy to switch from Chelsea under Roman Abramovich to Massimo Moratti at Inter; the latter stated that he had won more than Mourinho in proportion Despite Moratti's decision to order a press blackout for Inter following controversial refereeing decisions, Mourinho managed to reply to those managers through his spokesman Eladio Parames [353]\n\n\nReal Madrid\nIn a 2010–11 Champions League match at Ajax in November 2010, late in the match when Real Madrid were leading 4–0, two Real Madrid players received late second yellow cards related to time-wasting The result of this meant they were suspended for the final group match even though Madrid would come first in the group, but would benefit by entering the round of 16 without any accumulated yellow cards It was suggested after an investigation by UEFA that this was a deliberate ploy under Mourinho's instruction via two players in a substitution As a result, UEFA charged Mourinho along with the four related players with improper conduct regarding the dismissals [354] Although Mourinho denied the allegations, he was fined £33,500 and received a one-match Champions League ban [355]\n\n\nManchester United\nThe Football Heritage speech

prevented him of finishing high school at time to enroll at the physical education college as was his wish, but later on, after finishing high school in the special examination period of September,

Educação Física (ISEF) to study physical education [24] [37] After 1989, the Higher Institute of Physical Education (ISEF) became the Faculdade de Motricidade Humana (FMH), or Faculty of Human Kinetics, in English, and since then it was a part of the Technical University of Lisbon that would award a honoris causa doctorate degree to Mourinho in 2009 [38] [39] After he concluded his

world, at least at elite level, José Mourinho stands alone He was at the greatest coaching seminar the world has seen  [at Barcelona in the mid-90s], when the game as we know it was shaped, but he did not draw the same lessons everybody else did The other eight  [future coaches who were also at the club] espoused the proactive, possession-based football seeded at the club by Vic Buckingham, developed by Rinus Michels and taken to new levels by Johan Cruyff Mourinho, however, was different Mourinho believed in reactive football He was the outsider, the outcast who now revels in his role as the dark lord Saturday's game against Manchester United was typical Others, playing at home in a match that could effectively ensure the title, might have felt compelled to attack Mourinho  [as manager of Chelsea] fielded Kurt Zouma, a central defender, in midfield, sitting deep, and won the game with 28% possession.\n\n\nTactics\nIn the modern world, at least at elite level, José Mourinho

it for two reasons One, because we only had 10 men and two, because we beat them 3–1 at San Siro, not by parking the bus, or the boat or the airplane but by smashing them.\"\n\n\nMedia attention and controversies\nFollowing a Champions League tie between Chelsea and Barcelona in March 2005, Mourinho accused referee Anders Frisk and Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of breaking FIFA rules by having a

knew other Monacos such as the principality, or Bayern Munich, known in Italy as Bayern Monaco [318] [319]\n\n\nComparison with Mancini\nOn 9 November 2008, after Inter defeated Udinese 1–0 via a late

[328]\n\n\nZeru tituli conference\nDuring a press conference on 3 March 2009, Mourinho said that Milan and Roma would end the season with no honours and alleged that Juventus had collected a lot of points thanks to referees' mistakes; he also accused Italian sport journalists of \"intellectual prostitution\" on their behalf, as they were focusing on a possible mistake regarding a penalty conceded to Inter against Roma instead of talking about the failures of Inter's rivals [329] [316] [330]\n\n\nItaly national team representatives\nMourinho once again sparked controversy in the summer

gesture\nDuring the Serie A game against Sampdoria on 22 February 2010, which ended in a 0–0 draw, with two Inter players being sent off in the first half, Mourinho was disappointed by Paolo

the refereeing performance, and caused a three-game ban against Mourinho [351] Further complaining happened in the second half, when the referee denied Inter a penalty, booking Samuel Eto'o for diving

statement\nIn February 2010, both Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri and Napoli equivalent Walter Mazzarri released some comments critical of Mourinho: the former said that it was too easy to switch from Chelsea under Roman Abramovich to Massimo Moratti at Inter; the latter stated that he had won more than Mourinho in proportion Despite Moratti's decision to order a press blackout for Inter
