He is a long-time member of the Italian Communist Party and has held various positions in government and politics throughout his career.\n\nNapolitano was born in Naples, Italy, to a family of moderate means. His early life was marked by the tumultuous years of World War II and the subsequent rise of fascist rule in Italy. These events would later shape his commitment to anti-fascism and left-wing politics.\n\n**Early life**\n\nNapolitano was born in Naples on June 8, 1925. His father, Gennaro Napolitano, was a railway worker, and his mother, Ida Guerrisi, was a homemaker. The family lived in a modest apartment in the Sanità neighborhood of Naples, a working-class area with a strong socialist presence.\n\nNapolitano's early life was influenced by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, which had come to power in 1922. The fascist regime implemented strict controls over the press, imposed censorship, and suppressed opposition. As a child, Napolitano witnessed the effects of fascist rule firsthand, including the forced recruitment of young men into the Italian military.\n\n**Early political career**\n\n### World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nAs World War II began in 1939, Napolitano's family was affected by the conflict. His father was called to serve in the Italian military, and his brother, Mario, was drafted into the army at a young age. Napolitano himself was imprisoned for a short time in 1943 for distributing anti-fascist pamphlets.\n\nIn 1943, Napolitano joined the Italian Partisans, a network of anti-fascist groups that operated in secret. As a member of the Partisans, Napolitano participated in sabotage operations against the fascist regime and helped to smuggle Allied soldiers across the Italian border.\n\n### From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nAfter the war, Napolitano returned to Naples and began studying law at the University of Naples. He became involved in left-wing politics, joining the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1943. The PCI was a major player in Italian politics, and Napolitano quickly rose through the ranks.\n\nIn the 1950s, Napolitano was involved in various aspects of PCI politics, including trade union activism and local government. He played a key role in the PCI's 1956 Congress, which debated the party's stance on the Hungarian Revolution. Napolitano supported the PCI's position in favor of Soviet intervention in Hungary, which was seen as a necessary measure to suppress the revolution.\n\n**Leading member of the Italian Communist Party**\n\n### From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn the 1960s, Napolitano became a key figure in the PCI, serving as the party's Secretary of Organization from 1964 to 1969. He played a leading role in the PCI's efforts to reform and modernize the party, introducing new ideas and strategies to appeal to a broader base of voters.\n\nUnder Napolitano's leadership, the PCI began to adopt more pragmatic and centrist positions, distancing itself from the Soviet Union and its hard-line stance on communism. This shift helped to increase the party's popularity and influence in Italian politics.\n\n### After the Italian Communist Party\n\nIn 1991, the PCI merged with other left-wing parties to form the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS). Napolitano remained a key figure in the PDS, serving as its Vice-Secretary from 1991 to 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Napolitano was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower house of parliament. He served as the President of the Chamber from 1992 to 1994, playing a key role in the passage of various laws and reforms.\n\n**President of the Chamber of Deputies**\n\nNapolitano's tenure as President of the Chamber was marked by controversy and conflict. In 1993, he was involved in a dispute with the Chamber's Speaker, Giorgio La Malfa, which led to a temporary suspension of parliamentary activities.\n\nIn 1994, Napolitano resigned as President of the Chamber, citing disagreements with the party leadership and his own role in the party.\n\n**Late 1990s and early 2000s**\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano continued to play a key role in Italian politics, serving as the leader of the PDS and later the Democratic Party (DS). He was involved in various aspects of party politics, including trade union activism and local government.\n\nIn 2005, Napolitano was elected as the President of Italy, succeeding Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.\n\n**President of Italy**\n\n### First term (2006–2013)\n\n#### Election\n\nNapolitano was elected as President of Italy on May 10, 2006, with 543 votes out of 980. He was the first Italian President to be elected by the newly formed Italian Parliament, which had been formed after the general elections of 2006.\n\n#### Prodi Cabinet\n\nDuring his first term as President, Napolitano worked closely with the Prodi Cabinet, which was formed in 2006. The Cabinet was led by Romano Prodi, a former President of the European Commission, and was marked by a centrist and pragmatic approach to politics.\n\n#### 2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, the Italian government faced a major crisis, with the collapse of the Prodi Cabinet in December 2008. Napolitano played a key role in the subsequent crisis, helping to broker a deal between the government and the opposition.\n\n#### Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano was involved in a controversy surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a woman who was in a coma and whose parents had been fighting to have her life support withdrawn. Napolitano intervened in the case, using his powers as President to allow Englaro's parents to have her life support withdrawn.\n\n#### 2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, the Italian government faced another major crisis, with the collapse of the Berlusconi Cabinet in November 2011. Napolitano played a key role in the subsequent crisis, helping to broker a deal between the government and the opposition.\n\n### Second term (2013–2015)\n\n#### Re-election\n\nNapolitano was re-elected as President of Italy on April 20, 2013, with 738 votes out of 1,009.\n\n#### Letta Cabinet\n\nDuring his second term as President, Napolitano worked closely with the Letta Cabinet, which was formed in 2013. The Cabinet was led by Enrico Letta, a former Minister of Economy and Finance, and was marked by a centrist and pragmatic approach to politics.\n\n#### Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano's government was replaced by the Renzi Cabinet, which was led by Matteo Renzi, a former Mayor of Florence. Napolitano played a key role in the transition, helping to ensure a smooth handover of power.\n\n**Resignation**\n\nIn January 2015, Napolitano announced that he would be resigning as President of Italy, citing his advanced age and his desire to step down.\n\n**Later life**\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano returned to private life, where he continues to be involved in various aspects of politics and public life.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nNapolitano has been married to his wife, Clio Maria Russell, since 1947. The couple has no children.\n\n### Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has a complex relationship with the Catholic Church, which has been a dominant force in Italian society for centuries. In 2010, Napolitano sparked controversy by saying that the Church's teachings on abortion and euthanasia were \"not in line with the principles of democracy.\"\n\n### Death and state funeral\n\nNapolitano passed away on December 23, 2019, at the age of 94. He was given a state funeral, attended by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and other high-ranking officials.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nNapolitano's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting his long and varied career in politics. He is remembered as a key figure in the development of the Italian Communist Party and its transformation into the Democratic Party. He played a crucial role in the country's politics, serving as President of Italy and helping to broker deals between the government and the opposition.\n\n**Electoral history**\n\n### First-past-the-post elections\n\n* 1948 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1953 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1963 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1968 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1972 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1976 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1979 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1983 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1987 Italian general election: No seat\n* 1992 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Italian Communist Party)\n* 1994 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Democratic Party of the Left)\n* 1996 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Democratic Party of the Left)\n* 2001 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Democrats of the Left)\n* 2006 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Democratic Party)\n* 2008 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Democratic Party)\n* 2013 Italian general election: Chamber of Deputies (elected as a member of the Democratic Party)\n\n### Presidential elections\n\n* 1999 Italian presidential election: None ( runner-up )\n* 2006 Italian presidential election: Elected as President of Italy\n* 2013 Italian presidential election: Re-elected as President of Italy\n\n**Honours**\n\n### National honours\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2006)\n* Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2002)\n* Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (1998)\n\n### Foreign honours\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Stars (Latvia, 2006)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Double Cross (Slovakia, 2007)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Italy (Austria, 2008)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion of Finland (Finland, 2009)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Golden Ark (Netherlands, 2010)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Aztec Eagle (Mexico, 2011)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Three Alliances (Germany, 2012)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Italian politicians\n* List of presidents of Italy\n* Italian Communist Party\n* Democratic Party of the Left\n* Democrats of the Left\n* Democratic Party (Italy)\n* List of members of the Democratic Party (Italy)\n\n**References**\n\n* Napolitano, G.

Judges are appointed by the President, while court assessors are appointed by the Minister of Justice.\n\n### National Council of the Judiciary\n\nThe National Council of the Judiciary (Rada Krajowa Sądownictwa) is a body that oversees the appointment and management of judges and court assessors. It is composed of seven members, including the President and the Minister of Justice.\n\n#### Procedure of Appointment\n\nThe procedure for appointing judges and court assessors involves several steps, including:\n\n* **Nomination**: The President nominates candidates for the position of judge or court assessor.\n* **Review**: The National Council of the Judiciary reviews the nominations and makes recommendations to the President.\n* **Appointment**: The President appoints the nominated candidate to the position.\n\n#### Rights and Duties\n\nJudges and court assessors have several rights and duties, including:\n\n* **Independence**: Judges and court assessors are independent and impartial in their decision-making.\n* **Confidentiality**: Judges and court assessors are required to maintain confidentiality in their decision-making.\n* **Accountability**: Judges and court assessors are accountable to the National Council of the Judiciary and the President.\n\n### Judges Sitting in the Tribunals\n\nJudges sitting in the tribunals are judges who have been appointed to sit in the tribunals.

Cases can take several years to resolve, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies in the system.\n\n### Lack of Popular Support and Trust\n\nThe Polish judiciary has faced criticism for a lack of popular support and trust.

The incident sparked widespread concern and controversy, with many countries expressing concerns about national security and sovereignty.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History and development of reconnaissance balloons\n\nReconnaissance balloons have been used by various countries for decades as a means of gathering intelligence and conducting surveillance. These balloons can be equipped with a range of sensors and payloads, including cameras, radar, and communication equipment, to gather information on enemy military movements, infrastructure, and other sensitive targets.\n\n#### Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects\n\nIn the past, China has launched several reconnaissance balloons into the skies above the United States and other countries. These balloons have often been detected and tracked by military and civilian radar systems, but they have rarely been shot down. In some cases, these balloons have been allowed to drift away, with some being recovered by the U.S. military for analysis.\n\n### U.S.–China tensions\n\nThe relationship between the United States and China has been strained in recent years, with tensions rising over a range of issues, including trade, security, and human rights. The U.S. has accused China of engaging in aggressive military behavior, including the use of surveillance balloons and other spy craft, to gather intelligence on U.S. military operations and strategic assets.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Balloon\n\nThe balloon that sparked the 2023 incident was reportedly a large, high-altitude surveillance balloon, measuring approximately 200 feet (60 meters) in length and 50 feet (15 meters) in diameter. The balloon was equipped with a range of sensors and payloads, including cameras and communication equipment, to gather information on U.S. military movements and other sensitive targets.\n\n#### Size, propulsion, and payload\n\nThe balloon was reportedly powered by a combination of solar panels and a high-pressure gas system, allowing it to stay aloft for extended periods of time. The exact composition of the balloon's payload is not publicly known, but it is believed to have included a range of sensors and communication equipment to gather information on U.S. military operations and strategic assets.\n\n#### Signals intelligence capabilities\n\nThe balloon was reportedly equipped with advanced signals intelligence capabilities, allowing it to intercept and analyze a range of communication signals, including military communications, satellite communications, and other sensitive transmissions.\n\n### Detection\n\nThe balloon was first detected by U.S. radar systems on January 28, 2023, over the state of Montana. The U.S. military tracked the balloon as it drifted eastward, passing over several states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska.\n\n### Flight path\n\nThe balloon's flight path was monitored by U.S. military and civilian radar systems, with the balloon reportedly passing over several major military bases and strategic assets, including the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.\n\n### U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence\n\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies closely monitored the balloon's flight path and activities, with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force reportedly tracking the balloon's signals and detecting its presence using a range of sensors and radar systems.\n\n### Downing\n\nThe balloon was finally shot down by a U.S. Air Force F-22 fighter jet on February 4, 2023, over the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of South Carolina. The downing of the balloon sparked widespread celebration in the United States, with many expressing relief and gratitude that the balloon had been detected and destroyed.\n\n### Debris recovery\n\nThe U.S. military recovered debris from the balloon, including the balloon's payload and other equipment, for analysis and study. The debris was reportedly taken to a secure facility for further analysis, with the U.S. military and intelligence agencies studying the debris to gain insights into China's surveillance capabilities and intentions.\n\n**Legality of airspace and downing**\n\nThe downing of the balloon sparked debate over the legality of the U.S. action, with some arguing that the balloon was in international airspace and that the U.S. had no right to shoot it down. Others argued that the balloon was a clear threat to U.S. national security and that the downing was justified.\n\n**Response and reactions**\n\n### United States\n\nThe U.S. government responded to the incident with outrage and condemnation, with President Joe Biden calling the balloon's presence \"an unacceptable violation of U.S. sovereignty.\" The U.S. military and intelligence agencies were praised for their swift and decisive action in responding to the incident.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Canadian government expressed support for the U.S. response, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling the balloon's presence \"an unwelcome intrusion\" into Canadian airspace.\n\n### China\n\nChina responded to the incident with anger and denials, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning calling the downing of the balloon an \"overreaction\" and a \"serious violation of international law.\" China claimed that the balloon was a civilian research balloon that had strayed into U.S. airspace by accident.\n\n### NATO\n\nNATO officials expressed concern over the incident, with Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg calling the balloon's presence \"a serious threat to the security and stability of the region.\" NATO allies were reportedly briefed on the incident and were advised to be vigilant in monitoring for similar incidents.\n\n### Australia\n\nThe Australian government expressed support for the U.S. response, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling the balloon's presence \"an unacceptable threat to Australia's national security.\"\n\n### Japan\n\nThe Japanese government expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida calling the balloon's presence \"a serious threat to Japan's national security.\" Japan reportedly increased its military presence in the region in response to the incident.\n\n### Singapore\n\nThe Singapore government expressed concern over the incident, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong calling the balloon's presence \"an unwelcome intrusion\" into Singapore's airspace.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nThe UK government expressed support for the U.S. response, with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak calling the balloon's presence \"an unacceptable threat to the UK's national security.\"\n\n### Venezuela\n\nThe Venezuelan government expressed support for China's response, with President Nicolás Maduro calling the downing of the balloon \"an act of aggression\" against China.\n\n### Media reactions\n\n#### Analysis\n\nMedia analysts and experts were quick to weigh in on the incident, with many arguing that the balloon's presence was a clear threat to U.S. national security and that the downing was justified. Others argued that the incident highlighted the need for greater cooperation and communication between the U.S. and China to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n#### Satire\n\nSome media outlets and commentators used satire to poke fun at the incident, with many joking that the balloon was just a lost tourist trying to get to the nearest Starbucks.

These wells pose significant environmental and economic risks to the province, including fugitive gas emissions, surface casing vent flow (SCVF), and gas migration (GM). This article provides an overview of the context, landowners and municipalities, the Orphan Well Association, funding, the Alberta Energy Regulator, legal and regulatory considerations, environmental impacts, and potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells.\n\n# Current Overview\n\nAs of 2022, there are approximately 94,000 abandoned oil and gas wells in Alberta, with many more expected to be abandoned in the coming years due to declining oil prices and increased regulatory requirements. The majority of these wells are in the province's rural areas, where they can pose significant environmental and health risks to nearby residents. The economic impact of orphan wells is also substantial, with estimates suggesting that it can take up to $100,000 to plug and abandon a single well.\n\n# Context\n\nThe oil and gas industry has been a significant contributor to Alberta's economy for decades, with the province being one of the largest producers of oil and gas in Canada. However, the industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, including declining oil prices, increased regulatory requirements, and environmental concerns. As a result, many oil and gas companies have gone bankrupt or become insolvent, leaving behind abandoned wells that pose significant risks to the environment and local communities.\n\n# Landowners and Municipalities\n\nLandowners and municipalities in Alberta often bear the brunt of the costs associated with orphan wells. When a well is abandoned, the landowner is left responsible for maintaining the well and ensuring that it does not pose a risk to the environment or nearby residents. However, many landowners do not have the financial resources or expertise to properly maintain abandoned wells, leading to significant environmental and health risks.\n\nIn some cases, municipalities have taken on the responsibility of plugging and abandoning orphan wells, but this can be a costly and time-consuming process. The City of Calgary, for example, has estimated that it will cost over $1 billion to plug and abandon the approximately 1,000 orphan wells on municipal land.\n\n# Orphan Well Association\n\nThe Orphan Well Association (OWA) is a non-profit organization that was established in 2018 to address the issue of orphan wells in Alberta. The OWA works with government agencies, industry stakeholders, and landowners to identify and prioritize orphan wells for abandonment and remediation. The organization also provides education and awareness-raising activities to help prevent orphan wells from being created in the first place.\n\n# OWA Funding\n\nThe OWA receives funding from a variety of sources, including the Alberta government and the federal government. In 2020, the Alberta government announced a $1 billion funding commitment to support the OWA's efforts to plug and abandon orphan wells. The federal government has also provided funding to support the OWA's activities, including a $135 million contribution in 2020.\n\n## Federal and Provincial Subsidies\n\nIn addition to funding from the OWA, the Alberta and federal governments have also provided subsidies to support the abandonment of orphan wells. The Alberta government has established a program to provide financial assistance to landowners and municipalities to help cover the costs associated with plugging and abandoning orphan wells. The federal government has also provided funding to support the abandonment of orphan wells, including a $100 million contribution in 2020.\n\n# Alberta Energy Regulator\n\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is the regulatory body responsible for overseeing the oil and gas industry in Alberta. The AER has a number of responsibilities related to orphan wells, including ensuring that companies properly abandon and maintain wells, and enforcing regulations related to well abandonment and remediation. The AER has also established a program to provide financial assistance to landowners and municipalities to help cover the costs associated with plugging and abandoning orphan wells.\n\n# Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n\nThe issue of orphan wells is also subject to a number of legal and regulatory considerations. The polluter pays principle, for example, holds that companies responsible for environmental damage should be required to pay for the costs associated with cleanup and remediation. In the case of orphan wells, this principle suggests that companies that abandoned wells should be responsible for the costs associated with plugging and abandoning those wells.\n\n## Polluter Pays Principle\n\nThe polluter pays principle is a key concept in environmental law, holding that companies responsible for environmental damage should be required to pay for the costs associated with cleanup and remediation. In the case of orphan wells, this principle suggests that companies that abandoned wells should be responsible for the costs associated with plugging and abandoning those wells.\n\n## Suspended Inactive Wells\n\nSuspended inactive wells are wells that are no longer producing oil or gas, but are not yet abandoned. These wells can pose a number of risks to the environment and local communities, including fugitive gas emissions and surface casing vent flow (SCVF). The AER has established a program to require companies to plug and abandon suspended inactive wells, but this can be a time-consuming and costly process.\n\n# Bankruptcies and Orphan Wells\n\nBankruptcies and orphan wells are closely linked, with many oil and gas companies going bankrupt and leaving behind abandoned wells. In some cases, companies may have strategically packaged costly liabilities, such as orphan wells, with productive assets in order to avoid paying for the costs associated with plugging and abandoning those wells.\n\n## Strategic Packaging of Costly Liabilities with Productive Assets\n\nSome companies have been accused of strategically packaging costly liabilities, such as orphan wells, with productive assets in order to avoid paying for the costs associated with plugging and abandoning those wells. This can involve packaging the liabilities with assets that are still producing oil or gas, and then selling the assets as a single unit. This can make it difficult for regulators to require companies to pay for the costs associated with plugging and abandoning orphan wells.\n\n# Environmental Impacts of Orphan Wells\n\nOrphan wells can have a number of environmental impacts, including fugitive gas emissions, surface casing vent flow (SCVF), and gas migration (GM). Fugitive gas emissions occur when gas escapes from a well and is released into the atmosphere, while SCVF occurs when gas is released from the well through the surface casing. GM occurs when gas migrates through the soil and into nearby water sources.\n\n## Fugitive Gas Emissions\n\nFugitive gas emissions are a significant environmental concern associated with orphan wells. Gas that escapes from a well can contribute to climate change, and can also pose a risk to nearby residents and wildlife.\n\n## Surface Casing Vent Flow (SCVF) and Gas Migration (GM)\n\nSCVF and GM are also significant environmental concerns associated with orphan wells. SCVF occurs when gas is released from the well through the surface casing, while GM occurs when gas migrates through the soil and into nearby water sources. Both SCVF and GM can pose a risk to nearby residents and wildlife.\n\n# Potential Geothermal Conversion of Orphan Wells in Alberta\n\nOrphan wells in Alberta may have the potential for geothermal conversion, which could provide a new source of renewable energy for the province. Geothermal conversion involves using the heat from the earth to generate electricity, and could be a promising opportunity for Alberta to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe issue of orphan wells is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires a coordinated response from government agencies, industry stakeholders, and landowners. The OWA, AER, and other organizations are working together to address the issue of orphan wells, including providing funding and support for the abandonment of orphan wells, and enforcing regulations related to well abandonment and remediation.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Fossil fuel industry\n* Environmental impact of the fossil fuel industry\n* Climate change\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is intended to provide a general overview of the issue of orphan wells in Alberta, Canada, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive treatment of the subject.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Orphan Well Association\n* Alberta Energy Regulator\n* Government of Alberta: Orphan Wells\n* University of Calgary: Orphan Well Research", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Orphan_wells_in_Alberta,_Canada\" following this outline:\n\n#Current overview\n#Context\n#Landowners and municipalities\n#Orphan Well Association\n#OWA funding\n##Federal and provincial subsidies\n#Alberta Energy Regulator\n#Legal and regulatory considerations\n##Polluter pays principle\n##Suspended inactive wells\n#Bankruptcies and orphan wells\n##Strategic packaging of costly liabilities with productive assets\n#Environmental impacts of orphan wells\n##Fugitive gas emissions\n##Surface casing vent flow (SCVF) and gas migration (GM)\n#Potential geothermal conversion of orphan wells in Alberta\n#Responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#External links\n#Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including a sharp rise in interest rates, a decline in the value of technology stocks, and a resulting decrease in the value of assets held by these banks.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2023 United States banking crisis was one of the largest and most complex banking crises in US history. It highlighted the fragility of the US banking system and the need for regulators to implement more robust risk management practices. The crisis also led to a significant increase in interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy, and a decline in economic growth.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe US banking system has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a significant increase in loan losses and a decline in interest income. Additionally, the rise of fintech companies and digital banking platforms has disrupted traditional banking business models, leading to increased competition and decreased profitability.\n\nIn the months leading up to the crisis, several large US banks had reported significant losses due to the decline in the value of their assets and the rise in interest rates. These losses were driven by a combination of factors, including a sharp decline in the value of technology stocks and a resulting decrease in the value of assets held by these banks.\n\n**Liquidation of Silvergate Bank**\n\nSilvergate Bank, a California-based bank, was one of the first major banks to collapse during the crisis. The bank had been a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, and its failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of cryptocurrency assets and a failure to properly manage its risk exposure.\n\n### Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was founded in 1988 and had been a major player in the cryptocurrency industry since 2013. The bank had provided banking services to several prominent cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase and Gemini. However, the bank's reliance on cryptocurrency assets made it vulnerable to market fluctuations, and its failure was attributed to a decline in the value of these assets.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of cryptocurrency assets and a failure to properly manage its risk exposure. The bank's collapse led to a significant increase in interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy, and a decline in economic growth.\n\n**Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank, a California-based bank, was one of the largest banks to collapse during the crisis. The bank had been a prominent player in the technology industry, and its failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of technology stocks and a resulting decrease in the value of assets held by the bank.\n\n### Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 and had been a major player in the technology industry since the 1990s. The bank had provided banking services to several prominent technology companies, including Apple and Google. However, the bank's reliance on technology stocks made it vulnerable to market fluctuations, and its failure was attributed to a decline in the value of these stocks.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of technology stocks and a resulting decrease in the value of assets held by the bank. The bank's collapse led to a significant increase in interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy, and a decline in economic growth.\n\n**Collapse of Signature Bank**\n\nSignature Bank, a New York-based bank, was one of the last major banks to collapse during the crisis. The bank had been a prominent player in the fintech industry, and its failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of fintech assets and a failure to properly manage its risk exposure.\n\n### Background\n\nSignature Bank was founded in 2001 and had been a major player in the fintech industry since the 2010s. The bank had provided banking services to several prominent fintech companies, including Square and Stripe. However, the bank's reliance on fintech assets made it vulnerable to market fluctuations, and its failure was attributed to a decline in the value of these assets.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of fintech assets and a failure to properly manage its risk exposure. The bank's collapse led to a significant increase in interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy, and a decline in economic growth.\n\n**Collapse of First Republic Bank**\n\nFirst Republic Bank, a California-based bank, was one of the largest banks to collapse during the crisis. The bank had been a prominent player in the wealth management industry, and its failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of wealth management assets and a resulting decrease in the value of assets held by the bank.\n\n### Background\n\nFirst Republic Bank was founded in 1985 and had been a major player in the wealth management industry since the 1990s. The bank had provided banking services to several prominent wealth management companies, including Merrill Lynch and UBS. However, the bank's reliance on wealth management assets made it vulnerable to market fluctuations, and its failure was attributed to a decline in the value of these assets.\n\n### Events\n\nOn March 15, 2023, First Republic Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's failure was attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of wealth management assets and a resulting decrease in the value of assets held by the bank. The bank's collapse led to a significant increase in interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy, and a decline in economic growth.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe collapse of the four major banks led to a significant increase in interest rates, a tightening of monetary policy, and a decline in economic growth. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 1.5% in an effort to combat inflation and stabilize the banking system.\n\n### Bank Term Funding Program\n\nThe Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program to provide short-term funding to banks in need. The program provided banks with access to liquidity and helped to stabilize the banking system.\n\n### Government discussion of other funding\n\nThe government discussed the possibility of providing additional funding to banks, including the use of emergency loans and the sale of government securities. However, these measures were not implemented, and the banking system was left to rely on the Bank Term Funding Program.\n\n### U.S. investigations\n\nThe U.S. government launched an investigation into the collapse of the four major banks. The investigation focused on the banks' risk management practices and their failure to properly manage their risk exposure.\n\n### Economic impact\n\nThe collapse of the four major banks had a significant impact on the U.S. economy. The decline in economic growth was attributed to a decrease in consumer spending and a decline in business investment. The collapse also led to a sharp increase in unemployment and a decline in housing prices.\n\n### International impact\n\nThe collapse of the four major banks had a significant impact on the international economy. The decline in economic growth led to a decrease in trade and a decline in foreign investment. The collapse also led to a sharp increase in interest rates and a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of banks in the United States\n* List of banks that failed in the United States\n* History of banking in the United States\n* Financial crisis of 2007-2008\n* Great Depression", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_United_States_banking_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of Signature Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Collapse of First Republic Bank\n##Background\n##Events\n#Aftermath\n##Bank Term Funding Program\n##Government discussion of other funding\n##U.S. investigations\n##Economic impact\n##International impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Rishab Shetty, Sapthami Gowda, and Kishore in key roles. It is the directorial debut of Rishab Shetty, who also made his acting debut in the film. Kantara is a story of revenge, love, and identity, set against the backdrop of the forest and the injustices faced by the tribals.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story revolves around the protagonist, Shiva (played by Rishab Shetty), a woodcutter who lives in a small village on the outskirts of the forest. Shiva is a tribal who is deeply connected to nature and his community. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he is forced to confront the injustices and oppression faced by his community. The villagers, who are mostly non-tribals, are involved in various human rights violations, including land grabbing, deforestation, and exploitation of natural resources.\n\nShiva's younger brother, Srinivas (played by Kishore), is a victim of these injustices and is brutally killed by the villagers. Shiva, filled with anger and a desire for revenge, sets out on a journey to avenge his brother's death. Along the way, he meets a young woman named Bindhu (played by Sapthami Gowda), who is also a tribal and has her own story of trauma and loss.\n\nAs Shiva navigates his quest for revenge, he is forced to confront his own identity and the complexities of his community's history.

The film is the third installment in the Jurassic World trilogy and the sixth main installment in the Jurassic Park film series. It marks the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy and features an ensemble cast, including Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jeff Goldblum.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The story follows Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), and a team of scientists and military personnel as they attempt to contain and study the surviving dinosaurs. Meanwhile, a wealthy tech mogul, Biosyn, led by Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott), has been secretly collecting and experimenting on the dinosaurs, using their DNA to create new, more aggressive species.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Owen and Claire must navigate the complex web of human interests and dinosaur politics, all while facing a new threat: a genetically engineered, intelligent, and highly aggressive mosquito that has been created by Biosyn. The mosquito, which is a product of the same genetic engineering technology that created the dinosaurs, has the potential to wipe out human life on Earth.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Chris Pratt as Owen Grady\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing\n* Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm\n* Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler\n* Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant\n* DeWanda Wise as Kayla Watts\n* Mamoudou Athie as Charlie\n* BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu\n* Campbell Scott as Lewis Dodgson\n* Justice Smith as Franklin Webb\n* Omar Sy as Barry Sembène\n* Isiah Whitlock Jr. as Senator Darius Hoss\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Jurassic World Dominion began in 2015, shortly after the release of Jurassic World. Director Colin Trevorrow, who had previously directed Jurassic World, began developing the story and script with writer Emily Carmichael. The film was initially intended to be a direct sequel to Jurassic World, but Trevorrow and Carmichael ultimately decided to expand the story to include the original Jurassic Park characters, as well as new, more complex themes and plotlines.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2018, with Trevorrow and Carmichael continuing to develop the script and story. The film's budget was increased to accommodate the addition of new characters and plotlines, as well as the creation of new, more complex special effects.\n\n### Writing\n\nTrevorrow and Carmichael continued to work on the script throughout 2018 and 2019, incorporating feedback from Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment. The script was finalized in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting for the film began in 2019, with Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jeff Goldblum confirming their returns to the franchise. New cast members, including DeWanda Wise, Mamoudou Athie, and Campbell Scott, were also announced.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for Jurassic World Dominion began in April 2020, with a cast and crew of over 500 people. The film was shot on location in the United Kingdom, with additional filming taking place in the United States.\n\n#### COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the production of Jurassic World Dominion. Many of the film's cast and crew members had to be quarantined or tested for COVID-19, and some scenes were reshot or rewritten to accommodate the pandemic.\n\n#### Locations and sets\n\nThe film was shot on location in various locations, including the United Kingdom and the United States. The production team built a number of sets, including a large-scale dinosaur enclosure and a Biosyn laboratory.\n\n### Creatures on screen\n\nThe film features a number of new, genetically engineered dinosaurs, as well as the return of some classic characters. The production team used a combination of practical and CGI effects to bring the dinosaurs to life.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film began in 2020, with the film's editor, Mary Jo Markey, working closely with Trevorrow and Carmichael to finalize the film's cut. The film's score, composed by Michael Giacchino, was also completed during this time.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had previously scored Jurassic World. The score incorporates a number of themes and motifs from the original Jurassic Park film, as well as some new, more complex ideas.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nMarketing for the film began in 2021, with Universal Pictures releasing a number of trailers and promotional materials. The film's marketing campaign was centered around the idea of a \"dino-mite\" summer, with a focus on the film's action-packed and fun tone.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theaters\n\nJurassic World Dominion was released in theaters on June 10, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film was released in a number of formats, including IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media on August 23, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film is available in a number of formats, including Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nJurassic World Dominion performed well at the box office, grossing over $1.7 billion worldwide. The film was the highest-grossing film of 2022, and one of the highest-grossing films of all time.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's action-packed and fun tone. However, some critics felt that the film's plot was overly complex and that the film's themes were not fully developed.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film received a number of awards and nominations, including several Teen Choice Awards and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.\n\n**Future**\n\nThe success of Jurassic World Dominion has led to discussions about a potential reboot or spin-off of the franchise. However, at this time, there are no official plans for a new film or television series.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Jurassic Park\n* Jurassic World\n* Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\n* The Lost World: Jurassic Park\n* The Island of Dr. Moreau\n* The Land Before Time\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the film Jurassic World Dominion.

Chandrayaan-3 is the third lunar mission in the Chandrayaan program, following Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was conceived as a follow-up to the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which was launched in 2019 but failed to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface due to a technical malfunction. The ISRO initiated a detailed review of the mission failure and identified the key areas that needed improvement. The design and development of the Chandrayaan-3 mission were undertaken by ISRO's team of scientists and engineers, who incorporated several new technologies and systems to enhance the mission's success.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nThe primary objectives of the Chandrayaan-3 mission are to:\n\n1. Demonstrate a soft landing on the lunar surface using the Vikram lander.\n2. Conduct a range of scientific experiments on the lunar surface using the rover, Pragyan.\n3. Deploy a range of payloads on the lunar surface to study the Moon's composition, geology, and environment.\n4. Return high-resolution images and data from the lunar surface to Earth.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consists of three main components:\n\n### **Design**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is designed to be a multi-module spacecraft, consisting of a propulsion module, a lander, and a rover. The spacecraft is powered by a 500-Watt solar array and has a communication system that enables real-time communication with Earth.\n\n### **Propulsion module**\n\nThe propulsion module is the main engine of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft and is responsible for propulsion and navigation during the journey to the Moon. The propulsion module is powered by a 500-Watt solar array and has a communication system that enables real-time communication with Earth.\n\n### **Vikram lander**\n\nThe Vikram lander is a critical component of the Chandrayaan-3 mission and is designed to make a soft landing on the lunar surface. The Vikram lander is equipped with a range of sensors and instruments that enable it to navigate and communicate with the rover on the lunar surface.\n\n### **Rover Pragyan**\n\nThe rover Pragyan is a fully autonomous robotic rover that is designed to conduct a range of scientific experiments on the lunar surface. The rover is equipped with a range of instruments and sensors that enable it to study the lunar regolith, geology, and environment.\n\n## **Payloads**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission carries a range of payloads that are designed to study the lunar surface and subsurface. The payloads are categorized into three main groups:\n\n### **On lander**\n\n* **Lunar Regolith Instrument Package (LRIP)**: This payload is designed to study the lunar regolith, including its composition, texture, and structure.\n* **Lunar Surface Water Ice Explorer (LSWIE)**: This payload is designed to search for signs of water ice on the lunar surface.\n\n### **On rover**\n\n* **Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS)**: This payload is designed to study the chemical composition of the lunar regolith.\n* **Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR)**: This payload is designed to measure the distance between the rover and a retroreflector on the lunar surface.\n\n### **On the propulsion module**\n\n* **Lunar Magnetometer (LM)**: This payload is designed to study the lunar magnetic field and its interaction with the solar wind.\n* **Lunar Plasma Instrument (LPI)**: This payload is designed to study the lunar plasma and its interaction with the solar wind.\n\n**Mission profile**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission follows a complex trajectory that involves several critical phases:\n\n## **Launch**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was launched on July 14, 2023, from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India.\n\n## **Orbit**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was inserted into a lunar transfer orbit, which took it to the Moon over a period of a few days.\n\n## **Landing**\n\nThe Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module and made a soft landing on the lunar surface on August 23, 2023.\n\n## **Surface operations**\n\nThe rover Pragyan separated from the lander and began conducting scientific experiments on the lunar surface.\n\n## **Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth**\n\nThe propulsion module reinserted itself into a lunar orbit and began conducting a range of scientific experiments.\n\n## **Mission life**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is planned to last for several months, during which time the spacecraft will conduct a range of scientific experiments and return high-resolution images and data to Earth.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was led by a team of scientists and engineers from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), who designed and developed the spacecraft and its payloads. The team includes experts in fields such as propulsion, navigation, communication, and scientific instrumentation.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission was funded by the Government of India, with a budget of several hundred crores of rupees.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has achieved several significant results, including:\n\n## **Temperature variation**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has measured temperature variations on the lunar surface, which are crucial for understanding the lunar environment.\n\n## **Detection of sulfur**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected the presence of sulfur on the lunar surface, which is a key component of the lunar regolith.\n\n## **Plasma measurement**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has measured the lunar plasma and its interaction with the solar wind, which is crucial for understanding the lunar environment.\n\n## **Seismic measurements**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has made seismic measurements on the lunar surface, which provide valuable information about the lunar interior.\n\n**Domestic reactions**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has received widespread acclaim in India, with many praising the achievement as a major milestone in the country's space program.\n\n**International reactions**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has also received praise from international space agencies and experts, who have hailed the achievement as a significant milestone in the global space program.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission has won several awards and recognition, including the prestigious ISRO Award for Excellence in Space Science and Technology.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Chandrayaan-1\n* Chandrayaan-2\n* Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\n* Lunar exploration\n* Spacecraft design\n* Propulsion systems\n* Communication systems\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Chandrayaan-3 mission is a major milestone in India's space program and has achieved several significant results.\n* The mission has demonstrated a range of new technologies and systems, including a soft landing on the lunar surface and a fully autonomous rover.\n* The mission has also provided valuable information about the lunar environment, including temperature variations, sulfur detection, plasma measurement, and seismic measurements.\n\n**References**\n\n* [List of references]\n\n**External links**\n\n* [ISRO website]\n* [Chandrayaan-3 mission website]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chandrayaan-3\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Objectives\n#Spacecraft\n##Design\n###Propulsion module\n###Vikram lander\n###Rover pragyan\n##Payloads\n###On lander\n###On rover\n###On the propulsion module\n#Mission profile\n##Launch\n##Orbit\n##Landing\n##Surface operations\n##Propulsion module reinserted to orbit around Earth\n##Mission life\n#Team\n#Funding\n#Results\n##Temperature variation\n##Detection of sulfur\n##Plasma measurement\n##Seismic measurements\n#Domestic reactions\n#International reactions\n#Awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a rich history dating back thousands of years, Tartus has been an important center of trade, culture, and politics in the region.\n\n#Etymology\n\nThe name Tartus is derived from the Phoenician city of Arš, which was later known as Antaradus in Greek and Roman times. The name is believed to be derived from the Phoenician word for \"fortress\" or \"stronghold.\" Over the centuries, the name has undergone various changes, reflecting the city's strategic importance and its connections with neighboring cultures.\n\n#History\n\n##Phoenician Antaradus\n\nThe earliest recorded history of Tartus dates back to the Phoenician period, around the 8th century BCE.

During this period, Tartus was known for its skilled craftsmen, particularly in the production of fine glassware and metalwork.\n\n##Greco-Roman and Byzantine era\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, Tartus was conquered by the Seleucid Empire, a Hellenistic kingdom founded by Seleucus I Nicator. The city became an important center of Greek culture, with the establishment of a theater, a stadium, and other public buildings. In the 1st century CE, Tartus was incorporated into the Roman Empire, and it became a major center of trade and commerce in the region. During the Byzantine era, Tartus was an important bishopric, with a cathedral dedicated to St. George.\n\n##Early Islamic era\n\nIn the 7th century CE, Tartus was conquered by the Arabs, who introduced Islam to the region.

However, I can provide a comprehensive overview of the 2023-2024 Manipur violence in a neutral and encyclopedic tone.\n\n**2023-2024 Manipur Violence**\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence refers to a series of violent clashes that broke out in the Indian state of Manipur in May 2023. The violence began as a result of protests by the Meitei community against the Scheduled Tribe status granted to six communities in the state, which they claimed would lead to the erosion of their land and cultural rights.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n\nThe Meitei community, also known as the Meitheis, have been the dominant population in Manipur for centuries. However, the Indian government has long been contemplating granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to several communities in the state, including the six communities that were granted ST status in May 2023. The Meitei community has been opposed to this move, claiming that it would lead to the loss of their land and cultural rights.\n\n### Political background\n\nManipur has been plagued by ethnic conflicts and violence for decades, with various communities vying for power and resources. The state has a complex political landscape, with multiple parties and groups vying for power. The Meitei community has historically been the dominant force in Manipur politics, but the growing influence of other communities has led to tensions and conflicts.\n\n### Refugees from Myanmar\n\nManipur has been hosting a large number of refugees from Myanmar, who have been fleeing the ongoing conflict in the country. The refugees have been settled in various parts of the state, leading to tensions between the local population and the refugees.\n\n### International factors\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence has been linked to international factors, including the growing influence of China in the region and the ongoing conflict in Myanmar. The Indian government has been accused of using the violence to justify its own military operations in the region.\n\n**Antecedents**\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence was preceded by a series of protests and demonstrations by the Meitei community against the Scheduled Tribe status granted to the six communities. The protests were largely peaceful, but they were met with force by the police, leading to clashes between the two sides.\n\n**Overview**\n\n### Initial riots\n\nThe violence broke out on May 3, 2023, when a group of Meitei protesters clashed with the police in the state capital, Imphal. The clashes quickly spread to other parts of the state, with various communities vying for power and resources.\n\n### Government response\n\nThe Indian government responded to the violence by deploying troops to the state and imposing a curfew. The government also announced a number of measures to address the concerns of the Meitei community, including the withdrawal of the Scheduled Tribe status granted to the six communities.\n\n### Recurrent violence\n\nThe violence continued to recur over the next several weeks, with various communities vying for power and resources. The clashes were marked by widespread damage to property and infrastructure, as well as reports of human rights abuses.\n\n### Warring groups\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence involved several warring groups, including the Meitei community, the six communities that were granted Scheduled Tribe status, and various other ethnic and political groups. The groups clashed with each other over issues such as land, resources, and power.\n\n### Casualties and victims\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence resulted in widespread casualties and victims. According to reports, over 100 people were killed in the violence, while thousands more were injured or displaced. The violence also resulted in widespread damage to property and infrastructure.\n\n**Supreme Court proceedings**\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence led to a series of proceedings in the Supreme Court of India. The court was asked to intervene in the violence and to provide relief to the affected communities. The court also heard a number of petitions filed by various groups and individuals, including the Meitei community, seeking to address their concerns and grievances.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence received a range of reactions from various stakeholders, including the Indian government, the international community, and civil society organizations. The Indian government was criticized for its handling of the violence, while the international community called for restraint and dialogue. Civil society organizations also called for an end to the violence and for the protection of human rights.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\nThe 2023-2024 Manipur violence received extensive media coverage, with various news organizations reporting on the violence and its impact on the affected communities.

The opera is based on a Finnish folk tale and is considered one of Sibelius's most important works.\n\n##History\n\n###Composition\nThe Maiden in the Tower was Sibelius's first opera, and it was composed between 1893 and 1895. The opera was written in response to a commission from the Finnish Opera, and it premiered on January 18, 1896, at the Opera House in Helsinki.\n\n###Premiere\nThe premiere of The Maiden in the Tower was a significant event in Finnish cultural history. The opera was well-received by the audience and critics, with many praising its beauty and emotional depth. The opera's success helped to establish Sibelius as a leading figure in Finnish music.\n\n###Withdrawal and suppression\nDespite its initial success, The Maiden in the Tower was eventually withdrawn from the repertoire in the early 20th century. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is thought that the opera's nationalism and folkloric themes were deemed too radical for the tastes of the time. The opera was also criticized for its perceived lack of dramatic structure and its over-reliance on folk melodies.\n\n###Posthumous revival\nThe Maiden in the Tower was largely forgotten in the decades following its withdrawal from the repertoire. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a renewed interest in Sibelius's early works, and the opera was revived in several productions. Today, The Maiden in the Tower is considered one of Sibelius's most important operas, and it is performed regularly around the world.\n\n##Structure and roles\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is scored for a large orchestra and features a cast of four main characters:\n\n* The Maiden in the Tower (soprano)\n* The King (baritone)\n* The Huntsman (tenor)\n* The Old Woman (mezzo-soprano)\n\nThe opera's structure is typical of Sibelius's style, with a focus on atmospheric and descriptive music. The opera is divided into three acts, each of which explores a different aspect of the folk tale.\n\n##Synopsis\nThe Maiden in the Tower is based on a Finnish folk tale of the same name. The story tells the tale of a beautiful young woman who is imprisoned in a tower by a wicked old king. The king's intentions are thwarted by a brave huntsman who rescues the maiden and brings her to safety. Along the way, the huntsman must confront the king and his minions, and the maiden must confront her own feelings and desires.\n\n##Music\nThe music of The Maiden in the Tower is some of Sibelius's most beautiful and evocative. The opera features a wide range of melodies and themes, from the haunting beauty of the maiden's arias to the dramatic intensity of the king's scenes. The music is characterized by Sibelius's characteristic use of folk melodies and rhythms, as well as his innovative use of orchestration.\n\n##Context and analysis\n\n###The plot as allegory\nThe Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil, with the maiden representing innocence and purity and the king representing tyranny and oppression. The huntsman's role is that of the hero who comes to the maiden's rescue, symbolizing the power of courage and determination.\n\n###Opera and Finland's language strife\nThe Maiden in the Tower was one of the first operas to be composed in Finland, and it reflects the country's language strife at the time. The opera is written in Finnish, with some Swedish and Latin elements. Sibelius's use of Finnish as the primary language of the opera was a significant departure from the usual practice of writing operas in Italian or German.\n\n###Later opinions of Sibelius's music\nSibelius's music was not universally admired in the early 20th century. Some critics saw his music as overly nationalist and folkloric, while others saw it as lacking in dramatic structure and emotional depth. However, Sibelius's music has since been reevaluated, and he is now widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century.\n\n###Reasons for post-1981 neglect\nThe Maiden in the Tower was largely neglected after 1981, due to a combination of factors. The opera's nationalist and folkloric themes were seen as out of step with the modernist and avant-garde trends of the time. Additionally, the opera's dramatic structure and emotional depth were not considered to be up to the standards of the time. However, in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in Sibelius's early works, and The Maiden in the Tower is once again being performed and studied around the world.\n\n#Discography\n\n* The Maiden in the Tower, Op. 43 (1896)\n\t+ Helsinki, 1953 (Finnish Radio Choir and Orchestra)\n\t+ London, 1961 (Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus)\n\t+ Helsinki, 1978 (Finnish Radio Choir and Orchestra)\n\t+ New York, 1994 (New York Philharmonic and Chorus)\n\n#Notes, references, and sources\n\nNote: This article is based on a neutral, encyclopedic tone and excludes citations or references.

The election was called by the Governor of New South Wales after the Legislative Assembly was dissolved on 16 January 2023, following the resignation of the incumbent Premier, Dominic Perrottet, as leader of the Liberal Party.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous state election was held on 21 March 2019, and was won by the Coalition, comprising the Liberal and National parties, in a landslide victory. The Coalition won 53 out of 93 seats in the Legislative Assembly, while the Labor Party won 35 seats, and 5 seats went to independents and minor parties.\n\n### Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nIn January 2023, Dominic Perrottet resigned as leader of the Liberal Party and as Premier of New South Wales, citing the need for a change in leadership. He was replaced by Chris Minns, a former member of the Legislative Council, who became the new leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition. The Labor Party formed a minority government, with the support of a number of independent members and minor parties.\n\n### Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nThe possibility of a hung parliament was considered likely in the lead-up to the election, given the minority status of the Labor government and the large number of independents and minor parties holding seats in the Legislative Assembly.\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Policies\n\nThe Labor Party campaigned on a platform of increased spending on public services, including healthcare and education, as well as a number of policy initiatives aimed at addressing climate change and improving the state's infrastructure. The Liberal Party, on the other hand, campaigned on a platform of lower taxes and reduced spending on public services, as well as a number of policy initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing regulation.\n\n### Leaders' debates\n\nThe leaders of the two major parties, Chris Minns and Mark Speakman, participated in a series of debates and television interviews throughout the campaign, in which they outlined their policies and attacked their opponents. The debates were widely covered in the media and helped to shape public opinion in the lead-up to the election.\n\n**Redistribution**\n\nIn 2022, the New South Wales Electoral Commission conducted a redistribution of the state's electoral boundaries, which resulted in the creation of a number of new seats and the abolition of others. The redistribution was designed to ensure that the state's electoral boundaries were more accurately aligned with the state's population growth and demographic changes.\n\n**Registered parties**\n\nThe following parties were registered to contest the election:\n\n* Australian Labor Party\n* Liberal Party of Australia (NSW Division)\n* National Party of Australia (NSW Division)\n* Greens NSW\n* Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party\n* Animal Justice Party\n* Rural Workers Party\n* Socialist Alliance\n* Socialist Party of Australia\n\n**Results**\n\n### Legislative Assembly\n\nThe Labor Party won 42 seats in the Legislative Assembly, while the Liberal Party won 33 seats, the Nationals won 13 seats, and 5 seats went to independents and minor parties.\n\n#### Seats changing hands\n\nThe following seats changed hands at the election:\n\n* Albury: held by the Nationals, but won by the Labor Party\n* Bathurst: held by the Nationals, but won by the Liberal Party\n* Cessnock: held by the Labor Party, but won by the Liberal Party\n* Hawkesbury: held by the Nationals, but won by the Labor Party\n* Lake Macquarie: held by the Labor Party, but won by the Liberal Party\n* Newcastle: held by the Labor Party, but won by the Greens\n* Port Macquarie: held by the Nationals, but won by the Labor Party\n* Shellharbour: held by the Labor Party, but won by the Liberal Party\n* Tweed: held by the Nationals, but won by the Labor Party\n* Wagga Wagga: held by the Nationals, but won by the Liberal Party\n\n### Legislative Council\n\nThe Labor Party won 21 seats in the Legislative Council, while the Liberal Party won 15 seats, the Nationals won 4 seats, and 2 seats went to independents and minor parties.\n\n## Electoral pendulums\n\n### Pre-election pendulum\n\nThe pre-election pendulum showed the Labor Party leading in 47 seats, the Liberal Party leading in 39 seats, and the Nationals leading in 12 seats.\n\n### Post-election pendulum\n\nThe post-election pendulum showed the Labor Party leading in 42 seats, the Liberal Party leading in 33 seats, and the Nationals leading in 13 seats.\n\n### Notes\n\nThe electoral pendulum is a tool used to predict the outcome of elections based on the margin of victory in previous elections. It is not a guarantee of the outcome of future elections.\n\n**Candidates and retiring MPs**\n\nThe following candidates and retiring MPs stood for election:\n\n### Labor\n\n* Chris Minns, Leader of

Brown played as a halfback for the Cleveland Browns from 1957 to 1965, earning numerous accolades for his exceptional speed, power, and elusiveness on the field. After retiring from football, Brown went on to have a successful acting career, appearing in over 30 films and television shows.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJames Nathaniel Brown was born on February 17, 1936, in St. Simons, Georgia, to Edna and Swint Brown. He was the second of seven children, and his family moved to Vallejo, California, when he was eight years old. Brown grew up in a poor household, but his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a love of sports. He attended Will C. Wood High School in Vacaville, California, where he excelled in football, track, and basketball.\n\n**College Career**\n\nBrown attended Syracuse University on a full scholarship, where he played college football for the Syracuse Orange. During his time at Syracuse, Brown was an exceptional athlete, earning All-American honors in both football and track. He was a key player on the Orange's 1957 national championship team, which won the NCAA title with a 9-0 record. After graduating from Syracuse in 1957, Brown was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the sixth overall pick in the NFL Draft.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nBrown played for the Cleveland Browns from 1957 to 1965, earning a reputation as one of the greatest players in NFL history. He was a versatile running back who could excel in both the running and passing games, and his speed, power, and elusiveness made him nearly impossible to tackle. Brown was a 9-time Pro Bowl selection and was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1957, 1958, and 1965. He holds the NFL record for most career rushing yards per game (102.5), and his 12,312 rushing yards rank third all-time in NFL history.\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nAfter retiring from football in 1965, Brown turned his attention to acting. His first film role was in the 1967 film \"The Dirty Dozen,\" directed by Robert Aldrich. Brown went on to appear in over 30 films and television shows, including \"Ice Station Zebra,\" \"Any Which Way You Can,\" and \"The Running Man.\" He also made numerous television appearances, including a starring role in the 1970-1971 TV series \"The Silent Force.\"\n\n### Early Films\n\nBrown's early film career began with small roles in films such as \"The Dirty Dozen\" and \"Ice Station Zebra.\" He also appeared in several low-budget films, including \"100 Rifles\" and \"Run, Simon, Run.\" These early films helped Brown establish himself as a serious actor, and he soon began to attract more substantial roles.\n\n### Leading Man\n\nIn the early 1970s, Brown began to emerge as a leading man in films. He starred in several films, including \"The Running Man\" and \"Any Which Way You Can.\" These films showcased Brown's charisma and comedic timing, and he quickly became one of the most popular actors of the decade.\n\n### Co-starring\n\nBrown also co-starred in several films, including \"Three the Hard Way\" and \"The Tall Guy.\" These films allowed Brown to work with other talented actors, including Jim Kelly and Richard Pryor.\n\n### Later Acting Career\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Brown continued to work in film and television. He appeared in several films, including \"The Peacemaker\" and \"The Taking of Beverly Hills.\" He also made numerous television appearances, including a starring role in the 1990-1991 TV series \"A Different World.\"\n\n**Civil Rights Work**\n\nBrown was an active participant in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. He worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders, and he was a vocal advocate for racial equality. In 1968, Brown was a key figure in the Cleveland school boycott, which aimed to desegregate the city's schools.\n\n**Other Post-Football Activities**\n\nAfter retiring from football, Brown went on to become a successful businessman. He opened several restaurants and nightclubs in Cleveland, and he was a partner in a chain of car dealerships. Brown also became involved in politics, serving as a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\n**Assault Allegations**\n\nIn 2002, Brown was accused of assaulting a 47-year-old woman at a charity golf tournament in Cleveland. The woman claimed that Brown had punched her in the face and knocked her to the ground.

The state's unique geography, with its volcanic terrain and dense vegetation, makes it prone to fires that can spread quickly and uncontrollably.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nThe summer of 2023 saw an unusual combination of weather conditions that contributed to the spread of the wildfires. High temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds created conditions that were ripe for fires to start and spread rapidly.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires consisted of several major fires that burned across the state, with the most destructive ones occurring on the islands of Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Maui\n\n#### Kula\n\nThe Kula fire started on July 15, 2023, in the Kula District of Maui, and quickly spread to over 10,000 acres of land. The fire forced the evacuation of several neighborhoods and burned several homes, but fortunately, no fatalities were reported.\n\n#### Lahaina\n\nThe Lahaina fire started on July 20, 2023, in the historic town of Lahaina, and burned several buildings, including historic homes and businesses. The fire also forced the evacuation of several neighborhoods and caused significant damage to the town's infrastructure.\n\n#### Pūlehu-Kīhei\n\nThe Pūlehu-Kīhei fire started on July 25, 2023, in the Pūlehu-Kīhei area of Maui, and burned over 5,000 acres of land. The fire forced the evacuation of several neighborhoods and burned several homes, but fortunately, no fatalities were reported.\n\n#### Other fires\n\nSeveral other smaller fires broke out on Maui during the summer of 2023, including the Makena fire, which burned several acres of land in the Makena area, and the Kihei fire, which burned several homes and businesses in the Kihei area.\n\n### Hawaiʻi Island\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Island fire started on August 1, 2023, in the Kona District of the island, and burned over 15,000 acres of land. The fire forced the evacuation of several neighborhoods and burned several homes, but fortunately, no fatalities were reported.\n\n### Oʻahu\n\nThe Oʻahu fire started on August 10, 2023, in the Nuʻuanu Valley, and burned several acres of land. The fire forced the evacuation of several neighborhoods and burned several homes, but fortunately, no fatalities were reported.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires resulted in several fatalities, including a firefighter who died while battling the Pūlehu-Kīhei fire. Several others were injured, including civilians and firefighters.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe wildfires caused significant damage to properties and infrastructure across the state, including homes, businesses, and historic buildings. The total damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe wildfires also had a significant impact on the environment, with the loss of thousands of acres of land and the destruction of native ecosystems. The fires also released large amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants into the air, causing air quality to deteriorate and posing health risks to residents and visitors.\n\n### Evacuations\n\nSeveral neighborhoods were evacuated due to the wildfires, including areas in Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu. The evacuations were carried out by emergency services and military personnel, with residents and visitors being temporarily relocated to safer areas.\n\n### Wildlife and pets\n\nThe wildfires also had a significant impact on wildlife and pets, with several animal species being affected by the fires. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture reported that several animal species, including native birds and insects, were threatened by the fires.\n\n**Legal proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed in connection with the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, including a class-action lawsuit brought by residents and visitors against the state of Hawaii and several utility companies. The lawsuit alleged that the companies were responsible for the spread of the wildfires due to their failure to maintain power lines and other infrastructure.\n\n**Response**\n\n### Federal government\n\nThe federal government provided significant support to the state of Hawaii in response to the wildfires, including the deployment of military personnel and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also provided funding and resources to support the response efforts.\n\n### State government\n\nThe state government of Hawaii also played a key role in responding to the wildfires, with Governor Josh Green declaring a state of emergency and mobilizing emergency services and military personnel to support the response efforts.\n\n### International assistance\n\nSeveral international countries provided assistance to Hawaii in response to the wildfires, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hungary. The countries provided funding, equipment, and personnel to support the response efforts.\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan provided significant assistance to Hawaii in response to the wildfires, including the deployment of a disaster relief team and the provision of funding and equipment. The Japanese government also provided support to the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to help restore native ecosystems.\n\n### South Korea\n\nSouth Korea provided funding and equipment to support the response efforts, including the provision of firefighting equipment and personnel. The South Korean government also provided support to the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to help restore native ecosystems.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nTaiwan provided funding and equipment to support the response efforts, including the provision of firefighting equipment and personnel. The Taiwanese government also provided support to the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to help restore native ecosystems.\n\n### Hungary\n\nHungary provided funding and equipment to support the response efforts, including the provision of firefighting equipment and personnel. The Hungarian government also provided support to the Hawaii Department of Agriculture to help restore native ecosystems.\n\n**Fundraising and donations**\n\nSeveral fundraising campaigns were launched to support the response efforts and provide relief to those affected by the wildfires. The campaigns raised significant amounts of money, including over $10 million from the state of Hawaii and several private donors.\n\n**Concerns about preparedness**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires raised concerns about the preparedness of the state and its emergency services to respond to such disasters. Several experts and officials raised concerns about the lack of resources and infrastructure to support the response efforts, including the need for more funding and equipment.\n\n### New warning programs\n\nIn response to the wildfires, the state of Hawaii launched several new warning programs to provide early alerts and warnings to residents and visitors of potential wildfires. The programs included the use of social media and text messaging to provide real-time updates and warnings.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Hawaii wildfires\n* Wildfires in Hawaii\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date information.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Hawaii Department of Agriculture.

The dam is located on the Dnipro River, approximately 130 kilometers north of the city of Kherson. The dam's reservoir is a vital source of water for irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power generation.\n\nThe dam's destruction was a strategic goal of the Russian military during their invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The dam's destruction would have several benefits for the Russian military, including:\n\n1. Preventing the Ukrainian military from accessing the area and launching a counterattack.\n2. Reducing the Ukrainian military's ability to use the Dnipro River as a transportation route.\n3. Flooding the surrounding area and making it difficult for Ukrainian forces to operate.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam was destroyed by Russian forces on June 6, 2023, when they detonated explosives at the dam's crest. The explosion caused a significant breach in the dam, resulting in a rapid release of water from the reservoir. The resulting floodwaters overwhelmed the surrounding area, causing widespread destruction and displacement of local residents.\n\n**Responsibility**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is widely attributed to Russian forces, who have been accused of deliberately targeting the dam as part of their military strategy. The Ukrainian government and international organizations have condemned the destruction of the dam as a war crime, and have called for an investigation into the incident.\n\nThe Russian government has not officially acknowledged responsibility for the destruction of the dam, but has stated that the Ukrainian military was responsible for the damage. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim, and the majority of international observers have concluded that the Russian military was responsible for the destruction of the dam.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had significant effects on the surrounding region and beyond.\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe destruction of the dam has resulted in significant casualties, including:\n\n* Over 1,000 people have been killed or injured in the resulting floods.\n* Over 100,000 people have been displaced from their homes.\n* Many more people have been affected by the loss of their homes, livelihoods, and property.\n\n### Flooding and evacuations\n\nThe resulting floodwaters have caused widespread destruction and displacement in the surrounding area. Many residents were forced to evacuate their homes and seek shelter in nearby towns and cities.\n\n### Animals and environment\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a devastating impact on the local environment and wildlife. The floodwaters have killed many animals and destroyed their habitats, causing widespread concern about the long-term effects on the ecosystem.\n\n### Military impact\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had significant military implications. The dam's destruction has made it difficult for Ukrainian forces to access the area and launch a counterattack. Furthermore, the dam's destruction has disrupted the supply of hydroelectric power to nearby towns and cities, causing significant economic and social disruption.\n\n### Water supply\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a significant impact on the region's water supply. The dam was a vital source of drinking water for the surrounding area, and its destruction has left many communities without access to clean drinking water.\n\n### North Crimean Canal\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also affected the North Crimean Canal, a vital water supply canal that provides water to the Crimean Peninsula. The canal was not affected by the dam's destruction, but the resulting floodwaters have caused significant damage to the canal's infrastructure.\n\n### Farming\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a significant impact on the region's farming industry. Many farmers in the surrounding area rely on the dam's reservoir for irrigation, and its destruction has left them without access to this vital resource.\n\n### Fisheries\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a significant impact on the region's fisheries. The dam's reservoir was home to a variety of fish species, and its destruction has caused significant damage to the local fish population.\n\n### Energy\n\nThe destruction of the dam has also had a significant impact on the region's energy supply. The dam was a vital source of hydroelectric power for the surrounding area, and its destruction has left many communities without access to this vital resource.\n\n### Costs of reconstruction\n\nThe costs of reconstructing the dam and restoring the surrounding area are estimated to be significant. The Ukrainian government has requested international assistance to support the reconstruction efforts, but the exact costs of reconstruction are still unknown.\n\n**Legal responses**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has been widely condemned as a war crime by international organizations and governments around the world. The Ukrainian government has called for an investigation into the incident, and has requested that the International Criminal Court (ICC) take action against those responsible.\n\nThe ICC has launched an investigation into the destruction of the dam, and has issued a warrant for the arrest of several high-ranking Russian officials. However, the Russian government has refused to cooperate with the ICC, and has denied any responsibility for the destruction of the dam.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has caused significant concern and outrage around the world. The Ukrainian government and international organizations have condemned the destruction of the dam as a war crime, and have called for an investigation into the incident.\n\n### Ukrainian reactions\n\nThe Ukrainian government has condemned the destruction of the dam as a war crime, and has called for an investigation into the incident. President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that the destruction of the dam is a clear example of Russia's disregard for human life and the environment.\n\n### Russian reactions\n\nThe Russian government has denied any responsibility for the destruction of the dam, and has accused the Ukrainian military of causing the damage. However, there is no credible evidence to support this claim, and the majority of international observers have concluded that the Russian military was responsible for the destruction of the dam.\n\n### International reactions\n\nThe international community has condemned the destruction of the dam as a war crime, and has called for an investigation into the incident. The United Nations has expressed concern about the impact of the dam's destruction on the local population and the environment, and has called for support for the Ukrainian government's efforts to rebuild and restore the surrounding area.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had significant and far-reaching consequences for the surrounding region and beyond. The dam's destruction has caused widespread destruction and displacement, and has had a devastating impact on the local environment and wildlife.\n\nThe Ukrainian government and international organizations are working to support the reconstruction efforts and provide assistance to those affected by the destruction of the dam. However, the exact costs of reconstruction and the long-term effects of the dam's destruction are still unknown.\n\n**See also**\n\n### Similar international events\n\n* The destruction of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which was also targeted by Russian forces during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n* The destruction of the Vuhlehirska Power Plant, which was also targeted by Russian forces during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n### General\n\n* The effects of war on the environment and local populations.\n* The importance of international cooperation and diplomacy in preventing and responding to international conflicts.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available sources and has not been independently verified.\n* The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is a highly complex and sensitive topic, and the information in this article is intended to provide a general overview of the incident.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references, as the information is based on publicly available sources and has not been independently verified.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The official website of the Ukrainian government.\n* The official website of the Russian government.\n* The International Criminal Court (ICC).\n* The United Nations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Destruction\n#Responsibility\n#Effects\n##Casualties\n##Flooding and evacuations\n##Animals and environment\n##Military impact\n##Water supply\n##North Crimean Canal\n##Farming\n##Fisheries\n##Energy\n##Costs of reconstruction\n#Legal responses\n#Reactions\n##Ukrainian reactions\n##Russian reactions\n##International reactions\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n##Similar international events\n##General\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This domain is one of the three primary domains of life, the others being Archaea and Bacteria. Eukaryotes are found in a wide range of environments, from the simplest single-celled organisms to the most complex multicellular organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, and protists.\n\n# **Diversity**\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with over a million identified species, ranging in size, complexity, and behavior. They can be found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains. Eukaryotes include both unicellular and multicellular organisms, with many species exhibiting complex cellular structures and behaviors.\n\n## **Cellular Structure**\n\nEukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a true nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. This nucleus is surrounded by a region of cytoplasm, which is the jelly-like substance within the cell where many metabolic processes take place. Eukaryotic cells also contain a variety of other membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria, which generate energy for the cell, and chloroplasts, which are responsible for photosynthesis in plant cells.\n\n## **Biochemistry**\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex biochemical makeup, with many different metabolic pathways and processes taking place within the cell. They have a eukaryotic cell cycle, which includes phases of interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Eukaryotic cells also have a system of molecular signals that allow them to communicate with each other and coordinate their behaviors.\n\n## **Internal Membranes**\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex system of internal membranes, which include the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. These membranes are responsible for many different cellular functions, including the synthesis of proteins and lipids, the storage of nutrients and waste, and the regulation of cell growth and division.\n\n## **Mitochondria**\n\nMitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for generating energy for the cell through the process of cellular respiration. They contain their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from bacteria that were engulfed by the cell's ancestors.\n\n## **Plastids**\n\nPlastids are membrane-bound organelles found in plant cells that are responsible for photosynthesis. They contain the pigment chlorophyll and other pigments that absorb light energy and convert it into chemical energy. Plastids also contain other pigments, such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, which give plants their color.\n\n## **Cytoskeletal Structures**\n\nEukaryotic cells have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures, which include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. These structures provide support and shape to the cell, and are involved in many different cellular processes, including cell division, movement, and signaling.\n\n## **Cell Wall**\n\nThe cell wall is a rigid layer of material that surrounds the cell membrane in plant, fungal, and some bacterial cells. It provides support and protection to the cell, and helps to regulate the movement of substances in and out of the cell.\n\n## **Sexual Reproduction**\n\nEukaryotes exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, including both asexual and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes, each containing half the genetic material of the organism, to form a new individual with a unique combination of traits.\n\n# **Evolution**\n\n## **History of Classification**\n\nThe classification of eukaryotes has a long and complex history, dating back to the early 19th century. The concept of a domain of life consisting of eukaryotes, archaea, and bacteria was first proposed by Carl Woese in the 1970s.\n\n## **Phylogeny**\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is a complex and still-debated topic. The most widely accepted view is that eukaryotes evolved from a common ancestor with archaea, and that the two domains diverged around 2 billion years ago.\n\n## **Origin of Eukaryotes**\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is still a topic of ongoing research and debate. One theory is that eukaryotes evolved from a common ancestor with archaea, and that the two domains diverged around 2 billion years ago.\n\n## **Fossils**\n\nFossils of eukaryotes date back to the Proterozoic era, around 2.1 billion years ago. These early eukaryotes were likely single-celled organisms that lived in aquatic environments.\n\n# **See also**\n\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Eukaryotic cell\n* Evolution\n* Phylogeny\n* Cell biology\n\n# **References**\n\nNot included in this article.\n\n# **External links**\n\n* National Center for Biotechnology Information: Eukaryota\n* Wikipedia: Eukaryota", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the eldest son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence, and became king after the death of his father.\n\n**Early years, 1239–1263**\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on 17 June 1239 at Westminster Palace, London. He was the eldest son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence, and was named after his father. As a child, Edward was educated in Latin, French, and music, and was trained in arms and warfare. He was also groomed for a life of power and politics, and was given a seat on the Council of Regency when he was just a teenager.\n\nIn 1254, Edward was married to Eleanor of Castile, the daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, who sought to strengthen his ties with Castile and secure a strategic alliance. The marriage was a successful one, and Eleanor became one of Edward's closest advisors and confidantes.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nEdward's early ambitions were focused on expanding his power and influence within England. He was a skilled politician and strategist, and was determined to secure a strong position for himself within the royal family. He was also interested in military campaigns, and was eager to prove himself as a capable and effective leader.\n\nIn 1258, Edward was appointed as a member of the Council of Regency, which was tasked with governing England while his father was away on a trip to France. He used this opportunity to build his own power base, and to gather support for his future ambitions.\n\n**Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273**\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, Edward's father, King Henry III, was overthrown in a rebellion led by a group of barons. Edward was forced to flee to France, where he was received by his brother-in-law, King Louis IX. He spent several years in exile, during which time he built a small army and gathered support for his future campaign to reclaim the throne.\n\nIn 1267, Edward returned to England with a small army, and began a campaign to retake the throne. He was successful in his efforts, and was able to defeat the rebel barons at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. He then marched on London, where he was welcomed back as a hero.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1270, Edward joined his friend, King Louis IX, on a crusade to the Holy Land. However, the crusade was unsuccessful, and Louis died of dysentery in 1270. Edward returned to England, where he was greeted as a hero and a champion of the Christian faith.\n\nIn 1272, King Henry III died, and Edward succeeded him as king. He was crowned on 19 August 1274, and began a long and successful reign.\n\n**Early reign, 1274–1296**\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's first acts as king was to launch a campaign to conquer Wales. He had long been interested in expanding his power and influence in Wales, and saw the conquest of the country as a key part of his strategy. In 1277, he launched a military campaign against the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and was successful in defeating him at the Battle of Devynnock.\n\nEdward then imposed a series of harsh laws on the Welsh people, including the requirement that they pay taxes and provide military service to the English crown. He also established a number of English castles and garrisons throughout the country, which helped to secure his power and influence.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward was also interested in expanding his power and influence on the Continent, and launched a number of military campaigns in France and Scotland. He was a skilled diplomat, and was able to build alliances with a number of European powers, including the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nIn 1296, Edward launched a campaign to conquer Scotland, which was led by the English king, Alexander III. However, the campaign was unsuccessful, and Edward was forced to return to England.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nIn 1292, Edward launched the Great Cause, a campaign to establish English law and order in Scotland. The campaign was led by a group of English judges, who were tasked with establishing the boundaries of the English and Scottish crowns. The campaign was successful, and helped to secure English power and influence in Scotland.\n\n**Government and law**\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward was known for his strong personality and his determination to do what he thought was right. He was a skilled politician and strategist, and was able to build a powerful and effective government.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward was a strong supporter of the English law, and was responsible for establishing a number of key laws and institutions. He was also a skilled administrator, and was able to build a powerful and effective government.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward was also interested in the finances of the kingdom, and was responsible for establishing a number of key financial institutions. He was also a strong supporter of Parliament, and was able to use the institution to raise taxes and secure funding for his campaigns.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward launched a campaign to expel the Jews from England. The campaign was successful, and the Jews were forced to leave the country. The campaign was motivated by a desire to reduce the power and influence of the Jewish community in England.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward was also interested in the administration of Ireland, and launched a number of campaigns to establish English law and order in the country. He was a strong supporter of the English crown, and was able to use the crown to establish a powerful and effective government in Ireland.\n\n**Later reign, 1297–1307**\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis, when a group of English barons challenged his right to rule. The crisis was sparked by a dispute over the king's powers and the rights of the nobility. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it highlighted the tensions between the king and the nobility.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1298, Edward launched a campaign to return to Scotland, which was led by the English king, Alexander III. The campaign was successful, and Edward was able to reassert English power and influence in Scotland.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on 7 July 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, Cumberland. He was buried at Westminster Abbey, where he was joined by his wife, Eleanor of Castile.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a skilled politician and strategist, and was able to build a powerful and effective government. He was also a strong supporter of the English law, and was responsible for establishing a number of key laws and institutions. However, his legacy is also marked by controversy and conflict, including the expulsion of the Jews and the conquest of Wales.\n\n**Family**\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, the daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. The marriage was a successful one, and Eleanor became one of Edward's closest advisors and confidantes.\n\n### Second marriage\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, the daughter of King Philip IV of France. The marriage was arranged by Edward, who sought to secure a strategic alliance with France.\n\n### Genealogical table\n\nHere is a genealogical table of Edward's family:\n\n* Father: King Henry III of England\n* Mother: Eleanor of Provence\n* First wife: Eleanor of Castile\n* Second wife: Margaret of France\n* Children:\n\t+ John of Eltham\n\t+ Eleanor of Woodstock\n\t+ Joan of the Tower\n\t+ Alfonso of England\n\t+ Margaret of England\n\t+ Berengaria of England\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* List of Welsh monarchs\n* List of Scottish monarchs\n* List of monarchs of Castile\n* List of monarchs of Aragon\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exact dates of Edward's birth and death are not known.\n* The exact circumstances of Edward's death are not known.\n* The exact impact of Edward's policies on the Jewish community in England is not known.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on the following sources:\n\t+ \"Edward I\" by J.

It was the 11th parliamentary election since the fall of communism in 1989 and the fifth election held since the 2011 constitution came into effect.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe election was held during a time of political and social unrest in Hungary, with the country's opposition parties facing significant challenges in unifying against the ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The election was characterized by a highly polarized campaign, with the Fidesz party emphasizing national security and immigration issues, while the opposition focused on economic and social concerns.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2021, the Hungarian parliament passed a new electoral law, which introduced significant changes to the way elections would be conducted. The law reduced the number of constituency seats from 106 to 106, but increased the number of party list seats from 93 to 101. The law also introduced a new system of electoral districts, which were designed to favor the ruling Fidesz party.\n\n### Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the new electoral law, the opposition parties decided to unite behind a single joint list. The list, known as \"United for Hungary,\" was formed by the five main opposition parties: the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Coalition, the Momentum Movement, the LMP – Hungary's Green Party, and the Dialogue for Hungary. The joint list was led by Péter Márki-Zay, a former mayor of Hódmezővásárhely.\n\n### Opposition primary\n\nIn March 2022, the United for Hungary list held a primary election to determine its candidates for the parliamentary election. The primary was won by a number of notable opposition figures, including Márki-Zay, who emerged as the list's lead candidate.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nHungary uses a mixed electoral system, in which voters are able to vote for both a constituency candidate and a party list. The constituency candidates are elected through a first-past-the-post system, while the party list seats are allocated using a proportional representation system. The election is overseen by the National Election Committee, which is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nThe following parties and coalitions contested the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election:\n\n* Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz-KDNP)\n* United for Hungary (Együtt az Új Magyarországért)\n* Jobbik - Movement for a Better Hungary (Jobbik)\n* Our Homeland (Mi Hazánk)\n* Momentum Movement (Momentum)\n* LMP – Hungary's Green Party (LMP)\n* Dialogue for Hungary (Párbeszéd)\n* Democratic Coalition (DK)\n* Social Democratic Party (MSZP)\n* Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nA number of opinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election. These polls suggested that the ruling Fidesz party would likely emerge as the largest party in the election, but that the opposition coalition, United for Hungary, would be a strong second. Some polls suggested that the opposition coalition could potentially win the election, but these results were not universally consistent.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Result by constituency\n\nThe results of the election by constituency are as follows:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP: 52 seats\n* United for Hungary: 44 seats\n* Jobbik: 15 seats\n* Our Homeland: 6 seats\n* Momentum: 1 seat\n* LMP: 1 seat\n* Párbeszéd: 0 seats\n* DK: 0 seats\n* MSZP: 0 seats\n\n### Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe results of the party list election by county and in the diaspora are as follows:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP: 54.4% (47 seats)\n* United for Hungary: 34.6% (31 seats)\n* Jobbik: 4.4% (3 seats)\n* Our Homeland: 2.4% (2 seats)\n* Momentum: 1.3% (1 seat)\n* LMP: 1.2% (1 seat)\n* Párbeszéd: 0.6% (0 seats)\n* DK: 0.5% (0 seats)\n* MSZP: 0.4% (0 seats)\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was widely seen as a significant setback for the country's opposition parties. Despite winning a significant number of seats, the United for Hungary coalition was unable to prevent the ruling Fidesz party from emerging as the largest party in the election. The election was characterized by a highly polarized campaign, with the Fidesz party emphasizing national security and immigration issues, while the opposition focused on economic and social concerns.\n\n### Conduct\n\nThe election was generally seen as being conducted in a free and fair manner. The National Election Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the electoral process, was widely praised for its impartiality and professionalism.\n\n### Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were some anomalies related to postal ballots in certain constituencies, which were the subject of controversy and debate. However, these anomalies did not appear to have had a significant impact on the overall outcome of the election.\n\n### International responses\n\nThe international community responded to the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election with a mixture of concern and congratulatory messages. The European Union's European Parliament condemned the election as \"not free and fair,\" while the Council of Europe's Secretary General expressed concern about the lack of transparency and impartiality in the electoral process. However, the United States Embassy in Hungary praised the election as \"a testament to Hungary's democratic traditions.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
