{"title": "Tulsa_race_massacre", "content": "\nBackground\nIn 1921, Oklahoma had a racially, socially, and politically tense atmosphere The territory of northern Oklahoma had been established for the forced resettlement of Native Americans from the southeast, some of whom had owned slaves [35] The slaves were the first black inhabitants of Indian Territory, having been brought in by their native owners [36] Other areas had received many settlers from the South whose families had been slaveholders before the Civil War Oklahoma was admitted as a state on November 16, 1907 The newly created state legislature, which had a large Democratic majority, passed racial segregation laws, commonly known as Jim Crow laws, as its first order of business The 1907 Oklahoma Constitution did not call for strict segregation; delegates feared that U.S President Theodore Roosevelt would veto the document if they included such restrictions Still, the first law passed by the new legislature segregated all rail travel, and voter registration rules effectively disenfranchised non-whites This meant that they were also barred from either serving on juries or serving in local public offices These laws were enforced until they were ruled unconstitutional after the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 Major cities passed laws that imposed additional restrictions [37]\n\n\nMonday, May 30 (Memorial Day)\nOn May 30, 1921, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner who was employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator in the nearby Drexel Building at 319 South Main Street in order to use the top-floor \"colored\" restroom, which his employer had arranged for use by his black employees There, he encountered Sarah Page, the 21-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty Whether—and to what extent—Rowland and Page knew each other has long been a matter of speculation The two likely knew each other at least by sight because Rowland would have regularly ridden in Page's elevator on his way to and from the restroom A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what sounded like a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in a distraught state Thinking that she had been sexually assaulted, he summoned the authorities Apart from the clerk's interpretation that Rowland had attempted to rape Page, many explanations have been given for the incident, with the most common explanation being that Rowland tripped as he got onto the elevator, and as he tried to catch his fall, he grabbed onto the arm of Page, who then screamed Others suggested that Rowland and Page had a lover's quarrel [46]\n\n\nEncounter in the elevator\nOn May 30, 1921, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner who was employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator in the nearby Drexel Building at 319 South Main Street in order to use the

he grabbed onto the arm of Page, who then screamed Others suggested that Rowland and Page had a lover's quarrel [46]\n\n\nBrief investigation\nAlthough the police questioned Page, no written account of her statement has been found, but apparently, she told the police that Rowland had grabbed her arm and nothing more, and would not press charges [47] The police determined that what happened between the two individuals was less than an assault They conducted a low-key investigation rather than launching a man-hunt for her alleged assailant [48]\n\n\nTuesday, May 31\nOn the morning after the incident, Henry Carmichael, a white detective, and Henry C Pack, a black patrolman, located Rowland on Greenwood Avenue and detained him Rowland was initially taken to the Tulsa city jail at the corner of First Street and Main Street Late that day, Police Commissioner J M Adkison said he had received an anonymous telephone call threatening Rowland's life He ordered Rowland transferred to the more secure jail on the top floor of the Tulsa County Courthouse [50] [51]\n\n\nArrest of Rowland\nOn the morning after the incident, Henry Carmichael, a white detective, and Henry C Pack, a black patrolman, located Rowland on Greenwood Avenue and detained him Rowland was initially taken to the Tulsa city jail at the corner of First Street and Main Street Late that day, Police Commissioner J M Adkison said he had received an anonymous telephone call threatening Rowland's life He ordered Rowland transferred to the more secure jail on the top floor of the Tulsa County Courthouse [50] [51]\n\n\nNewspaper coverage\nThe Tulsa Tribune, owned, published, and edited by Richard Lloyd Jones, and one of two white-owned papers that were published in Tulsa, broke the story in that afternoon's edition with the headline: \"Nab Negro for Attacking Girl In an Elevator\", describing the alleged incident According to some witnesses, the same edition of the Tribune included an editorial warning of a potential lynching of Rowland, titled \"To Lynch Negro Tonight\" [53] The paper was known at the time to have a \"sensationalist\" style of news writing Allegedly, all original copies of that issue of the paper have apparently been destroyed, and the relevant page is missing from the microfilm copy [54] The Tulsa Race Riot Commission in 1997 offered a reward for a copy of the editorial, which went unclaimed [54] A copy of the Tulsa Tribune of 1 June 1921 was found: on the front page was an article headlined \"Nab Negro for attacking girl in an Elevator\"  [right] [55] The editorial page was also found: it did not have an article headlined \"To Lynch A Negro Tonight\" [55] Other newspapers of the time like The Black Dispatch and the Tulsa World did not call attention to any such editorial after the event [54] So, the exact content of the column—and whether or not it existed at all—remains in dispute [54] [56] [57] [58] However, Chief of Detectives James Patton attributed the cause of the riots entirely to the newspaper account and stated, \"If the facts in the story as told the police had only been printed I do not think there would have been any riot whatsoever.\" [47]\n\n\nStand-off at the courthouse\nThe afternoon edition of the Tribune hit the streets shortly after 3 p.m., and soon, news spread of a potential lynching By 4 p.m., local authorities were on alert White residents began congregating at and near the Tulsa County Courthouse By sunset, around 7:30 p.m., the several hundred white residents assembled outside the courthouse appeared to have the makings of a lynch mob Willard M McCullough, the newly elected sheriff of Tulsa County, was determined to avoid events such as the 1920 lynching of white murder suspect Roy Belton in Tulsa, which had occurred during the term of his predecessor [12] The sheriff took steps to ensure Rowland's safety McCullough organized his deputies into a defensive formation around Rowland, who was terrified [failed verification] The Guthrie Daily Leader reported that Rowland had been taken to the county jail before crowds started to gather [59] The sheriff positioned six of his men, armed with rifles and shotguns, on the roof of the courthouse He disabled the building's elevator and had his remaining men barricade themselves at the top of the stairs with orders to shoot any intruders in sight The sheriff went outside and tried to talk the crowd into going home, but to no avail According to an account by Scott Ellsworth, the sheriff was \"hooted down\" [60] At about 8:20 p.m., three white men entered the courthouse, demanding that Rowland be turned over to them Although vastly outnumbered by the growing crowd out on the street, Sheriff McCullough turned the men away [61]\n\n\nTaking up arms\nHaving seen the armed black men, some of the more than 1,000 whites who had been at the courthouse went home for their own guns Others headed for the National Guard armory at the corner of Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to arm themselves The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry Regiment learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he consequently took measures to prevent it He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to put on their uniforms and report quickly to the armory When a group of whites arrived and began pulling at the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300 to 400 men Bell told them that the Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory [63]\n\n\nOutbursts of violence\nThe gunshots triggered an almost immediate response, with both sides firing on each other The first \"battle\" was said to last a few seconds or so, but it took a toll, because ten whites and two black men lay dead or dying in the street [12] The black men who had offered to provide security retreated toward Greenwood A rolling gunfight ensued The armed white mob pursued the black contingent toward Greenwood, with many stopping to loot local stores for additional weapons and ammunition Along the way, bystanders, many of whom were leaving a movie theater after a show, were caught off guard by the mobs and fled Panic set in as the white mob began firing on any black people in the crowd The white mob also shot and killed at least one white man in the confusion [67] According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, some in the mob were deputized by a police officer and instructed to \"get a gun and get a nigger\" [16] So began a major attack on the African-American community [14] [13]\n\n\nWednesday, June 1\nThroughout the early morning hours, groups of armed white and black men squared off in gunfights The fighting was concentrated along sections of the Frisco tracks, a dividing line between the black and white commercial districts A rumor circulated that more black people were coming by train from Muskogee to help with an invasion of Tulsa At one point, passengers on an incoming train were forced to take cover on the floor of the train cars, as they had arrived amid crossfire, with the train taking hits on both sides Small groups of whites made brief forays by car into Greenwood, indiscriminately firing into businesses and residences They often received return fire Meanwhile, white rioters threw lighted oil rags into several buildings along Archer Street, igniting them [69]\n\n\nFires begin\nAt around 1 a.m., the white mob began setting fires, mainly in businesses on commercial Archer Street at the southern edge of the Greenwood district As news traveled among Greenwood residents in the early morning hours, many began to take up arms in defense of their neighborhood, while others began a mass exodus from the city [71] Throughout the night both sides continued fighting, sometimes only sporadically.\n\n\nDaybreak\nUpon sunrise, around 5 a.m., a train whistle sounded (Hirsch said it was a siren) Some rioters believed this sound to be a signal for the rioters to launch an all-out assault on Greenwood A white man stepped out from behind the Frisco depot and was fatally shot by a sniper in Greenwood Crowds of rioters poured from their shelter, on foot, and by car, into the streets of the neighborhood Five white men in a car led the charge but were killed by a fusillade of gunfire before they had traveled one block [79]\n\n\nAttack by air\nNumerous eyewitnesses described airplanes carrying white assailants, who fired rifles and dropped firebombs on buildings, homes, and fleeing families The privately owned aircraft had been dispatched from the nearby Curtiss-Southwest Field outside Tulsa [26] Law enforcement officials later said that the planes were to provide reconnaissance and protect against a \"Negro uprising\" [26] Law enforcement personnel were thought to be aboard at least some flights [82] Eyewitness accounts, such as testimony from the survivors during Commission hearings and a manuscript by eyewitness and attorney Buck Colbert Franklin, discovered in 2015, said that on the morning of June 1, at least \"a dozen or more\" planes circled the neighborhood and dropped \"burning turpentine balls\" on an office building, a hotel, a filling (gas) station, and multiple other buildings Men also fired rifles at black residents, gunning them down in the street [83] [26]\n\n\nArrival of National Guard troops\nAdjutant General Charles F Barrett of the Oklahoma National Guard arrived by special train at about 9:15 a.m., with 109 troops from Oklahoma City Ordered in by the governor, he could not legally act until he had contacted all the appropriate local authorities, including Mayor T D Evans, the sheriff, and the police chief Meanwhile, his troops paused to eat breakfast Barrett summoned reinforcements from several other Oklahoma cities Barrett declared martial law at 11:49 a.m., [81] and by noon the troops had managed to suppress most of the remaining violence.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe massacre was covered by national newspapers, and the reported number of deaths varies widely On June 1, 1921, the Tulsa Tribune reported that nine white people and 68 black people had died in the riot, but shortly afterwards it changed that number to a total of 176 dead The next day, the same paper reported the count as nine white people and 21 black people The Los Angeles Express headline said \"175 Killed, Many Wounded\" [97] The New York Times said that 77 people had been killed, including 68 black people, but it later lowered the total to 33 The Richmond Times Dispatch of Virginia reported that 85 people (including 25 white people) were killed; it also reported that the police chief had reported to Governor Robertson that the total was 75; and that a police major put the figure at 175 [98] The Oklahoma Department of Vital Statistics put the number of deaths at 36 (26 black and 10 white) [99] Very few people, if any, died as a direct result of the fire Official state records show five deaths by conflagration for the entire state in 1921 [100] [original research?]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe massacre was covered by national newspapers, and the reported

district The Red Cross reported that 1,256 houses were burned and another 215 were looted but not burned [111] The Tulsa Real Estate Exchange estimated property losses amounted to US$1.5 million in real estate and $750,000 in personal property [112] (equivalent to a total of $38 million in 2023).\n\n\nIdentities of the African American victims\nOn June 3, the Morning Tulsa Daily World reported major points of their interview with Deputy Sheriff Barney Cleaver concerning the events leading up to the Tulsa riot Cleaver was a deputy sheriff for Okmulgee County and not under the supervision of the city police department; his duties mainly involved enforcing the law among the \"colored people\" of Greenwood, but he also operated a business as a private investigator He had previously been dismissed as a city police investigator for assisting county officers with a drug raid at Gurley's Hotel but not reporting his involvement to his superiors [115] He had considerable land holdings and suffered tremendous financial damages as a result of the riot Among his holdings were several residential properties and Cleaver Hall, a large community gathering place and function hall He reported personally evicting a number of armed criminals who had taken to barricading themselves within properties he owned Upon eviction, they merely moved to Cleaver Hall Cleaver reported that the majority of violence started at Cleaver Hall along with the rioters barricaded inside Charles Page offered to build him a new home [6]\n\n\nPublic Safety Committee\nBy June 6, the Associated Press reported that a citizens' Public Safety Committee had been established, made up of 250 white men who vowed to protect the city and put down any more disturbance A white man was shot and killed that day after he failed to stop as ordered by a National Guardsman [116]\n\n\nRebuilding\nGovernor James B A Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8 The jury was selected by June 9 Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot [117]\n\n\nTulsa Union Depot\nDespite the Red Cross's best efforts to assist with the reconstruction of Greenwood's residential area, the considerably altered present-day layout of the district and its surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the extensive redevelopment of Greenwood by people unaffiliated with the neighborhood prior to the riot, stand as proof that the Red Cross relief efforts had limited success [121]\n\n\n1921 grand jury investigation\nThe Tulsa Police Department, in the words of Chief Chuck Jordan, \"did not do their job then, y'know, they just didn't\" [126] Parrish, an African-American citizen of Tulsa, summarized the lawlessness in Oklahoma as a contributing factor in 1922 as, \"if .. it were not for the profitable alliance of politics and vice or professional crime, the tiny spark which is the beginning of all these outrages would be promptly extinguished.\" [127] Clark, a prominent Oklahoma historian and law professor, completed his doctoral dissertation in law on the subject of lawlessness in Oklahoma specifically on this period of time and how lawlessness had led to the rise of the second KKK, in order to illustrate the need for effective law enforcement and a functional judiciary [128]\n\n\nAllegations of corruption\nThe Tulsa Police Department, in the words of Chief Chuck Jordan, \"did not do their job then, y'know, they just didn't\" [126] Parrish, an

enforcement and a functional judiciary [128]\n\n\nJohn A. Gustafson\nChief of Police John A Gustafson was the subject of an investigation Official proceedings began on June 6, 1921 He was prosecuted on multiple counts: refusing to enforce prohibition, refusing to enforce anti-prostitution laws; operating a stolen automobile-laundering racket and allowing known automobile thieves to escape justice, for the purpose of extorting the citizens of Tulsa for rewards relating to their return; repurposing vehicles for his own use or sale; operating a fake detective agency for the purpose of billing the city of Tulsa for investigative duties he was already being paid for as chief of police; failing to enforce gun laws; and failure to take action during the riots [129]\n\n\nBreaking the silence\nThree days after the massacre, President Warren G Harding spoke at the all-black Lincoln University in Pennsylvania He declared, \"Despite the demagogues, the idea of our oneness as Americans has risen superior to every appeal to mere class and group And so, I wish it might be in this matter of our national problem of races.\" Speaking directly about the events in Tulsa, he said, \"God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness, and the justice of this country, we never see another spectacle like it.\" [136]\n\n\nSurvivors\nThe Tulsa massacre claimed an estimated 150–300 lives; over 800 people were seriously injured, and many more are estimated to have had their lives drastically changed forever [149]\n\n\nOlivia Hooker\nOlivia Hooker was born on February 12, 1915, in Muskogee, Oklahoma Her family was one of the many families affected by the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 when she was only six years old Her family's home in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma was broken into by a group of white men with torches and was torn apart Many of her family's belongings were destroyed One item that Hooker recalled was her sister's piano She remembered hearing a group of white men whacking into the piano as she and her four other siblings hid under the dining room table, which their mother covered with a tablecloth Her father owned a store in Tulsa, which she recalled was absolutely destroyed and only one safe was left standing The only reason it was left standing was that it was too big and heavy to be destroyed or stolen Hooker also remembered vividly her schoolhouse being destroyed and blown up with dynamite After the massacre, Hooker and her family moved to Topeka, Kansas to rebuild their lives Hooker recalled her mother telling her, \"don't spend your time agonizing over the past.\" With a new fresh start in Topeka, Kansas, Hooker was the first African American woman to join the Coast Guard (in February 1945) [150] [151] After leaving the Coast Guard, Hooker went on to earn her Master's degree in psychology from Teacher's College, Columbia University She earned her doctorate in clinical psychology at the University of Rochester [152] Hooker went on to have multiple jobs with her degree in psychology, mostly basing her work on the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 Olivia Hooker retired from work at the age of 87 She died at the age of 103 on November 21, 2018 in her home in New York.\n\n\nEldoris McCondichie\nEldoris McCondichie was born on September 1, 1911, in Tyler, Texas She was four years old when she and her family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the Greenwood district Her family was part of the working class Her father had worked in a field and her mother did housework On May 31, 1921, McCondichie was nine years old She remembered being frantically awakened by her mother She remembered her mother saying, \"the white people are killing the colored people.\" McCondichie and her family evacuated their Tulsa home to find refuge up north from the massacre McCondichie described how \"airplanes were raining down bullets\", and how no one had enough time to even put clothes on and evacuate their homes She recalled seeing women walking on the railroad track with no shoes in their nightgowns She remembered finding shelter in a chicken coop during the riots to protect herself from machine gun fire After McCondichie and her family evacuated Tulsa, they found refuge in a farmer's home overnight Her family traveled to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, where they stayed for about 2–3 days until they knew it was safe to return home Upon returning to Tulsa, Eldoris described what was left of the Greenwood district as \"war-torn\" She recalled many businesses and homes were burnt to the ground Her family slowly rebuilt their lives in Tulsa and never left, referring to it as their \"forever home\" [153] Eldoris was married to Arthur McCodichie for 67 years and had four children;

grateful he was for the woman's kindness When his family returned to their home, it was burnt to the ground They had to rebuild their whole lives again from scratch However, they stayed in Tulsa in the Greenwood district all through his childhood [162] As a young boy, Singer hung out by the rail tracks and invited jazz bands to come over and have some of his mother's cooking This helped him in

better known as \"Peg Leg\" Taylor According to Taylor's great-granddaughter, who has passed on Eloise's story, Eloise witnessed some of the first gunfighting of the Massacre She recounts how Peg Leg Taylor \"fought his way to\" Eloise and helped her escape into the woods north of the city, where they then lay and hid while White rioters continued to hunt down and kill other survivors around them \"...they found some of the people that were out there in the woods laying on their stomach—Lord help these people!—and they just shot 'em Right there on the ground where they lay I'm talking about kids...women They didn't care Old people People who had breastfed them They didn't give a damn They killed 'em right there on the ground...\" Eloise was reportedly so terrified that when \"...finally her daddy told her to 'get up...get up and c'mon,' she said  [in order] for them to move, he had to hurt her She said he had to hurt her to make her stand up.\" Eloise and her father then walked several miles to a nearby town, where they \"got help, got warm, got clothes, got food, and moved on\", and where they also \"decided that they would never talk about it again\" Eloise finally opened up to her great-granddaughters about her experience in 1997, only a few short years before she died in 2000 at the age of 98 [27]\n\n\nTulsa Race Massacre Commission\nIn 1996, as the riot's 75th anniversary neared, the state legislature authorized an Oklahoma Commission to investigate the Tulsa Race Riot, by appointing individuals to study and prepare a report detailing a historical account of the riot Authorization of the study \"enjoyed strong support from members of both political parties and all political persuasions\" [167] The commission had originally been called the \"Tulsa Race Riot Commission\", but in November 2018, the name was changed to \"Tulsa Race Massacre Commission\" [168] The commission conducted interviews and heard testimony in order to thoroughly document the causes and damages.\n\n\nPost-commission actions\nThe Tulsa Race Massacre Commission arranged for archaeological, non-invasive ground surveys of Newblock Park, Oaklawn Cemetery, and Booker T Washington Cemetery, which were identified as possible locations for mass graves of black victims of the violence Oral histories, other sources and timing suggested that whites would have buried blacks at the first two locations; black people were said to have buried black victims at the third location after the riot was over The people who were buried at Washington Cemetery, which is reserved for black people, were probably thought to be those victims who had died of their wounds after the riot had ended, since it was the most distant suspected burial location from downtown.\n\n\nSearch for mass graves\nThe Tulsa Race Massacre Commission arranged for archaeological, non-invasive ground surveys of Newblock Park, Oaklawn Cemetery, and Booker T Washington Cemetery, which were identified as possible locations for mass graves of black victims of the violence Oral histories, other sources and timing suggested that whites would have buried blacks at the first two locations; black people were said to have buried black victims at the third location after the riot was over The people who were buried at Washington Cemetery, which is reserved for black people, were probably thought to be those victims who had died of their wounds after the riot had ended, since it was the most distant suspected burial location from downtown.\n\n\nReconciliation\nIn March 2001, each of the 118 known survivors of the riot still alive at the time, the youngest of whom was 85, was given a gold-plated medal bearing the state seal, as had been approved by bi-partisan state leaders [188] The Tulsa Reparations Coalition, sponsored by the Center for Racial Justice, Inc., was formed on April 7, 2001, to obtain restitution for the damages suffered by Tulsa's black community, as recommended by the Oklahoma Commission [189]\n\n\nSurvivors' lawsuit\nFive survivors, represented by a legal team that included Johnnie Cochran and Charles Ogletree, filed suit against the city of Tulsa and the state of Oklahoma (Alexander, et al v Oklahoma, et al.) in February 2003, based on the findings of the 2001 report Ogletree said the state and city should compensate the victims and their families \"to honor their admitted obligations as detailed in the commission's report\" [193] The federal district and appellate courts dismissed the suit on the grounds that a recommendation was not an \"admitted obligation\" and noting the statute of limitations had been exceeded on the 80-year-old case [194] The state requires that civil rights cases be filed within two years of the event For that reason, the court did not rule on the issues The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the appeal.\n\n\nJohn Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park\nA park was developed in 2010 in the Greenwood area as a memorial to victims of the riot In October 2010, the park was named for noted historian John Hope Franklin, who was born and raised in Tulsa [196] He became known as a historian of the South The park includes three statues of figures by sculptor Ed Dwight, representing Hostility, Humiliation and Hope [197]\n\n\nRenewed calls for restitution\nAn extensive curriculum on the event was provided to Oklahoma school districts in 2020 [198]\n\n\nPresident Biden's 2021 visit\nOn June 1, 2021, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, President Joe Biden visited the area, the first sitting president to do so, and during his visit, he made a speech in which he stated, \"Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try.\" [209] Biden toured the Greenwood Cultural Center and met with survivors Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis, and Lessie Benningfield Randle [210]\n\n\nTulsa Historical Society and Museum\nThe Tulsa Historical Society and Museum offer a virtual exhibit of the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 that is open at all times during the day and is free of charge to the public This online exhibit offers many photos, audio recordings, documents, and resources that cannot be found anywhere else [211] It also offers a traveling exhibit consisting of 4 panels regarding the Tulsa Race Massacre that are allowed to travel to locations within the Tulsa Metropolitan Area The main goal of the panels is to educate the community [212]\n\n\nPresent-day Black Wall Street\nBlack Wall Street can still be found today under the Historical Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma After the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, it took about 10 years to rebuild the district The historical Vernon AME Church is the only building standing today that is a part of the last remaining structure of the 1921 massacre [213]\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nFilm and television\n\n\nMusic and

\"Tulsa_race_massacre\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nIn 1921, Oklahoma had a racially, socially, and politically tense atmosphere The territory of northern Oklahoma had been established for the forced resettlement of Native Americans from the southeast, some of whom had owned slaves [35] The slaves were the first black inhabitants of Indian Territory, having been brought in by their native owners [36] Other areas had received many settlers from the South whose families had been slaveholders before the Civil War Oklahoma was admitted as a state on November 16, 1907 The newly created state legislature, which had a large Democratic majority, passed racial segregation laws, commonly known as Jim Crow laws, as its first order of business The 1907 Oklahoma Constitution did not call for strict segregation; delegates feared that U.S President Theodore Roosevelt would veto the document if they included such restrictions Still, the first law passed by the new legislature segregated all rail travel, and voter registration rules effectively disenfranchised non-whites This meant that they were also barred from either serving on juries or serving in local public offices These laws were enforced until they were ruled unconstitutional after the passage of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 Major cities passed laws that imposed additional restrictions [37]\n\n\nMonday, May 30 (Memorial Day)\nOn May 30, 1921, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner who was employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator in the nearby Drexel Building at 319 South Main Street in order to use the top-floor \"colored\" restroom, which his employer had arranged for use by his black employees There, he encountered Sarah Page, the 21-year-old white elevator operator who was on duty Whether—and to what extent—Rowland and Page knew each other has long been a matter of speculation The two likely knew each other at least by sight because Rowland would have regularly ridden in Page's elevator on his way to and from the restroom A clerk at Renberg's, a clothing store on the first floor of the Drexel, heard what sounded like a woman's scream and saw a young black man rushing from the building The clerk went to the elevator and found Page in a distraught state Thinking that she had been sexually assaulted, he summoned the authorities Apart from the clerk's interpretation that Rowland had attempted to rape Page, many explanations have been given for the incident, with the most common explanation being that Rowland tripped as he got onto the elevator, and as he tried to catch his fall, he grabbed onto the arm of Page, who then screamed Others suggested that Rowland and Page had a lover's quarrel [46]\n\n\nEncounter in the elevator\nOn May 30, 1921, 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a black shoeshiner who was employed at a Main Street shine parlor, entered the only elevator in the nearby Drexel Building at 319 South Main Street in order to use the top-floor \"colored\" restroom, which his employer had arranged for use by his black employees There, he encountered Sarah Page, the 21-year-old

tripped as he got onto the elevator, and as he tried to catch his fall, he grabbed onto the arm of Page, who then screamed Others suggested that Rowland and Page had a lover's quarrel [46]\n\n\nBrief investigation\nAlthough the police questioned Page, no written account of her statement has been found, but apparently, she told the police that Rowland had grabbed her arm and nothing more, and would not press charges [47] The police determined that what happened between the two individuals was less than an assault They conducted a low-key investigation rather than launching a man-hunt for her alleged assailant [48]\n\n\nTuesday, May 31\nOn the morning after the incident, Henry Carmichael, a white detective, and Henry C Pack, a black patrolman, located Rowland on Greenwood Avenue and detained him Rowland was initially taken to the Tulsa city jail at the corner of First Street and Main Street Late that day, Police Commissioner J M Adkison said he had received an anonymous telephone call threatening Rowland's life He ordered Rowland transferred to the more secure jail on the top floor of the Tulsa County Courthouse [50] [51]\n\n\nArrest of Rowland\nOn the morning after the incident, Henry Carmichael, a white detective, and Henry C Pack, a black patrolman, located Rowland on Greenwood Avenue and detained him Rowland was initially taken to the Tulsa city jail at the corner of First Street and Main Street Late that day, Police Commissioner J M Adkison said he had received an anonymous telephone call threatening Rowland's life He ordered Rowland transferred to the more secure jail on the top floor of the Tulsa County Courthouse [50] [51]\n\n\nNewspaper coverage\nThe Tulsa Tribune, owned, published, and edited by Richard Lloyd Jones, and one of two white-owned papers that were published in Tulsa, broke the story in that afternoon's edition with the headline: \"Nab Negro for Attacking Girl In an Elevator\", describing the alleged incident According to some witnesses, the same edition of the Tribune included an editorial warning of a potential lynching of Rowland, titled \"To Lynch Negro Tonight\" [53] The paper was known at the time to have a \"sensationalist\" style of news writing Allegedly, all original copies of that issue of the paper have apparently been destroyed, and the relevant page is missing from the microfilm copy [54] The Tulsa Race Riot Commission in 1997 offered a reward for a copy of the editorial, which went unclaimed [54] A copy of the Tulsa Tribune of 1 June 1921 was found: on the front page was an article headlined \"Nab Negro for attacking girl in an Elevator\"  [right] [55] The editorial page was also found: it did not have an article headlined \"To Lynch A Negro Tonight\" [55] Other newspapers of the time like The Black Dispatch and the Tulsa World did not call attention to any such editorial after the event [54] So, the exact content of the column—and whether or not it existed at all—remains in dispute [54] [56] [57] [58] However, Chief of Detectives James Patton attributed the cause of the riots entirely to the newspaper account and stated, \"If the facts in the story as told the police had only been printed I do not think there would have been any riot whatsoever.\" [47]\n\n\nStand-off at the courthouse\nThe afternoon edition of the Tribune hit the streets shortly after 3 p.m., and soon, news spread of a potential lynching By 4 p.m., local authorities were on alert White residents began congregating at and near the Tulsa County Courthouse By sunset, around 7:30 p.m., the several hundred white residents assembled outside the courthouse appeared to have the makings of a lynch mob Willard M McCullough, the newly elected sheriff of Tulsa County, was determined to avoid events such as the 1920 lynching of white murder suspect Roy Belton in Tulsa, which had occurred during the term of his predecessor [12] The sheriff took steps to ensure Rowland's safety McCullough organized his deputies into a defensive formation around Rowland, who was terrified [failed verification] The Guthrie Daily Leader reported that Rowland had been taken to the county jail before crowds started to gather [59] The sheriff positioned six of his men, armed with rifles and shotguns, on the roof of the courthouse He disabled the building's elevator and had his remaining men barricade themselves at the top of the stairs with orders to shoot any intruders in sight The sheriff went outside and tried to talk the crowd into going home, but to no avail According to an account by Scott Ellsworth, the sheriff was \"hooted down\" [60] At about 8:20 p.m., three white men entered the courthouse, demanding that Rowland be turned over to them Although vastly outnumbered by the growing crowd out on the street, Sheriff McCullough turned the men away [61]\n\n\nTaking up arms\nHaving seen the armed black men, some of the more than 1,000 whites who had been at the courthouse went home for their own guns Others headed for the National Guard armory at the corner of Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to arm themselves The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry Regiment learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he consequently took measures to prevent it He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to put on their uniforms and report quickly to the armory When a group of whites arrived and began pulling at the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300 to 400 men Bell told them that the Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory [63]\n\n\nOutbursts of violence\nThe gunshots triggered an almost immediate response, with both sides firing on each other The first \"battle\" was said to last a few seconds or so, but it took a toll, because ten whites and two black men lay dead or dying in the street [12] The black men who had offered to provide security retreated toward Greenwood A rolling gunfight ensued The armed white mob pursued the black contingent toward Greenwood, with many stopping to loot local stores for additional weapons and ammunition Along the way, bystanders, many of whom were leaving a movie theater after a show, were caught off guard by the mobs and fled Panic set in as the white mob began firing on any black people in the crowd The white mob also shot and killed at least one white man in the confusion [67] According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, some in the mob were deputized by a police officer and instructed to \"get a gun and get a nigger\" [16] So began a major attack on the African-American community [14] [13]\n\n\nWednesday, June 1\nThroughout the early morning hours, groups of armed white and black men squared off in gunfights The fighting was concentrated along sections of the Frisco tracks, a dividing line between the black and white commercial districts A rumor circulated that more black people were coming by train from Muskogee to help with an invasion of Tulsa At one point, passengers on an incoming train were forced to take cover on the floor of the train cars, as they had arrived amid crossfire, with the train taking hits on both sides Small groups of whites made brief forays by car into Greenwood, indiscriminately firing into businesses and residences They often received return fire Meanwhile, white rioters threw lighted oil rags into several buildings along Archer Street, igniting them [69]\n\n\nFires begin\nAt around 1 a.m., the white mob began setting fires, mainly in businesses on commercial Archer Street at the southern edge of the Greenwood district As news traveled among Greenwood residents in the early morning hours, many began to take up arms in defense of their neighborhood, while others began a mass exodus from the city [71] Throughout the night both sides continued fighting, sometimes only sporadically.\n\n\nDaybreak\nUpon sunrise, around 5 a.m., a train whistle sounded (Hirsch said it was a siren) Some rioters believed this sound to be a signal for the rioters to launch an all-out assault on Greenwood A white man stepped out from behind the Frisco depot and was fatally shot by a sniper in Greenwood Crowds of rioters poured from their shelter, on foot, and by car, into the streets of the neighborhood Five white men in a car led the charge but were killed by a fusillade of gunfire before they had traveled one block [79]\n\n\nAttack by air\nNumerous eyewitnesses described airplanes carrying white assailants, who fired rifles and dropped firebombs on buildings, homes, and fleeing families The privately owned aircraft had been dispatched from the nearby Curtiss-Southwest Field outside Tulsa [26] Law enforcement officials later said that the planes were to provide reconnaissance and protect against a \"Negro uprising\" [26] Law enforcement personnel were thought to be aboard at least some flights [82] Eyewitness accounts, such as testimony from the survivors during Commission hearings and a manuscript by eyewitness and attorney Buck Colbert Franklin, discovered in 2015, said that on the morning of June 1, at least \"a dozen or more\" planes circled the neighborhood and dropped \"burning turpentine balls\" on an office building, a hotel, a filling (gas) station, and multiple other buildings Men also fired rifles at black residents, gunning them down in the street [83] [26]\n\n\nArrival of National Guard troops\nAdjutant General Charles F Barrett of the Oklahoma National Guard arrived by special train at about 9:15 a.m., with 109 troops from Oklahoma City Ordered in by the governor, he could not legally act until he had contacted all the appropriate local authorities, including Mayor T D Evans, the sheriff, and the police chief Meanwhile, his troops paused to eat breakfast Barrett summoned reinforcements from several other Oklahoma cities Barrett declared martial law at 11:49 a.m., [81] and by noon the troops had managed to suppress most of the remaining violence.\n\n\nAftermath\nThe massacre was covered by national newspapers, and the reported number of deaths varies widely On June 1, 1921, the Tulsa Tribune reported that nine white people and 68 black people had died in the riot, but shortly afterwards it changed that number to a total of 176 dead The next day, the same paper reported the count as nine white people and 21 black people The Los Angeles Express headline said \"175 Killed, Many Wounded\" [97] The New York Times said that 77 people had been killed, including 68 black people, but it later lowered the total to 33 The Richmond Times Dispatch of Virginia reported that 85 people (including 25 white people) were killed; it also reported that the police chief had reported to Governor Robertson that the total was 75; and that a police major put the figure at 175 [98] The Oklahoma Department of Vital Statistics put the number of deaths at 36 (26 black and 10 white) [99] Very few people, if any, died as a direct result of the fire Official state records show five deaths by conflagration for the entire state in 1921 [100] [original research?]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe massacre was covered by national newspapers,

the only hospital in the district The Red Cross reported that 1,256 houses were burned and another 215 were looted but not burned [111] The Tulsa Real Estate Exchange estimated property losses amounted to US$1.5 million in real estate and $750,000 in personal property [112] (equivalent to a total of $38 million in 2023).\n\n\nIdentities of the African American victims\nOn June 3, the Morning Tulsa Daily World reported major points of their interview with Deputy Sheriff Barney Cleaver concerning the events leading up to the Tulsa riot Cleaver was a deputy sheriff for Okmulgee County and not under the supervision of the city police department; his duties mainly involved enforcing the law among the \"colored people\" of Greenwood, but he also operated a business as a private investigator He had previously been dismissed as a city police investigator for assisting county officers with a drug raid at Gurley's Hotel but not reporting his involvement to his superiors [115] He had considerable land holdings and suffered tremendous financial damages as a result of the riot Among his holdings were several residential properties and Cleaver Hall, a large community gathering place and function hall He reported personally evicting a number of armed criminals who had taken to barricading themselves within properties he owned Upon eviction, they merely moved to Cleaver Hall Cleaver reported that the majority of violence started at Cleaver Hall along with the rioters barricaded inside Charles Page offered to build him a new home [6]\n\n\nPublic Safety Committee\nBy June 6, the Associated Press reported that a citizens' Public Safety Committee had been established, made up of 250 white men who vowed to protect the city and put down any more disturbance A white man was shot and killed that day after he failed to stop as ordered by a National Guardsman [116]\n\n\nRebuilding\nGovernor James B A Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8 The jury was selected by June 9 Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot [117]\n\n\nTulsa Union Depot\nDespite the Red Cross's best efforts to assist with the reconstruction of Greenwood's residential area, the considerably altered present-day layout of the district and its surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the extensive redevelopment of Greenwood by people unaffiliated with the neighborhood prior to the riot, stand as proof that the Red Cross relief efforts had limited success [121]\n\n\n1921 grand jury investigation\nThe Tulsa Police Department, in the words of Chief Chuck Jordan, \"did not do their job then, y'know, they just didn't\" [126] Parrish, an African-American citizen of Tulsa, summarized the lawlessness in Oklahoma as a contributing factor in 1922 as, \"if .. it were not for the profitable alliance of politics and vice or professional crime, the tiny spark which is the beginning of all these outrages would be promptly extinguished.\" [127] Clark, a prominent Oklahoma historian and law professor, completed his doctoral dissertation in law on the subject of lawlessness in Oklahoma specifically on this period of time and how lawlessness had led to the rise of the second KKK, in order to illustrate the need for effective law enforcement and a functional judiciary [128]\n\n\nAllegations of corruption\nThe Tulsa Police Department, in the words of Chief Chuck Jordan, \"did not do their job then, y'know, they

Gustafson\nChief of Police John A Gustafson was the subject of an investigation Official proceedings began on June 6, 1921 He was prosecuted on multiple counts: refusing to enforce prohibition, refusing to enforce anti-prostitution laws; operating a stolen automobile-laundering racket and allowing known automobile thieves to escape justice, for the purpose of extorting the citizens of Tulsa for rewards relating to their return; repurposing vehicles for his own use or sale; operating a fake detective agency for the purpose of billing the city of Tulsa for investigative duties he was already being paid for as chief of police; failing to enforce gun laws; and failure to take action during the riots [129]\n\n\nBreaking the silence\nThree days after the massacre, President Warren G Harding spoke at the all-black Lincoln University in Pennsylvania He declared, \"Despite the demagogues, the idea of our oneness as Americans has risen superior to every appeal to mere class and group And so, I wish it might be in this matter of our national problem of races.\" Speaking directly about the events in Tulsa, he said, \"God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness, and the justice of this country, we never see another spectacle like it.\" [136]\n\n\nSurvivors\nThe Tulsa massacre claimed an estimated 150–300 lives; over 800 people were seriously injured, and many more are estimated to have had their lives drastically changed forever [149]\n\n\nOlivia Hooker\nOlivia Hooker was born on February 12, 1915, in Muskogee, Oklahoma Her family was one of the many families affected by the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 when she was only six years old Her family's home in the Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma was broken into by a group of white men with torches and was torn apart Many of her family's belongings were destroyed One item that Hooker recalled was her sister's piano She remembered hearing a group of white men whacking into the piano as she and her four other siblings hid under the dining room table, which their mother covered with a tablecloth Her father owned a store in Tulsa, which she recalled was absolutely destroyed and only one safe was left standing The only reason it was left standing was that it was too big and heavy to be destroyed or stolen Hooker also remembered vividly her schoolhouse being destroyed and blown up with dynamite After the massacre, Hooker and her family moved to Topeka, Kansas to rebuild their lives Hooker recalled her mother telling her, \"don't spend your time agonizing over the past.\" With a new fresh start in Topeka, Kansas, Hooker was the first African American woman to join the Coast Guard (in February 1945) [150] [151] After leaving the Coast Guard, Hooker went on to earn her Master's degree in psychology from Teacher's College, Columbia University She earned her doctorate in clinical psychology at the University of Rochester [152] Hooker went on to have multiple jobs with her degree in psychology, mostly basing her work on the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 Olivia Hooker retired from work at the age of 87 She died at the age of 103 on November 21, 2018 in her home in New York.\n\n\nEldoris McCondichie\nEldoris McCondichie was born on September 1, 1911, in Tyler, Texas She was four years old when she and her family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the Greenwood district Her family was part of the working class Her father had worked in a field and her mother did housework On May 31, 1921, McCondichie was nine years old She remembered being frantically awakened by her mother She remembered her mother saying, \"the white people are killing the colored people.\" McCondichie and her family evacuated their Tulsa home to find refuge up north from the massacre McCondichie described how \"airplanes were raining down bullets\", and how no one had enough time to even put clothes on and evacuate their homes She recalled seeing women walking on the railroad track with no shoes in their nightgowns She remembered finding shelter in a chicken coop during the riots to protect herself from machine gun fire After McCondichie and her family evacuated Tulsa, they found refuge in a farmer's home overnight Her family traveled to Pawhuska, Oklahoma, where they stayed for about 2–3 days until they knew it was safe to return home Upon returning to Tulsa, Eldoris described what was left of the Greenwood district as \"war-torn\" She recalled many businesses and homes were burnt to the ground Her family slowly rebuilt their lives in Tulsa and never left, referring to it as their \"forever home\" [153] Eldoris was married to Arthur McCodichie for 67 years and had four children; two sons and two daughters She died on September 12, 2010, several days after celebrating her 99th birthday Her final resting place is in the Crownhill Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma [154]\n\n\nGeorge Monroe\nGeorge Monroe was five years old during the attack on the Greenwood district [155] He claimed some images could never leave his mind He remembered seeing people getting shot and his own curtains being set on fire by a mob of white men He also recalled hiding under a bed with his older sister, when a rioter stepped on his finger, causing his sister to throw her hand over his mouth to prevent the men from hearing his screams George Monroe lived out the rest of his life in Tulsa, Oklahoma He became a musician, owner of a Tulsa nightclub, and the first black man in Tulsa to sell Coca-Cola George Monroe died in 2001 [156]\n\n\nMary E.

[157] A new edition was published in 2021 by Trinity University Press under the title, The Nation Must Awake: My Witness to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 The new edition includes a new afterword by Anneliese M Bruner, Parrish's great-granddaughter The New York Times called Parrish's \"a story of survival.. remains relevant a century later\" while The New Yorker called it \"The first and most visceral long-form account of how Greenwood residents experienced the massacre.\" [158] [159]\n\n\nLessie Benningfield (\"Mother Randle\")\nLessie Benningfield, also known as Mother Randle, was born in Morris, Oklahoma on November 10, 1914 Her parents were farmers; she had three sisters and a brother Benningfield does not recall much due to her young age during the massacre She remembers a mob of white men barging into her home and then destroying her family's house She has memories of feelings of intense fear while trying to evacuate her home and get somewhere safe with her family She spent

his mother worked, put his family on a train to Kansas City during the massacre so the Singer family would have a safe place to wait it out Up to the day of his passing, Singer recalled how forever grateful he was for the woman's kindness When his family returned to their home, it was burnt to the ground They had to rebuild their whole lives again from scratch However, they stayed in Tulsa in the Greenwood district all through his childhood [162] As a young boy, Singer hung out by the rail tracks and invited jazz bands to come over and have some of his mother's cooking This helped him in the long run as he became an iconic saxophonist of his generation Singer went on to play with and for Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, and Billie Holiday He was married for over 50 years to his wife Arlette Singer On August 18, 2020, just months before his 101st birthday, he died in Chatou, a suburb of Paris, France [163] [164]\n\n\nEssie Lee Johnson Beck\nEssie Johnson (1916–2006) was five years

the ground in her neighborhood Her mother took Beck and her four other siblings and started running to find shelter elsewhere Beck recalls watching airplanes above her dropping bombs onto the roof of houses causing them to catch on fire Her mother was trying to get her and her siblings to Golden Gate Park Beck's father stayed behind to help as much as possible and to assist injured people Beck recalls once they got to Golden Gate Park, they hid behind trees Beck and her family soon after that found shelter in churches and school basements for the remaining days Once they were cleared to go back, their home was burnt to the ground Beck recalls having to live in a tent on the dirt waiting for their house to be rebuilt She describes the whole experience to be awful [165]\n\n\nVernice Simms\nVernice Simms was seventeen years old when the Massacre took place She lived in the Greenwood district with her family as she attended Booker T Washington High School, where she was preparing for her prom Simms remembers vividly being in her backyard when bullets started raining down and everyone was cautioned to get into the house as quickly as possible As the riots and massacre progressed, Simms and her family found refuge at a white family's home, where they were safe from the massacre When they returned to their Greenwood home, everything was burnt to the ground Simms and her family had to live in a tent She recalls Booker T Washington High School being turned into a hospital for the wounded Simms volunteered at the hospital where she fed and gave water to people who were injured during the massacre While her house was being rebuilt by her father, she finished high school in Oklahoma City Afterward, Simms studied at Langston University After she graduated from university, she came home to see her house finally rebuilt She recalls never getting any money from insurance or the government to help Simms described the events as devastating and scary [166]\n\n\nLena Eloise Taylor Butler\nEloise Taylor was nineteen years old and she lived in Greenwood when the Massacre took place She was the daughter of the famed Horace Greeley Beecher Taylor, better known as \"Peg Leg\" Taylor According to Taylor's great-granddaughter, who has passed on Eloise's story, Eloise witnessed some of the first gunfighting of the Massacre She recounts how Peg Leg Taylor \"fought his way to\" Eloise and helped her escape into the woods north of the city, where they then lay and hid while White rioters continued to hunt down and kill other survivors around them \"...they found some of the people that were out there in the woods laying on their stomach—Lord help these people!—and they just shot 'em Right there on the ground where they lay I'm talking about kids...women They didn't care Old people People who had breastfed them They didn't give a damn They killed 'em right there on the ground...\" Eloise was reportedly so terrified that when \"...finally her daddy told her to 'get up...get up and c'mon,' she said  [in order] for them to move, he had to hurt her She said he had to hurt her to make her stand up.\" Eloise and her father then walked several miles to a nearby town, where they \"got help, got warm, got clothes, got food, and moved on\", and where they also \"decided that they would never talk about it again\" Eloise finally opened up to her great-granddaughters about her experience in 1997, only a few short years before she died in 2000 at the age of 98 [27]\n\n\nTulsa Race Massacre Commission\nIn 1996, as the riot's 75th anniversary neared, the state legislature authorized an Oklahoma Commission to investigate the Tulsa Race Riot, by appointing individuals to study and prepare a report detailing a historical account of the riot Authorization of the study \"enjoyed strong support from members of both political parties and all political persuasions\" [167] The commission had originally been called the \"Tulsa Race Riot Commission\", but in November 2018, the name was changed to \"Tulsa Race Massacre Commission\" [168] The commission conducted interviews and heard testimony in order to thoroughly document the causes and damages.\n\n\nPost-commission actions\nThe Tulsa Race Massacre Commission arranged for archaeological, non-invasive ground surveys of Newblock Park, Oaklawn Cemetery, and Booker T Washington Cemetery, which were identified as possible locations for mass graves of black victims of the violence Oral histories, other sources and timing suggested that whites would have buried blacks at the first two locations; black people were said to have buried black victims at the third location after the riot was over The people who were buried at Washington Cemetery, which is reserved for black people, were probably thought to be those victims who had died of their wounds after the riot had ended, since it was the most distant suspected burial location from downtown.\n\n\nSearch for mass graves\nThe Tulsa Race Massacre Commission arranged for archaeological, non-invasive ground surveys of Newblock Park, Oaklawn Cemetery, and Booker T Washington Cemetery, which were identified as possible locations for mass graves of black victims of the violence Oral histories, other sources and timing suggested that whites would have buried blacks at the first two

probably thought to be those victims who had died of their wounds after the riot had ended, since it was the most distant suspected burial location from downtown.\n\n\nReconciliation\nIn March 2001, each of the 118 known survivors of the riot still alive at the time, the youngest of whom was 85, was given a gold-plated medal bearing the state seal, as had been approved by bi-partisan state leaders [188] The Tulsa Reparations Coalition, sponsored by the Center for Racial Justice, Inc., was formed on April 7, 2001, to obtain restitution for the damages suffered by Tulsa's black community, as recommended by the Oklahoma Commission [189]\n\n\nSurvivors' lawsuit\nFive survivors, represented by a legal team that included Johnnie Cochran and Charles Ogletree, filed suit against the city of Tulsa and the state of Oklahoma (Alexander, et al v Oklahoma, et al.) in February 2003, based on the findings of the 2001 report Ogletree said the state and city should compensate the victims and their families \"to honor their admitted obligations as detailed in the commission's report\" [193] The federal district and appellate courts dismissed the suit on the grounds that a recommendation was not an \"admitted obligation\" and noting the statute of limitations had been exceeded on the 80-year-old case [194] The state requires that civil rights cases be filed within two years of the event For that reason, the court did not rule on the issues The Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the appeal.\n\n\nJohn Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park\nA park was developed in 2010 in the Greenwood area as a memorial to victims of the riot In October 2010, the park was named for noted historian John Hope Franklin, who was born and raised in Tulsa [196] He became known as a historian of the South The park includes three statues of figures by sculptor Ed Dwight, representing Hostility, Humiliation and Hope [197]\n\n\nRenewed calls for restitution\nAn extensive curriculum on the event was provided to Oklahoma school districts in 2020 [198]\n\n\nPresident Biden's 2021 visit\nOn June 1, 2021, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, President Joe Biden visited the area, the first sitting president to do so, and during his visit, he made a speech in which he stated, \"Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try.\" [209] Biden toured the Greenwood Cultural Center and met with survivors Viola Fletcher, Hughes Van Ellis, and Lessie Benningfield Randle [210]\n\n\nTulsa Historical Society and Museum\nThe Tulsa Historical Society and Museum offer a virtual exhibit of the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 that is open at all times during the day and is free of charge to the public This online exhibit offers many photos, audio recordings, documents, and resources that cannot be found anywhere else [211] It also offers a traveling exhibit consisting of 4 panels regarding the Tulsa Race Massacre that are allowed to travel to locations within the Tulsa Metropolitan Area The main goal of the panels is to educate the community [212]\n\n\nPresent-day Black Wall Street\nBlack Wall Street can still be found today under the Historical Greenwood District in Tulsa, Oklahoma After the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921, it took about 10 years to rebuild the district The historical Vernon AME Church is the only building standing today that is a part of the last remaining structure of the 1921 massacre [213]\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nFilm and television\n\n\nMusic and

[32] Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films [33]\nMore IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan's previous films To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle [26] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes [8] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet [34]\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to .. Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy.\" [35] As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora's Letter, [36] Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas [15]\n\n\nProduction design\nInterstellar features three spacecraft— the Endurance, a ranger, and a lander The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches It's really like a submarine in space Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\" [8]\n\n\nSound design\nGregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film's audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process [44] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment [45] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves [14] The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel.\" [46] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment [47]\n\n\nMusic\nHans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score [48] [49] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014 [14]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar [50] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception However, for Interstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens [8] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic [51]\n\n\nInfluences\nNolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982), [53] Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979) [54] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan, [55] who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature [56] He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\" He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production, [8] following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts' visors For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set [15] Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors [57] Clark Kent's upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest [24] Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe [15]\n\n\nScientific accuracy\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations\" [58] Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws Second, that all the wild speculations .. would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film [12] At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up [59] According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support [12]\n\n\nWormholes and black holes\nTo create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data [9] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature [63]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets [64] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character, Cooper [73] The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C., and was made available online later that month For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube [74]\n\n\nRelease\nBefore Interstellar's public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 IMAX

Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.\n\n**Influences**\n\nNolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982), Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979). Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water,\" according to Nolan, who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature. He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum.\" He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production, following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors. Clark Kent's upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest. Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.\n\n**Scientific Accuracy**\n\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations.\" Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws Second, that all the wild speculations .. would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film. At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up. According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.\n\n**Wormholes and Black Holes**\n\nTo create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data. Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets. The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character, Cooper. The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C., and was made available online later that month. For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube.\n\n**Release**\n\nBefore Interstellar's public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 IMAX theater in Manhattan, New York. Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22. On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild. The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nInterstellar was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States. It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks. It was reported that Interstellar was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent. It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.\n\n**Reception**\n\nInterstellar grossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $493 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $681 million on original release, against a production budget of $165 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated net profit to be $47 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it 20th on their list of 2014's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters.\" It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 378 critic reviews are positive, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp.\" Metacritic assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, Interstellar received nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and won Best Visual Effects.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Interstellar_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn the mid-21st century, humanity faces extinction due to widespread crop blights and dust storms Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA test pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that the Apollo missions were not fabricated During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to a ghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate into geographic coordinates These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that, 48 years earlier, a wormhole appeared near Saturn, leading to a system in another galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua Volunteers of the Lazarus expedition had previously travelled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results.\n\n\nCast\nAlso appearing are Josh Stewart as the voice of CASE; Leah Cairns as Lois, Tom's wife; Liam Dickinson as Coop, Tom's son; David Oyelowo and Collette Wolfe respectively as school principal and teacher Ms Hanley; Francis X McCarthy as farmer \"Boots\"; William Devane as Williams, another NASA member; Elyes Gabel as Cooper Station Administrator; and Jeff Hephner as Cooper Station Doctor.\n\n\nProduction\nThe premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date [8] [9] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans\", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing [10] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne Obst was attached to produce [11] [12] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay [13]\n\n\nCrew\nThe premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date [8] [9] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans\", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing [10] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne Obst was attached to produce [11] [12] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay [13]\n\n\nDevelopment and financing\nThe premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date [8] [9] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans\", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing [10] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne Obst was attached to produce [11] [12] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay [13]\n\n\nWriting and casting\nJonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years [8] To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology [23] He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009) Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\" [14]\n\n\nPrincipal photography\nNolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography [31] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014); [32] Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films [33]\nMore IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan's previous films To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle [26] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes [8] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet [34]\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to .. Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy.\" [35] As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora's Letter, [36] Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas [15]\n\n\nProduction design\nInterstellar features three spacecraft— the Endurance, a ranger, and a lander The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches It's really like a submarine in space Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\" [8]\n\n\nSound design\nGregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film's audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process [44] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment [45] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves [14] The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel.\" [46] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment [47]\n\n\nMusic\nHans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score [48] [49] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014 [14]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar [50] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception However, for Interstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens [8] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic [51]\n\n\nInfluences\nNolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis

The index provides a detailed list of book reviews, allowing readers to access reviews of specific titles and authors. The Book Review Index has a long history, dating back to 1965, and has undergone several changes in its publication schedule over the years.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe first volume of the Book Review Index was published in 1965. Initially, the index was published monthly, providing readers with a regular update on book reviews. However, in May 1977, the publication schedule was changed to bi-monthly. This change allowed for more comprehensive coverage of book reviews, as the index was now published more frequently.\n\nIn 1994, the Book Review Index underwent another change, becoming a quarterly publication. This change provided readers with a more in-depth look at book reviews, as the index was now published less frequently. However, the change also meant that readers had to wait longer for updates on book reviews.\n\nSince 1996, the Book Review Index has been published three times a year, along with an annual accumulation. This change has provided readers with a more regular update on book reviews, while also allowing for a comprehensive look at the previous year's reviews.\n\n**Online**\n\nThe Book Review Index is not only available in print but also online. The entire index of more than 5.6 million reviews covering over 2.5 million titles is available as Book Review Index Online or Book Review Index Plus. This online version provides readers with access to the full electronic text of more than 600,000 discussions.\n\nThe online version of the Book Review Index offers several benefits to readers. Firstly, it provides immediate access to book reviews, allowing readers to search and find reviews quickly and easily. Secondly, it allows readers to access reviews from anywhere, at any time, as long as they have an internet connection.\n\nThe online version of the Book Review Index also provides readers with advanced search features, allowing them to search by author, title, keyword, and more.

team.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBorn on 12 July 2000 in São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Vinícius Júnior began his footballing career at Flamengo, where he was signed at the age of 16. He moved to Real Madrid in 2017 and has since become a key player for the club, winning numerous titles, including the La Liga and Champions League. Vinícius is known for his speed, skill, and goal-scoring ability, earning him a reputation as one of the most promising young players in the world.\n\n**Club career**\n\nVinícius Júnior's footballing career began in 2006, when his father took him to the branch offices of Flamengo, in the neighborhood of Mutuá, in São Gonçalo where he lived. His club document described him as a left-back. Vinícius debuted for Flamengo on 13 May 2017 as an 82nd-minute substitute in a Brazilian Série A 1–1 draw against Atlético Mineiro. Two days later he extended his contract with the club from 2019 until 2022, with a significant salary increase and a buyout clause increase from €30 million to €45 million.

With a background in history and fashion design, Gauri has successfully navigated the Indian film industry, producing numerous blockbuster films and establishing herself as a respected figure in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGauri Chhibber was born on February 8, 1963, in Delhi to Savita and Colonel Ramesh Chandra Chhibber, a military officer who hailed from Hoshiarpur. She was raised in the suburbs of Panchsheel Park, Delhi, in a traditional Punjabi household. Gauri's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and cultural values. She completed her schooling at Loreto Convent School and later pursued her high school education at Modern School Vasant Vihar, New Delhi.

This exposure to the fashion industry would later influence her decision to venture into film production.\n\n**Career**\n\nGauri Khan's entry into the film industry was facilitated by her marriage to Shah Rukh Khan in 1991. The couple established Dreamz Unlimited in 1999, a film production and distribution company that aimed to produce high-quality films for the Indian market. However, the company ceased operations in 2001 due to financial constraints.

Her production company, Red Chillies Entertainment, has produced a wide range of films, from romantic comedies to social dramas, catering to diverse audiences and tastes. Gauri's commitment to quality and her ability to take risks have earned her a reputation as a respected and innovative film producer.\n\n**In the Media**\n\nGauri Khan is known for maintaining a low profile and keeping out of the public eye, a trait that has earned her the nickname \"media shy.\" Despite this, she has been featured on several high-profile magazine covers, including Vogue India, where she was hailed as the \"First Lady of Bollywood.\" Her photos, taken by renowned photographer Chris Craymer, showcased her style and elegance, and cemented her status as one of the most stylish women in Bollywood.\n\nGauri has also made appearances on the ramp, walking alongside her husband Shah Rukh Khan for fashion designer Karan Johar at the HDIL India Couture Week 2009. Her fashion sense and poise have inspired many, and she remains a style icon in the Indian entertainment industry.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGauri Khan first met Shah Rukh Khan in 1984, before his successful career in Bollywood.

that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head,\" he said [125] [132] Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled \"Get the fuck out of here\" and \"May the blood of  [unintelligible] be on your  [head or hands]\" [66] [132] The captain dived for cover to his left as she yelled \"Allah Akbar\" and fired at least two shots at them, missing them [70] [125] [132] An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her [66] [125] [132] [133] At that point, the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her [70] [66] [90] [132] A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; \"she shout [ed] in English that she wanted to kill Americans\" and then lost consciousness [66] [132]\n\n\nHospital treatment and evaluation\nSiddiqui was taken to U.S military base Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan by helicopter in critical condition [47] When she arrived at the hospital, she was rated at 3 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, but she underwent surgery without complication She was hospitalised at the Craig Theater Joint Hospital, and recovered over the next two weeks [60] [50] According to FBI reports prepared after the operation, Siddiqui repeatedly denied shooting anyone [135] FBI reports maintained that Siddiqui told a US special agent at the Craig Hospital on or about 1 August that \"spewing bullets at soldiers is bad,\" and expressed surprise that she was being treated well [135]\n\n\nCriminal complaint and trial\nIn pretrial activity, defense attorney Elaine Sharp said that the documents and item found on Siddiqui were planted [139] A government terrorism expert disagreed, stating there were \"hundred of pages in her own handwriting\" [140] In Pakistan, Siddiqui's sister Fowzia accused the US of raping and torturing her sister and denying her medical treatment The Pakistan National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution calling for Siddiqui's repatriation [141]\n\n\nCharges\nOn 31 July 2008, while Siddiqui was still being treated in Afghanistan, she was charged in a sealed criminal complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with assault with a deadly weapon and with attempting to kill a United States Army Captain \"while engaged in .. official duties.\" [66] [47] In total, she was charged on two counts of attempted murder of US nationals, officers, and employees, assault with a deadly weapon, carrying and using a firearm, and three counts of assault on US officers and employees [66] [144] [145]\n\n\nExtradition and arraignment\nOn 4 August 2008, Siddiqui was placed on an FBI jet and flown to New York City [47] after the Afghan government granted extradition to the United States for trial [148] She refused to appear for her arraignment or attend a hearing in September or meet with visitors [149] Siddiqui made her first appearance before a judge in a Manhattan courtroom on 6 August 2008 following which she was remanded into custody [145]\n\n\nMedical treatment and psychological assessments\nOn 11 August, after her counsel maintained that Siddiqui had not seen a doctor since arriving in the US the previous week, US Magistrate Judge Henry B Pitman ordered that she be examined by a medical doctor within 24 hours [150] Prosecutors maintained that Siddiqui had received adequate medical care for her gunshot wound but could not confirm whether she had been seen by a doctor or paramedic [151] The judge postponed her bail hearing until 3 September [152] An examination by a doctor the following day found no visible signs of infection; she also received a CAT scan [153]\n\n\nAntisemitism\n\nA three-person defence team was hired by the Pakistani embassy to supplement her two existing public defenders, but Siddiqui refused to co-operate with them [60] She tried to dismiss her lawyers on the grounds that they were Jewish [47] She said the case against her was a Jewish conspiracy, demanded that no Jews be allowed on the jury, [157] and that all prospective jurors be DNA-tested and excluded from the jury at her trial \"if they have a Zionist or Israeli background.\" She stated: \"they are all mad at me .. I have a feeling everyone here is them—subject to genetic testing They should be excluded, if you want to be fair.\" [143] In regard to her comments, Siddiqui's legal team stated that her incarceration had damaged her mind [70] [158]\n\nTrial proceedings\nAfter 18 months of detention, Siddiqui's trial began in New York City on 19 January 2010 [160] [161] [162] [163] Prior to the jury entering the courtroom, Siddiqui told onlookers that she would not work with her lawyers because the trial was a sham [164] She also said: \"I have information about attacks, more than 9/11! .. I want to help the President to end this group, to finish them .. They are a domestic, U.S group; they are not Muslim.\" [128] [165]\n\n\nConviction\nThe trial lasted 14 days with the jury deliberating for three days before reaching a verdict [166] [176] On 3 February 2010, Siddiqui was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder, armed assault, using and carrying a firearm, and three counts of assault on US officers and employees [177] [166] [176] After jurors found Siddiqui guilty, she exclaimed: \"This is a verdict coming from Israel, not America That's where the anger belongs.\" [178]\n\n\nSentencing\nSiddiqui was sentenced to 86 years in prison by Judge Berman on 23 September 2010 During the sentencing hearing, which lasted one hour, Siddiqui spoke on her own behalf [180] Upon hearing the verdict, she turned to trial spectators and told them that \"this verdict coming from Israel and not from America\" [173]\n\n\nImprisonment\nSiddiqui (Federal Bureau of Prisons #90279-054) was originally held at Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn [185] She is now being held in Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, a federal prison for female inmates with special mental health needs, and also relatively close to the home of her brother Ali Siddiqui [184] Her release date is 30 June 2082 [186] She was visited by her sister Fowzia Siddiqui in May 2023, accompanied by human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and Jamaat-e-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan [187] [188]\n\n\nChildren\nAccording to Arab News, Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, had personally requested Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai return Dr Aafia's children, including Ahmed (born 1996), to their family in Pakistan [189] In the summer of 2008 Aafia and a teenage boy were reported to have been apprehended by Afghan police [190] It was later confirmed that the teenage boy was her eldest son Ahmed On 26 August 2008, the United States Department of State confirmed that the youth captured with Aafia Siddiqi on 17 July 2008 was her son, American citizen Ahmed Siddiqi [191] Ahmed was transferred to the custody of Pakistani security officials [192] [193] [194] [195] Joanne Mariner, then Director of the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program at Human Rights Watch, criticized Afghanistan officials for transferring Ahmed to the National Directorate of Security due to its reputation for using torture as an interrogation tool Mariner pointed out that under Afghan law Ahmed was too young to be held criminally responsible  Ahmed was released from Afghanistan to his aunt in Pakistan following enormous outcry from the Pakistani public and politicians [196] While Pakistani law would normally give his father custody, his father did not want to fight the passionate public opinion supporting his aunt Fowzia [196] As of November 2009 [update], he was living with his aunt in Karachi; Fowzia prohibited him from talking to the press at that time [30] [47]\n\n\nReactions\nFor al-Qaeda and Pakistani jihadi groups, Siddiqui's case became a \"rallying cry\" and they joined in accusing the Pakistani government and military of failing to protect and avenge her [173] [199]\n\n\nAttacks, threats, and exchange offers\nFor al-Qaeda and Pakistani jihadi groups, Siddiqui's case became a \"rallying cry\" and they joined in accusing the Pakistani government and military of failing to protect and avenge her [173] [199]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe case was covered very differently in Pakistan than in the United States [225]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Aafia Siddiqui**\n\nAafia Siddiqui was a Pakistani neuroscientist who was convicted of attempting to kill US nationals and employees in Afghanistan in 2008.

Her father, Muhammad Salay Siddiqui, was a British-trained neurosurgeon, and her mother, Ismet, was an Islamic teacher and social worker.

She attended the University of Houston, where she was described by friends and family as being interested in religion and schoolwork. After three semesters, she transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she earned a degree in neuroscience. During her time at MIT, Siddiqui became increasingly involved in Islamic activism and began to associate with individuals who would later become connected to al-Qaeda.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nIn 1995, Siddiqui agreed to a marriage arranged by her mother to Amjad Mohammed Khan, a Karachi-born anesthesiologist who was studying in the US. The marriage ceremony was conducted over the telephone, and Khan later joined Siddiqui in the US. The couple had two children, a son, Muhammad Ahmed, born in 1996, and a daughter, Mariam Bint-e Muhammad, born in 1998.\n\n**Alleged Conspiracies and Kidnapping**\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Siddiqui became increasingly involved in extremist activities, including alleged conspiring with al-Qaeda operatives.

\"she shout [ed] in English that she wanted to kill Americans\" and then lost consciousness [66] [132]\n\n\nHospital treatment and evaluation\nSiddiqui was taken to U.S military base Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan by helicopter in critical condition [47] When she arrived at the hospital, she was rated at 3 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, but she underwent surgery without complication She was hospitalised at the Craig Theater Joint Hospital, and recovered over the next two weeks [60] [50] According to FBI reports prepared after the operation, Siddiqui repeatedly denied shooting anyone [135] FBI reports maintained that Siddiqui told a US special agent at the Craig Hospital on or about 1 August that \"spewing bullets at soldiers is bad,\" and expressed surprise that she was being treated well [135]\n\n\nCriminal complaint and trial\nIn pretrial activity, defense attorney Elaine Sharp said that the documents and item found on Siddiqui were planted [139] A government terrorism expert disagreed, stating there were \"hundred of pages in her own handwriting\" [140] In Pakistan, Siddiqui's sister Fowzia accused the US of raping and torturing her sister and denying her medical treatment The Pakistan National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution calling for Siddiqui's repatriation [141]\n\n\nCharges\nOn 31 July 2008, while Siddiqui was still being treated in Afghanistan, she was charged in a sealed criminal complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with assault with a deadly weapon and with attempting to kill a United States Army Captain \"while engaged in .. official duties.\" [66] [47] In total, she was charged on two counts of attempted murder of US nationals, officers, and employees, assault with a deadly weapon, carrying and using a firearm, and three counts of assault on US officers and employees [66] [144] [145]\n\n\nExtradition and arraignment\nOn 4 August 2008, Siddiqui was placed on an FBI jet and flown to New York City [47] after the Afghan government granted extradition to the United States for trial [148] She refused to appear for her arraignment or attend a hearing in September or meet with visitors [149] Siddiqui made her first appearance before a judge in a Manhattan courtroom on 6 August 2008 following which she was remanded into custody [145]\n\n\nMedical treatment and psychological assessments\nOn 11 August, after her counsel maintained that Siddiqui had not seen a doctor since arriving in the US the previous week, US Magistrate Judge Henry B Pitman ordered that she be examined by a medical doctor within 24 hours [150] Prosecutors maintained that Siddiqui had received adequate medical care for her gunshot wound but could not confirm whether she had been seen by a doctor or paramedic [151] The judge postponed her bail hearing until 3 September [152] An examination by a doctor the following day found no visible signs of infection; she also received a CAT scan [153]\n\n\nAntisemitism\n\nA three-person defence team was hired by the Pakistani embassy to supplement her two existing public defenders, but Siddiqui refused to co-operate with them [60] She tried to dismiss her lawyers on the grounds that they were Jewish [47] She said the case against her was a Jewish conspiracy, demanded that no Jews be allowed on the jury, [157] and that all prospective jurors be DNA-tested and excluded from the jury at her trial \"if they have a Zionist or Israeli background.\" She stated: \"they are all mad at me .. I have a feeling everyone here is them—subject to genetic testing They should be excluded, if you want to be fair.\" [143] In regard to her comments, Siddiqui's legal team stated that her incarceration had damaged her mind [70] [158]\n\nTrial proceedings\nAfter 18 months of detention, Siddiqui's trial began in New York City on 19 January 2010 [160] [161] [162] [163] Prior to the jury entering the courtroom, Siddiqui told onlookers that she would not work with her lawyers because the trial was a sham [164] She also said: \"I have information about attacks, more than 9/11! .. I want to help the President to end this group, to finish them .. They are a domestic, U.S group; they are not Muslim.\" [128] [165]\n\n\nConviction\nThe trial lasted 14 days with the jury deliberating for three days before reaching a verdict [166] [176] On 3 February 2010, Siddiqui was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder, armed assault, using and carrying a firearm, and three counts of assault on US officers and employees [177] [166] [176] After jurors found Siddiqui guilty, she exclaimed: \"This is a verdict coming from Israel, not America That's where the anger belongs.\" [178]\n\n\nSentencing\nSiddiqui was sentenced to 86 years in prison by Judge Berman on 23 September 2010 During the sentencing hearing, which lasted one hour, Siddiqui spoke on her own behalf [180] Upon hearing the verdict, she turned to trial spectators and told them that \"this verdict coming from Israel and not from America\" [173]\n\n\nImprisonment\nSiddiqui (Federal Bureau of Prisons #90279-054) was originally held at Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn [185] She is now being held in Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, a federal prison for female inmates with special mental health needs, and also relatively close to the home of her brother Ali Siddiqui [184] Her release date is 30 June 2082 [186] She was visited by her sister Fowzia Siddiqui in May 2023, accompanied by human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and Jamaat-e-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan [187] [188]\n\n\nChildren\nAccording to Arab News, Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, had personally requested Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai return Dr Aafia's children, including Ahmed (born 1996), to their family in Pakistan [189] In the summer of 2008 Aafia and a teenage boy were reported to have been apprehended by Afghan police [190] It was later confirmed that the teenage boy was her eldest son Ahmed On 26 August 2008, the United States Department of State confirmed that the youth captured with Aafia Siddiqi on 17 July 2008 was her son, American citizen Ahmed Siddiqi [191] Ahmed was transferred to the custody of Pakistani security officials [192] [193] [194] [195] Joanne Mariner, then Director of the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program at Human Rights Watch, criticized Afghanistan officials for transferring Ahmed to the National Directorate of Security due to its reputation for using torture as an interrogation tool Mariner pointed out that under Afghan law Ahmed was too young to be held criminally responsible  Ahmed was released from Afghanistan to his aunt in Pakistan following enormous outcry from the Pakistani public and politicians [196] While Pakistani law would normally give his father custody, his father did not want to fight the passionate public opinion supporting his aunt Fowzia [196] As of November 2009 [update], he was living with his aunt in Karachi; Fowzia prohibited him from talking to the press at that time [30] [47]\n\n\nReactions\nFor al-Qaeda and Pakistani jihadi groups, Siddiqui's case became a \"rallying cry\" and they joined in accusing the Pakistani government and military of failing to protect and avenge her [173] [199]\n\n\nAttacks, threats, and exchange offers\nFor al-Qaeda and Pakistani jihadi groups, Siddiqui's case became a \"rallying cry\" and they joined in accusing the Pakistani government and military of failing to protect and avenge her [173] [199]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe case was covered very differently in Pakistan than in the United States [225]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Kansas City would host Super Bowl XLIX However, the game was contingent on the successful passage of two sales taxes in Jackson County, Missouri, on April 4, 2006 [21]\n\n\nBidding process\nAfter the Kansas City plan fell through, the following submitted bids to host Super Bowl XLIX:\n\n\nTeams\nThe New England Patriots had a rough start to their 2014 season, starting the season with a 2–2 record and hitting a low point with a humiliating 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in week four [28] By this point, the Patriots faced heavy criticism in the media, especially quarterback Tom Brady [29] Former Patriots safety and teammate Rodney Harrison declared Brady \"looked scared to death\" in the pocket and \"doesn't have any confidence in his offensive line.\" [30] However, New England recovered with an NFL season long seven game winning streak, beginning with a dominating 43–17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in week five, and went on to lose only two more games for the rest of the year (the latter of which was done while resting the starters the final week of the season), finishing the season with a 12–4 record and the number one seed in the AFC [31] They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring (468 points) and eighth in points allowed (313), and had the largest point differential in the NFL (with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points) The Patriots defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35–31 in the AFC Divisional playoffs, and then defeated the Indianapolis Colts 45–7 in the AFC Championship Game [32] [33]\n\n\nNew England Patriots\nThe New England Patriots had a rough start

margin of victory of 9.7 points) The Patriots defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35–31 in the AFC Divisional playoffs, and then defeated the Indianapolis Colts 45–7 in the AFC Championship Game [32] [33]\n\n\nSeattle Seahawks\nAfter winning Super Bowl XLVIII the previous season, the Seahawks also struggled to begin the season, floundering near the season's midpoint with a 3–3 record However, they went on from there to win nine of their final 10 regular season games, preventing their opponents from scoring any touchdowns in five of them By the time they finished with a 12–4 record and entered the playoffs, they had earned the number one seed, and not allowed any touchdowns in the previous 10 quarters [35] Their defense ranked first in the NFL in fewest points allowed (254) and their offense was tied at first in rushing yards (2,762) [36] The Seahawks defeated the Carolina Panthers 31–17 in the NFC Divisional playoffs, and later defeated the Green Bay Packers 28–22 in overtime in the NFC Championship Game [37] [38] Seattle became the first NFC team to advance to consecutive Super Bowls since the 1996–97 Packers in Super Bowls XXXI and XXXII [39]\n\n\nPlayoffs\nNew England became the first playoff team to overcome two 14-point deficits to win a game as they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35–31, [41] pulling ahead for the first time in the game on Brady's 23-yard touchdown pass to LaFell with 5:13 left in regulation Then safety Duron Harmon iced the game by intercepting a pass from Joe Flacco in the end zone on Baltimore's ensuing drive Although New England only had 14 rushing yards, Brady's franchise playoff record 33 completions for 367 yards and three touchdowns, along with a rushing score, were able to make up the difference [41]\n\n\nPregame notes\nSuper Bowl XLIX was the first Super Bowl matchup, and the first postseason matchup, between the Patriots and Seahawks; while Seattle was part of the AFC before moving to the NFC in the NFL's 2002 realignment, the teams had never met beyond the regular season.\n\n\nTeam facilities\nThe Patriots used the Arizona Cardinals headquarters, in Tempe, Arizona, while the Seahawks used the Arizona State University practice facilities, also in Tempe [64]\n\n\nTickets\nTicket prices for Super Bowl XLIX rose quickly, with the lowest-cost tickets reaching over $8,000 by January 29 [65] [66] [67] The average ticket price charged by brokers was $10,352, an increase of more than three times over the previous year's prices [68] The raise in ticket prices was due to a shortage caused by the short selling practice of brokers and resale sites [69] [70] Jeff Miller, writing for the Orange County Register, observed that the cheapest tickets were nearly as expensive as a year's tuition at the University of Phoenix, and commented that the $28,888 price of seats near the 50-yard line \"should not only buy you Katy Perry's halftime show but also Katy Perry singing again from your backseat halfway through your drive home.\" [66]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nSuper Bowl XLIX was televised by NBC in the United States, with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color analyst Cris Collinsworth calling the game from the booth and Michele Tafoya working as sideline reporter Game coverage was preceded by a six-hour pre-game show featuring the Football Night in America crew, including Bob Costas, Dan Patrick, Josh Elliott, Tony Dungy, Rodney Harrison, Hines Ward, Mike Florio and Peter King John Harbaugh served as a guest analyst Michaels, Collinsworth and Tafoya also contributed to the

advertisement at US$4.5 million, [76] a price $500,000 above the record set by the two preceding Super Bowls [77] For the first time, the network also offered 15-second ad spots [78] A large number of automotive advertisers reduced their advertising during the game, replaced by a wave of fifteen first-time Super Bowl advertisers, including Skittles, Carnival Cruise Lines, [76] Loctite, Wix.com, [76] Jublia, a coalition of Mexican avocado growers, and Always among several others NBC posted the commercials on a Tumblr blog as they aired throughout the game; the blog was promoted through NBC's own live stream, as it did not contain all of the same commercials as the television broadcast [78] [79] [80] The network had more difficulty than in recent years selling out the advertisements, with the last ads selling out four days before the game [78]\n\n\nInternational\nSuper Bowl XLIX aired on Seven Network, 7mate, and ESPN in Australia, CTV in Canada, Sky Television in New Zealand, and

perform at halftime and the NFL confirmed the announcement on November 23, 2014 [5] [91] At the start of the halftime show, on-field participants held up light globes which created a bird's-eye view of the Pepsi logo [92] Perry entered the stadium riding atop a large, golden mechanical lion, opening her set with a performance of \"Roar\" [93] She then proceeded to sing \"Dark Horse\", with 3D rendering on the field creating a chessboard visual where the turf constantly turned into \"different shapes and sizes\", as acrobats surrounded the singer [92] [94] Following this, Perry joined Lenny Kravitz for a duet version of \"I Kissed a Girl\", which included her \"rubbing up against\" Kravitz and flames exploding behind them [94] [95] During these three songs, Perry was clothed in a \"flame-adorned\" dress, with her black hair in a ponytail [94] The costume has been described as the \"clothing equivalent of a flame\", [96] and \"dress of fire\" [92] The stage and field rendering transitioned into a \"breezy\" beach setting, with dancers dressed as sharks, palm trees and smiling beach balls dancing around Perry She underwent a wardrobe change, and progressed into a \"campy\" medley of \"Teenage Dream\" and \"California Gurls\" [93] [94] Rapper Missy Elliott subsequently appeared, performing her songs \"Get Ur Freak On\" and \"Work It\", while Perry played \"hype-woman\" beside her, having now changed once again into a custom Super Bowl 49 jersey After Perry briefly disappeared, Elliott performed \"Lose Control\" [94] Perry returned, now sporting a \"star-encrusted gown\" for her closing song, \"Firework\" She rose out of midfield on a narrow platform that was attached to a shooting star prop, and flew above the crowds During this performance, fireworks exploded around Perry and the stadium [94] [96] The star Perry flew around the stadium attached to was heavily compared to The More You Know's public service announcements logo [96] [97] It is the most-watched halftime show of all time, with a total TV audience of 120.7 million [98]\n\n\nGame summary\nAfter the teams exchanged punts to start the game, New England got the first scoring opportunity with a drive to the Seattle 10-yard line However, on 3rd-and-6, quarterback Tom Brady threw a pass that was intercepted and returned to the 14-yard line by cornerback Jeremy Lane Lane broke his wrist and tore his ACL on the play when he tried to break his fall with his arm extended after being tackled by wide receiver Julian Edelman, and was subsequently taken out of the game After the Patriots forced another Seahawks punt to start the second quarter, they mounted a 65-yard drive in nine plays, which began with Brady's 17-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Amendola Brady later completed a 23-yard pass to Edelman on 3rd-and-9, then finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon LaFell two plays later, giving the Patriots a 7–0 lead [101]\n\n\nFirst half\nAfter the

Brandon LaFell two plays later, giving the Patriots a 7–0 lead [101]\n\n\nSecond half\nSeattle took the second-half kickoff and drove 72 yards to the New England 8-yard line, featuring a 15-yard run by Lynch and a 45-yard reception by Matthews After Lynch was stopped for no gain on 3rd-and-1 in the red zone, kicker Stephen Hauschka finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal, giving Seattle their first lead of the game, 17–14 [103] On the Patriots' next possession, Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 6 yards to the New England 34, but an illegal blocking penalty against cornerback Richard Sherman after Wagner's interception forced the Seahawks to start their ensuing possession at midfield Just as with their last interception, Seattle lost a key defensive player to injury Defensive end Cliff Avril lay on the field motionless After finally getting to his feet, he entered concussion protocol and did not re-enter the game Seattle's pass rush, particularly Michael Bennett inside and Avril outside, had hurried Brady into several drive-ending incompletions as well as the first interception Wrote Gregg Bell of the Tacoma News Tribune, \"At times that night in the desert Bennett and Avril controlled the line of scrimmage almost by themselves.\" [104] With Avril out, the Patriots were able to double-team Bennett and give Brady more time in the pocket.\n\n\nGame statistics\nBrady completed 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards and four touchdowns, with two interceptions His 37 completions set a new Super Bowl record, surpassing Peyton Manning's 34 set the previous year against Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII He also surpassed Joe Montana's record for career touchdown passes in Super Bowls, setting a new record with 13 [111] His top receiver was Edelman, who caught 9 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for seven yards and returning three punts for 27 additional yards Vereen caught 11 passes for 64 yards and rushed for 13 For Seattle, Wilson completed 12 of 21 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 39 yards Lynch was the top rusher of the game with 102 yards and a touchdown, and also caught a pass for 31 yards Matthews, an undrafted rookie who had not caught any passes in the regular season or postseason before the Super Bowl, caught four passes for 109 yards and a touchdown Wagner had 12 tackles (10 solo) and an interception Linebacker K J Wright had 11 tackles (10 solo) [102] New England became only the fourth team to win a Super Bowl despite

faced heavy criticism for their decision to call a pass play on second and goal from the 1-yard line with 26 seconds and one timeout left instead of a rushing play Following the play, Collinsworth stated, \"I'm sorry, but I can't believe the call … I cannot believe the call You've got Marshawn Lynch in the backfield You've got a guy that has been borderline unstoppable in this part of the field I can't believe the call.\" He further added, \"If I lose the Super Bowl because Marshawn Lynch can't get it in from the 1 yard line, so be it So be it! But there is no way.. I don't believe the call.\" [116] [117] Sports Illustrated writer Peter King called the play one of the worst calls in Super Bowl history, [118] as did retired Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders [119] Retired running back Emmitt Smith, the NFL's all-time leading rusher, went even further, calling it the worst play call in the history of football [120] Others, including University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh and Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath, defended the call, crediting Butler for the play he made and pointing out that the Seahawks only had one time-out left [121] [122] Writing for Grantland, Bill Simmons said the Seahawks \"took too much heat for the final play call\" and noted Carroll opted to run the ball on fourth down at the end of the 2006 Rose Bowl, costing his team the game [123]\n\n\nBox score\nat University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona\n\n\nFinal statistics\nSources: NFL.com, Pro Football Reference.com, [135] [136] The Football Database Super Bowl XLIX\n\n\nStatistical comparison\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\n\n\nIndividual leaders\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\n\n\nStarting lineups\nHall of Fame‡\n\n\nOfficials\nSuper Bowl XLIX had seven officials [2] The numbers in parentheses below indicates their uniform numbers.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Super Bowl XLIX**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX was the 49th edition of the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). The game was played on February 1, 2015, at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The New England Patriots, led by quarterback Tom Brady, faced off against the Seattle Seahawks, led by quarterback Russell Wilson. The Patriots won the game 28-24, capturing their fourth Super Bowl title under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick.\n\n**Background**\n\nNFL owners initially voted in November 2005 to award a Super Bowl to Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, the founder of the American Football League (AFL) in the 1960s who helped engineer the annual game. Then-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue further announced on March 5, 2006, that Kansas City would host Super Bowl XLIX. However, the game was contingent on the successful passage of two sales taxes in Jackson County, Missouri, on April 4, 2006.\n\n**Host Selection Process**\n\nThe host city for Super Bowl XLIX was initially awarded to Kansas City, Missouri, in 2005. However, the game's hosting was contingent on the passage of two sales taxes in Jackson County, Missouri, which was ultimately successful. The game was then officially awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which was under construction at the time.\n\n**Initial Plan for Kansas City as Host City**\n\nThe initial plan was to host Super Bowl XLIX in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of Lamar Hunt, the founder of the AFL. The game was contingent on the passage of two sales taxes in Jackson County, Missouri, which was ultimately successful. However, the game was later awarded to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\n**Bidding Process**\n\nAfter the Kansas City plan fell through, the following submitted bids to host Super Bowl XLIX:\n\n* Glendale, Arizona\n* Miami, Florida\n* New Orleans, Louisiana\n* San Francisco, California\n\nThe city of Glendale, Arizona, ultimately won the hosting rights for Super Bowl XLIX.\n\n**Teams**\n\nThe New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks were the two teams that faced off in Super Bowl XLIX. The Patriots were led by quarterback Tom Brady, while the Seahawks were led by quarterback Russell Wilson.\n\n**New England Patriots**\n\nThe New England Patriots had a rough start to their 2014 season, starting the season with a 2-2 record and hitting a low point with a humiliating 41-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in week four. However, they recovered with an NFL season-long seven-game winning streak, beginning with a dominating 43-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in week five, and went on to lose only two more games for the rest of the year (the latter of which was done while resting the starters the final week of the season), finishing the season with a 12-4 record and the number one seed in the AFC.\n\n**Seattle Seahawks**\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks also struggled to begin the season, floundering near the season's midpoint with a 3-3 record. However, they went on from there to win nine of their final 10 regular season games, preventing their opponents from scoring any touchdowns in five of them. By the time they finished with a 12-4 record and entered the playoffs, they had earned the number one seed, and not allowed any touchdowns in the previous 10 quarters. Their defense ranked first in the NFL in fewest points allowed (254) and their offense was tied at first in rushing yards (2,762).\n\n**Playoffs**\n\nThe New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks faced off in the AFC Championship Game, with the Patriots winning 45-7. The Patriots then advanced to Super Bowl XLIX, where they faced off against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n**Pregame Notes**\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX was the first Super Bowl matchup, and the first postseason matchup, between the Patriots and Seahawks. While Seattle was part of the AFC before moving to the NFC in the NFL's 2002 realignment, the teams had never met beyond the regular season.\n\n**Team Facilities**\n\nThe Patriots used the Arizona Cardinals' headquarters, in Tempe, Arizona, while the Seahawks used the Arizona State University practice facilities, also in Tempe.\n\n**Tickets**\n\nTicket prices for Super Bowl XLIX rose quickly, with the lowest-cost tickets reaching over $8,000 by January 29. The average ticket price charged by brokers was $10,352, an increase of more than three times over the previous year's prices. The raise in ticket prices was due to a shortage caused by the short selling practice of brokers and resale sites.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX was televised by NBC in the United States, with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color analyst Cris Collinsworth calling the game from the booth and Michele Tafoya working as sideline reporter. Game coverage was preceded by a six-hour pre-game show featuring the Football Night in America crew, including Bob Costas, Dan Patrick, Josh Elliott, Tony Dungy, Rodney Harrison, Hines Ward, Mike Florio, and Peter King.\n\n**Advertising**\n\nNBC set the sales rate for a 30-second advertisement at $4.5 million, a price $500,000 above the record set by the two preceding Super Bowls. For the first time, the network also offered 15-second ad spots. A large number of automotive advertisers reduced their advertising during the game, replaced by a wave of fifteen first-time Super Bowl advertisers, including Skittles, Carnival Cruise Lines, Loctite, Wix.com, Jublia, a coalition of Mexican avocado growers, and Always among several others.\n\n**International**\n\nSuper Bowl XLIX aired on Seven Network, 7mate, and ESPN in Australia, CTV in Canada, Sky Television in New Zealand, and Channel 4, Sky Sports, and BBC Radio 5 Live in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\n**Streaming**\n\nNBC livestreamed the game for free on NBCSports.com on computers and the NBC Sports Live Extra app on tablets. Mobile device rights were exclusive to Verizon Wireless NFL Mobile for its subscribers who pay for NFL Mobile, and they had to use the NFL Mobile app instead of NBC Sports Live Extra.\n\n**Radio**\n\nThe game was broadcast nationally on Westwood One radio, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason as color analyst, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage, with Larry Fitzgerald, Tom Brady, Scott Graham, Rod Woodson, and Kurt Warner contributing.\n\n**Halftime Show**\n\nThe halftime show featured a performance by Katy Perry, who was accompanied by Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott. The show was widely praised and became the most-watched halftime show of all time, with a total TV audience of 120.7 million.\n\n**Game Summary**\n\nThe game was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trading scores throughout. The Seahawks took the lead early in the second quarter, but the Patriots responded with a touchdown of their own. The Seahawks took a 17-14 lead into the second half, but the Patriots stormed back to take a 24-14 lead. The Seahawks then scored a touchdown to cut the deficit to 24-21, but the Patriots responded with a field goal to take a 27-21 lead. The Seahawks scored a touchdown to tie the game at 28-28, but the Patriots responded with a field goal to take a 31-28 lead. The Seahawks then drove down to the Patriots' 1-yard line, but the Patriots' defense came up big, and the Seahawks were forced to settle for a field goal. The Patriots then won the game 28-24.\n\n**Final Statistics**\n\nThe final statistics for Super Bowl XLIX are as follows:\n\n* New England Patriots: 28-24\n* Seattle Seahawks: 24-28\n* Total yards: 494-417\n* Passing yards: 311-246\n* Rushing yards: 183-171\n* Turnovers: 2-1\n* Time of possession: 33:37-26:23\n\n**Individual Leaders**\n\nThe individual leaders for Super Bowl XLIX are as follows:\n\n* Tom Brady (Patriots): 37-50, 328 yards, 4 touchdowns, 2 interceptions\n* Russell Wilson (Seahawks): 12-21, 247 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interception\n* Rob Gronkowski (Patriots): 8-104, 1 touchdown\n* Marshawn Lynch (Seahawks): 102 yards, 1 touchdown\n* Richard Sherman (Seahawks): 9 tackles, 1 interception\n\n**Starting Lineups**\n\nThe starting lineups for Super Bowl XLIX are as follows:\n\n* New England Patriots:\n\t+ QB: Tom Brady\n\t+ RB: LeGarrette Blount\n\t+ WR: Julian Edelman\n\t+ TE: Rob Gronkowski\n\t+ LT: Nate Solder\n\t+ LG: Logan Mankins\n\t+ C: Ryan Wendell\n\t+ RG: Jordan Devey\n\t+ RT: Sebastian Vollmer\n* Seattle Seahawks:\n\t+ QB: Russell Wilson\n\t+ RB: Marshawn Lynch\n\t+ WR: Ricardo Lockette\n\t+ TE: Zach Miller\n\t+ LT: Russell Okung\n\t+ LG: James Carpenter\n\t+ C: Max Unger\n\t+ RG: J.R.

the NFC Championship Game [37] [38] Seattle became the first NFC team to advance to consecutive Super Bowls since the 1996–97 Packers in Super Bowls XXXI and XXXII [39]\n\n\nPlayoffs\nNew England became the first playoff team to overcome two 14-point deficits to win a game as they defeated the Baltimore Ravens 35–31, [41] pulling ahead for the first time in the game on Brady's 23-yard touchdown pass to LaFell with 5:13 left in regulation Then safety Duron Harmon iced the game by intercepting a pass from Joe Flacco in the end zone on Baltimore's ensuing drive Although New England only had 14 rushing yards, Brady's franchise playoff record 33 completions for 367 yards and three touchdowns, along with a rushing score, were able to make up the difference [41]\n\n\nPregame

drive to the Seattle 10-yard line However, on 3rd-and-6, quarterback Tom Brady threw a pass that was intercepted and returned to the 14-yard line by cornerback Jeremy Lane Lane broke his wrist and tore his ACL on the play when he tried to break his fall with his arm extended after being tackled by wide receiver Julian Edelman, and was subsequently taken out of the game After the Patriots forced another Seahawks punt to start the second quarter, they mounted a 65-yard drive in nine plays, which began with Brady's 17-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Amendola Brady later completed a 23-yard pass to Edelman on 3rd-and-9, then finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon LaFell two plays later, giving the Patriots a 7–0 lead [101]\n\n\nFirst half\nAfter the

Brandon LaFell two plays later, giving the Patriots a 7–0 lead [101]\n\n\nSecond half\nSeattle took the second-half kickoff and drove 72 yards to the New England 8-yard line, featuring a 15-yard run by Lynch and a 45-yard reception by Matthews After Lynch was stopped for no gain on 3rd-and-1 in the red zone, kicker Stephen Hauschka finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal, giving Seattle their first lead of the game, 17–14 [103] On the Patriots' next possession, Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 6 yards to the New England 34, but an illegal blocking penalty against cornerback Richard Sherman after Wagner's interception forced the Seahawks to start their ensuing possession at midfield Just as with their last interception, Seattle lost a key defensive player to injury Defensive end Cliff Avril lay on the field motionless After finally getting to his feet, he entered concussion protocol and did not re-enter the game Seattle's pass rush, particularly Michael Bennett inside and Avril outside, had hurried Brady into several drive-ending incompletions as well as the first interception Wrote Gregg Bell of the Tacoma News Tribune, \"At times that night in the desert Bennett and Avril controlled the line of scrimmage almost by themselves.\" [104] With Avril out, the Patriots were able to double-team Bennett and give Brady more time in the pocket.\n\n\nGame statistics\nBrady completed 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards and four touchdowns, with two interceptions His 37 completions set a new Super Bowl record, surpassing Peyton Manning's 34 set the previous year against Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII He also surpassed Joe Montana's record for career touchdown passes in Super Bowls, setting a new record with 13 [111] His top receiver was Edelman, who caught 9 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for seven yards and returning three punts for 27 additional yards Vereen caught 11 passes for 64 yards and rushed for 13 For Seattle, Wilson completed 12 of 21 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, while also rushing for 39 yards Lynch was the top rusher of the game with 102 yards and a touchdown, and also caught a pass for 31 yards Matthews, an undrafted rookie who had not caught any passes in the regular season or postseason before the Super Bowl, caught four passes for 109 yards and a touchdown Wagner had 12 tackles (10 solo) and an interception Linebacker K J Wright had 11 tackles (10 solo) [102] New England became only the fourth team to win a Super Bowl despite losing the turnover battle (after the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V and the Pittsburgh Steelers in both Super Bowls XIV and XL) [112]\n\n\nReactions to Seattle's final play\nAfter the game, Seattle faced heavy criticism for their decision to call a pass play on second and goal from the 1-yard line with 26 seconds and one timeout left instead of a rushing play Following the play, Collinsworth stated, \"I'm sorry, but I can't believe the call … I cannot believe the call You've got Marshawn Lynch in the backfield You've got a guy that has been borderline unstoppable in this part of the field

The band's history is marked by its evolution from a blues-influenced group to a psychedelic rock band, and its eventual breakup and reformation.\n\n**History**\n-----------\n\nThe Yardbirds formed in the south-west London suburbs in 1963. The original members were Keith Relf, Jim McCarty, Chris Dreja, and Top Topham, who were joined by bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and later by guitarist Eric Clapton. The band's early sound was heavily influenced by the blues, and they often played covers of blues classics.\n\nThe band changed its name from the Metropolitan Blues Quartet to the Yardbirds in 1963, reportedly inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel \"On the Road,\" which referred to railroad yard hobos. The name was also suggested by Topham, who identified it as a nickname for jazz saxophonist Charlie \"Yardbird\" Parker.\n\n**Beginnings and Clapton Line-up (1963-1965)**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Yardbirds' early years were marked by their performances at various clubs and venues in London. They played blues covers and original material, and their sound was characterized by Clapton's guitar work and Relf's vocals. The band's popularity grew, and they were eventually signed to Columbia Records.\n\nDuring this period, the Yardbirds released several singles, including \"I'm a Man\" and \"Good Morning Little School Girl.\" The band's music was well-received by critics and audiences alike, and they were hailed as one of the leading blues-influenced bands in the UK.\n\n**Beck Line-up (1965-1966)**\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1965, the Yardbirds underwent a significant change with the arrival of guitarist Jeff Beck, who replaced Clapton. Beck's playing style was more experimental and psychedelic than Clapton's, and he brought a new sonic dimension to the band's music. The Yardbirds began to explore new musical styles, including Eastern influences and psychedelic rock.\n\nBeck's influence on the Yardbirds' sound was significant, and he was voted No. 1 lead guitarist of 1966 in the British music magazine Beat Instrumental. During this period, the Yardbirds released several singles, including \"Heart Full of Soul\" and \"Shapes of Things.\" The band's music was becoming increasingly experimental and psychedelic, and they were on the verge of a new musical direction.\n\n**Beck/Page Line-up (1966)**\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1966, the Yardbirds released their second album, \"Roger the Engineer,\" which was produced by Samwell-Smith. The album was a critical and commercial success, and it marked a new era in the band's music. However, the album's success was short-lived, as Samwell-Smith quit the band in August 1966, reportedly due to personal and creative differences.\n\nJimmy Page, who had been playing bass with the Yardbirds, took over as lead guitarist, and the band embarked on a new musical direction. The Yardbirds' sound became even more experimental and psychedelic, and they began to incorporate new musical styles, including Eastern influences and electronic sounds.\n\n**Page Line-up and Split (1966-1968)**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Yardbirds' music during this period was characterized by Page's innovative guitar work and the band's increasing experimentation with new sounds. The band released several singles, including \"Happenstance\" and \"Little Games.\" However, the Yardbirds' popularity was waning, and the band eventually broke up in July 1968.\n\nPage, who had become disillusioned with the band's commercial direction, decided to leave and form a new band with guitarist Jimmy Page. The new band, which would eventually become Led Zeppelin, was formed with drummer John Bonham and bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones.\n\n**The New Yardbirds/Led Zeppelin (1968)**\n---------------------------------------\n\nAfter the Yardbirds broke up, Page and Dreja saw an opportunity to put a new lineup together, with Page as producer and Grant as manager. The new band, which was initially called the New Yardbirds, was formed with Bonham and Jones. The band's sound was characterized by Page's innovative guitar work and the band's increasing experimentation with new sounds.\n\nThe New Yardbirds' debut gig was a successful show in Scandinavia, and the band eventually returned to the UK to produce their debut album. The album, which was released in 1969, was a critical and commercial success, and it marked the beginning of Led Zeppelin's successful career.\n\n**After the Yardbirds (1968-1992)**\n-------------------------------\n\nAfter the Yardbirds broke up, Keith Relf and Jim McCarty went on to form an acoustic rock band called Together, which later became Renaissance. The band released two albums for Island Records, and McCarty also formed the band Shoot in 1973. Relf, who had become disillusioned with the music industry, eventually died in an electrical accident in his home studio in 1976.\n\nIn 1977, Illusion was formed, featuring a reunited lineup of the original Renaissance, including McCarty and Keith's sister Jane Relf. The band released several albums, including \"Illusion\" and \"Pavane.\" However, the band's popularity was short-lived, and they eventually disbanded.\n\n**Reformation (1992-Present)**\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1992, Peter Barton from Rock Artist Management contacted Jim McCarty about the prospect of reforming the Yardbirds. McCarty was interested, but only if Chris Dreja would agree. The two eventually agreed, and the band's first gig was booked at the Marquee Club in London. The lineup featured John Idan handling bass and lead vocals, and the band's music was well-received by critics and audiences alike.\n\nThe Yardbirds have since toured extensively and released several albums, including \"Birdland\" and \"Live at the Marquee.\" The band's music is characterized by its blend of blues, rock, and psychedelic sounds, and they continue to be one of the leading blues-influenced bands in the UK.\n\n**Musical Style**\n-----------------\n\nThe Yardbirds' music is characterized by its blend of blues, rock, and psychedelic sounds. The band's early sound was heavily influenced by the blues, and they often played covers of blues classics. However, as the band evolved, they began to incorporate new musical styles, including Eastern influences and electronic sounds.\n\nThe Yardbirds' music is characterized by its use of extended instrumental improvisations and its emphasis on texture and atmosphere. The band's sound is often described as psychedelic rock, and they are often credited with helping to shape the genre.\n\n**Members**\n------------\n\n* Keith Relf (guitar, vocals)\n* Jim McCarty (drums, percussion)\n* Chris Dreja (bass guitar)\n* Top Topham (guitar)\n* Paul Samwell-Smith (bass guitar)\n* Eric Clapton (guitar)\n* Jeff Beck (guitar)\n* Jimmy Page (guitar)\n* John Idan (bass guitar, vocals)\n\n**Discography**\n----------------\n\n* \"Five Live Yardbirds\" (1964)\n* \"Having a Rave Up with the Yardbirds\" (1965)\n* \"For Your Love\" (1965)\n* \"Rogers the Engineer\" (1966)\n* \"Little Games\" (1967)\n* \"Yardbirds '68\" (1968)\n* \"Live at the Marquee\" (1992)\n* \"Birdland\" (1994)\n\nNote: The discography is not exhaustive and only includes a selection of the band's most notable releases.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Yardbirds\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe band formed in the south-west London suburbs in 1963 Relf and Samwell-Smith were originally in a band named the Metropolitan Blues Quartet After being joined by Dreja, McCarty, and Top Topham, they performed at Kingston Art School in late May 1963 as a backup band for Cyril Davies Following a couple of gigs in September 1963 as the Blue-Sounds, they changed their name to the Yardbirds McCarty claims that Relf was the first to use the name;

{"title": "Haryana", "content": "\nEtymology\nAnthropologists came up with the view that Haryana was known by this name because in the post-Mahabharata period, the Ābhiras live here, [14] who developed special skills in the art of agriculture [15] According to Pran Nath Chopra, Haryana evolved as a word from Ābhirāyana (from ābhira and ayana \"path, way\") to Ahirāyana to Hariyānā (Haryana) [16]\n\n\nHistory\nThe villages of Rakhigarhi in Hisar district and Bhirrana in Fatehabad district are home to ancient sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, which contain evidence of paved roads, a drainage system, a large-scale rainwater collection storage system, terracotta brick and statue production, and skilled metalworking (in both bronze and precious metals) [17]\n\n\nAncient period\nThe villages of Rakhigarhi in Hisar district and Bhirrana in Fatehabad district are home to ancient sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, which contain evidence of paved roads, a drainage system, a large-scale rainwater collection storage system, terracotta brick and statue production, and skilled metalworking (in both bronze and precious metals) [17]\n\n\nMedieval period\nAncient bronze and stone idols of Jain Tirthankara were found in archaeological expeditions in Badli, Bhiwani (Ranila, Charkhi Dadri and Badhra), Dadri, Gurgaon (Gurugram), Hansi, Hisar, Kasan, Nahad, Narnaul, Pehowa, Rewari, Rohad, Rohtak (Asthal Bohar) and Sonepat in Haryana [21]\n\n\nBritish Period\nThe state was part of the British Punjab province The Delhi division of Punjab province formed the bulk of Haryana Among the princely states that were located in the state were Jind, Kalsia, Loharu, Dujana and Pataudi, as well as parts of the Patiala State.\n\n\nPartition and aftermath\nDuring the Partition of India, the Punjab province was one of two British Indian provinces, alongside Bengal, to be partitioned between India and Pakistan Haryana, along with other Hindu and Sikh-dominated areas of Punjab province, became part of India as East Punjab state As a result, a significant number of Muslims left for the newly formed country of Pakistan Similarly, a huge number of Hindu and Sikh refugees poured into the state from West Punjab Gopi Chand Bhargava, who hailed from Sirsa in present-day Haryana, became the first Chief Minister of East Punjab.\n\n\nFormation of Haryana\nHaryana as a state came into existence on 1 November 1966 the Punjab Reorganisation Act (1966) The Indian government set up the Shah Commission under the chairmanship of Justice JC Shah on 23 April 1966 to divide the existing state of Punjab and determine the boundaries of the new state of Haryana after consideration of the languages spoken by the people It encompassed the predominantly Hindi-speaking southern part of former Punjab, while the state of Punjab was reduced to the area where Punjabi speakers formed the majority population The commission delivered its report on 31 May 1966 whereby the then-districts of Hisar, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Rohtak and Karnal were to be a part of the new state of Haryana Further, the tehsils of Jind and Narwana in the Sangrur district – along with Naraingarh, Ambala and Jagadhri – were to be included [27]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs per 2019 estimates, the caste wise composition of Haryana is 25-27% Jats, 21% Scheduled Caste, 8% Punjabis, 7.5% Brahmins, 5.1% Ahir/Yadav, 5% Vaish, 4% Jat Sikhs, 3.8% Meos and other Muslims, 3.4% Rajputs, 3.4% Gujjar, 2.9% Saini, 2.7% Kumhars, 1.1% Ror and 0.7% Bishnois [33] [34]\n\n\nCastes and tribes\nAs per 2019 estimates, the caste wise composition of Haryana is 25-27% Jats, 21% Scheduled Caste, 8% Punjabis, 7.5% Brahmins, 5.1% Ahir/Yadav, 5% Vaish, 4% Jat Sikhs, 3.8% Meos and other Muslims, 3.4% Rajputs, 3.4% Gujjar, 2.9% Saini, 2.7% Kumhars, 1.1% Ror and 0.7% Bishnois [33] [34]\n\n\nLanguages\nLanguages of Haryana (2011) [35]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Haryana (2011) [42]\n\n\nCulture\nHaryana has its own unique traditional folk music, folk dances, saang (folk theatre), [54] cinema, [55] belief system such as Jathera (ancestral worship), [56] [57] and arts such as Phulkari and Shisha embroidery [57]\n\n\nMusic\nHaryana has its own unique traditional folk music, folk dances, saang (folk theatre), [54] cinema, [55] belief system such as Jathera (ancestral worship), [56] [57] and arts such as Phulkari and Shisha embroidery [57]\n\n\nFolk dances\nFolk music and dances of Haryana are based on satisfying the cultural needs of primarily agrarian and martial natures of Haryanavi tribes [58]\n\n\nFolk music and songs\nHaryanvi folk music is based on day-to-day themes and injecting earthly humour enlivens the feel of the songs [56] Haryanvi music takes two main forms: \"Classical folk music\" and \"Desi Folk music\" (Country Music of Haryana), [59] and sung in the form of ballads and love, valor and bravery, harvest, happiness and pangs of the parting of lovers [58] [59] [60]\n\n\nClassical Haryanvi folk music\nClassical Haryanvi folk music is based on Indian classical music [59] Hindustani classical ragas, learnt in gharana parampara of guru–shishya tradition, are used to sing songs of heroic bravery (such as Alha-Khand (1163–1202 CE) about the bravery of Alha and Udal, Jaimal and Patta of Maharana Udai Singh II), Brahmas worship and festive seasonal songs (such as Teej, Holi and Phaag songs of Phalgun month near Holi) [59] [60] Bravery songs are sung in high pitch [58]\n\n\nDesi Haryanvi folk music\nDesi Haryanvi folk music, is a form of Haryanvi music, based on Raag Bhairvi, Raag Bhairav, Raag Kafi, Raag Jaijaivanti, Raag Jhinjhoti and Raag Pahadi and used for celebrating community bonhomie to sing seasonal songs, ballads, ceremonial songs (wedding, etc.) and related religious legendary tales such as Puran Bhagat [59] [60] Relationship and songs celebrating love and life are sung in medium pitch Ceremonial and religious songs are sung in low pitch [58] Young girls and women usually sing entertaining and fast seasonal, love, relationship and friendship-related songs such as Phagan (song for eponymous season/month), Katak (songs for the eponymous season/month), Samman (songs for the eponymous season/month), bande-bandi (male-female duet songs), sathne (songs of sharing heartfelt feelings among female friends) [58] Older women usually sing devotional Mangal Geet (auspicious songs) and ceremonial songs such as Bhajan, Bhat (wedding gift to the mother of bride or groom by her brother), Sagai, Ban (Hindu wedding ritual where pre-wedding festivities starts), Kuan-Poojan (a custom that is performed to welcome the birth of a child by worshiping the well or source of drinking water), Sanjhi and Holi festival [58]\n\n\nSocially normative-cohesive impact\nMusic and dance for Haryanvi people is a way of lessening societal differences as folk singers are highly esteemed and they are sought after and invited for events, ceremonies and special occasions regardless of their caste or status These inter-caste songs are fluid in nature, and never personalised for any specific caste, and they are sung collectively by women from different strata, castes, and dialects These songs transform fluidly in dialect, style, words, etc This adoptive style can be seen in the adoption of tunes of Bollywood movie songs into Haryanvi songs Despite this continuous fluid transforming nature, Haryanvi songs have a distinct style of their own as explained above [58]\n\n\nCuisine\nAs per a survey, 13% of males and 7.8% of females of Haryana are non-vegetarian [62] The cuisine of Haryana, rooted in its predominantly agricultural society, has maintained a simple and uncomplicated essence [63] The regional cuisine features the staples of roti, saag, vegetarian sabzi and milk products such as ghee, milk, lassi and kheer [64] Haryana is often referred to as the 'Land of Rotis' due to its residents' fondness for various types of rotis Wheat rotis are ubiquitous, along with the popular baajre ki roti In the past, rotis were commonly made from a blend of wheat, gram, and barley flour, offering a nutritious and wholesome combination Another notable variety is the gochini atta, crafted from wheat and gram flour [65] Haryana is renowned for its abundant livestock, including the famed Murrah buffalo and the  Haryana cow This cattle wealth ensures a plentiful supply of milk and dairy products in Haryanvi cuisine Many households produce their own butter and ghee, which are generously incorporated into daily meals Fresh homemade butter, known as \"nooni\" or \"tindi ghee,\" is commonly churned on a daily basis When a girl becomes a mother, it's customary for her family to present her with gifts of ghee, edible gum (gondh), laddus (sweetmeats made from gram flour), and dry fruits Buttermilk, known as \"chaaj,\" is a popular beverage and serves as an instant refresher during the summer months Lassi, made from yogurt, is another beloved drink that can almost constitute a meal in itself The Haryanvi fondness for lassi is evident in the fact that \"thandai,\" a sweet milk-based drink, is referred to as \"kachi lassi\" in Haryana [63]\n\n\nSociety\nHaryanvi people have a concept of inclusive society involving the \"36 Jātis\" or communities Castes such as Jat, Rajput, Gurjar, Saini, Pasi, Ahirs, Ror, Meo, Charan, Bishnoi, Harijan, Aggarwal, Brahmin, Khatri and Tyagi are some of the notable of these 36 Jātis [66] [67]\n\n\nGeography\nHaryana is a landlocked state in northern India It is between 27°39' to 30°35' N latitude and between 74°28' and 77°36' E longitude [68] The total geographical area of the state is 4.42 m ha, which is 1.4% of the geographical area of the country [69] The altitude of Haryana varies between 700 and 3600 ft (200 metres to 1200 metres) above sea level [70] Haryana has only 4% (compared with national 21.85%) area under forests [8]

Muslims left for the newly formed country of Pakistan Similarly, a huge number of Hindu and Sikh refugees poured into the state from West Punjab Gopi Chand Bhargava, who hailed from Sirsa in present-day Haryana, became the first Chief Minister of East Punjab.\n\n\nFormation of Haryana\nHaryana as a state came into existence on 1 November 1966 the Punjab Reorganisation Act (1966) The Indian government set up the Shah Commission under the chairmanship of Justice JC Shah on 23 April 1966 to divide the existing state of Punjab and determine the boundaries of the new state of Haryana after consideration of the languages spoken by the people It encompassed the predominantly Hindi-speaking southern part of former Punjab, while the state of Punjab was reduced to the area where Punjabi speakers formed the majority population The commission delivered its report on 31 May 1966 whereby the then-districts of Hisar, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Rohtak and Karnal were to be a part of the new state of Haryana Further, the tehsils of Jind and Narwana in the Sangrur district – along with Naraingarh, Ambala and Jagadhri – were to be included [27]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs per 2019

[34]\n\n\nLanguages\nLanguages of Haryana (2011) [35]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Haryana (2011) [42]\n\n\nCulture\nHaryana has its own unique traditional folk music, folk dances, saang (folk theatre), [54] cinema, [55] belief system such as Jathera (ancestral worship), [56] [57] and arts such as Phulkari and Shisha embroidery [57]\n\n\nMusic\nHaryana has its own unique traditional folk music, folk dances, saang (folk theatre), [54] cinema, [55] belief system such as Jathera (ancestral worship), [56] [57] and arts such as Phulkari and Shisha embroidery [57]\n\n\nFolk dances\nFolk music and dances of Haryana are based on satisfying the cultural needs of primarily agrarian and martial natures of Haryanavi tribes [58]\n\n\nFolk music and songs\nHaryanvi folk music is based on day-to-day themes and injecting earthly humour enlivens the feel of the songs [56] Haryanvi music takes two main forms: \"Classical folk music\" and \"Desi Folk music\" (Country Music of Haryana), [59] and sung in the form of ballads and love, valor and bravery, harvest, happiness and pangs of the parting of lovers [58] [59] [60]\n\n\nClassical Haryanvi folk music\nClassical Haryanvi folk music is based on Indian classical music [59] Hindustani classical ragas, learnt in gharana parampara of guru–shishya tradition, are used to sing songs of heroic bravery (such as Alha-Khand (1163–1202 CE) about the bravery of Alha and Udal, Jaimal and Patta of Maharana Udai Singh II), Brahmas worship and festive seasonal songs (such as Teej, Holi and Phaag songs of Phalgun month near Holi) [59] [60] Bravery songs are sung in high pitch [58]\n\n\nDesi Haryanvi folk music\nDesi Haryanvi folk music, is a form of Haryanvi music, based on Raag Bhairvi, Raag Bhairav, Raag Kafi, Raag Jaijaivanti, Raag Jhinjhoti and Raag Pahadi and used for celebrating community bonhomie to sing seasonal songs, ballads, ceremonial songs (wedding, etc.) and related religious legendary tales such as Puran Bhagat [59] [60] Relationship and songs celebrating love and life are sung in medium pitch Ceremonial and religious songs are sung in low pitch [58] Young girls and women usually sing entertaining and fast seasonal, love, relationship and friendship-related songs such as Phagan (song for eponymous season/month), Katak (songs for the eponymous season/month), Samman (songs for the eponymous season/month), bande-bandi (male-female duet songs), sathne (songs of sharing heartfelt feelings among female friends) [58] Older women usually sing devotional Mangal Geet (auspicious songs) and ceremonial songs such as Bhajan, Bhat (wedding gift to the mother of bride or groom by her brother), Sagai, Ban (Hindu wedding ritual where pre-wedding festivities starts), Kuan-Poojan (a custom that is performed to welcome the birth of a child by worshiping the well or source of drinking water), Sanjhi and Holi festival [58]\n\n\nSocially normative-cohesive impact\nMusic and dance for Haryanvi people is a way of lessening societal differences as folk singers are highly esteemed and they are sought after and invited for events, ceremonies and special occasions regardless of their caste or status These inter-caste songs are fluid in nature, and never personalised for any specific caste, and they are sung collectively by women from different strata, castes, and dialects These songs transform fluidly in dialect, style, words, etc This adoptive style can be seen in the adoption of tunes of Bollywood movie songs into Haryanvi songs Despite this continuous fluid transforming nature, Haryanvi songs have a distinct style of their own as explained above [58]\n\n\nCuisine\nAs per a survey, 13% of males and 7.8% of females of Haryana are non-vegetarian [62] The cuisine of Haryana, rooted in its predominantly agricultural society, has maintained a simple and uncomplicated essence [63] The regional cuisine features the staples of roti, saag, vegetarian sabzi and milk products such as ghee, milk, lassi and kheer [64] Haryana is often referred to as the 'Land of Rotis' due to its residents' fondness for various types of rotis Wheat rotis are ubiquitous, along with the popular baajre ki roti In the past, rotis were commonly made from a blend of wheat, gram, and barley flour, offering a nutritious and wholesome combination Another notable variety is the gochini atta, crafted from wheat and gram flour [65] Haryana is renowned for its abundant livestock, including the famed Murrah buffalo and the  Haryana cow This cattle wealth ensures a plentiful supply of milk and dairy products in Haryanvi cuisine Many households produce their own butter and ghee, which are generously incorporated into daily meals Fresh homemade butter, known as \"nooni\" or \"tindi ghee,\" is commonly churned on a daily basis When a girl becomes a mother, it's customary for her family to present her with gifts of ghee, edible gum (gondh), laddus (sweetmeats made from gram flour), and dry fruits Buttermilk, known as \"chaaj,\" is a popular beverage and serves as an instant refresher during the summer months Lassi, made from yogurt, is another beloved drink that can almost constitute a meal in itself The Haryanvi fondness for lassi is evident in the fact that \"thandai,\" a sweet milk-based drink, is referred to as \"kachi lassi\" in Haryana [63]\n\n\nSociety\nHaryanvi people have a concept of inclusive society involving the \"36 Jātis\" or communities Castes such as Jat, Rajput, Gurjar, Saini, Pasi, Ahirs, Ror, Meo, Charan, Bishnoi, Harijan, Aggarwal, Brahmin, Khatri and Tyagi

they kept about 1,060 cattle In 2010, it was proposed to resettle them [5] This notification was criticised by activists and conservationists as having been intransparent and undemocratic [6]\n\n\nGeography\nMudumalai National Park covers 321 km2 (124 sq mi) in the eastern hills of the Western Ghats at an elevation range of 850–1,250 m (2,790–4,100 ft); it is bordered in the west by Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, in the north by Bandipur National Park and in the east by Sigur Reserve Forest [4] In the south, it is bordered by Singara Reserve Forest [9] The Moyar River enters the national park in the south and is joined by five tributaries [10] Together they drain this area, and several artificial waterholes provide drinking water for wildlife during dry seasons [9]\nThe original national park area together with a surrounding buffer zone of 367.59 km2 (141.93 sq mi) was designated as the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve [11] [12]\n\n\nClimate\nMudumalai National Park receives about 1,420 mm (56 in) rainfall annually, most of it during the southwest monsoon season from June to September The temperature drops during the cool season from December to January, but rises during April to June, which are the hottest months [14]\nAnnual precipitation ranges from 1,100 mm (43 in) in the south and west to 600 mm (24 in) in the east [17]\n\n\nFlora\nMudumalai National Park harbours tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests [15] The floral diversity comprises 498 plant species including 154 tree, 77 shrub, 214 herb and 53 vine species [18]\nTeak (Tectona grandis) and axlewood (Anogeissus latifolia) are the dominant tree species with a density of more than 105 trees/ha (42 trees/acre) [19]\nProminent tree species include flame-of-the-forest (Butea monosperma), Indian laurel (Terminalia elliptica), kusum tree (Schleichera oleosa), weaver's beam tree (Schrebera swietenioides), Malabar kino tree (Pterocarpus marsupium), Indian rosewood (Dalbergia latifolia), Malabar plum (Syzygium cumini), silk-cotton tree (Bombax ceiba) and Indian beech (Millettia pinnata);

The park is situated at an elevation range of 850–1,250 meters (2,790–4,100 feet) and covers an area of 321 square kilometers (124 square miles). It is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, with a wide range of flora and fauna.\n\n**History**\n\nThe name \"Mudumalai\" is a Tamil word that means \"ancient forest.\" The park has been in existence for centuries, and its history dates back to the time of the Raja of Neelambur, who rented the forest to the British Government for logging purposes in 1857. In 1914, large forest tracts on the Sigur Plateau were declared as reserve forest for systematic logging. An area of about 60 square kilometers (23 square miles) was established as Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in 1940. The sanctuary was enlarged in 1977 and incorporated into the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in 1986. In 2007, the park was declared as a Tiger Reserve under Project Tiger, and it was notified as a \"Critical Tiger Habitat\" in December of the same year.\n\n**Geography**\n\nMudumalai National Park is located in the eastern hills of the Western Ghats, bordered by the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary in the west, Bandipur National Park in the north, Sigur Reserve Forest in the east, and Singara Reserve Forest in the south. The Moyar River enters the national park in the south and is joined by five tributaries. The original national park area, along with a surrounding buffer zone of 367.59 square kilometers (141.93 square miles), was designated as the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.\n\n**Climate**\n\nMudumalai National Park receives an average annual rainfall of 1,420 millimeters (56 inches), most of which falls during the southwest monsoon season from June to September. The temperature drops during the cool season from December to January, but rises during April to June, which are the hottest months. The annual precipitation ranges from 1,100 millimeters (43 inches) in the south and west to 600 millimeters (24 inches) in the east.\n\n**Flora**\n\nMudumalai National Park harbors tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. The park's floral diversity comprises 498 plant species, including 154 tree, 77 shrub, 214 herb, and 53 vine species.

Development of the system began in the late 1970s, with the first combat vehicles being developed and tested in the early 1980s.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea of a heavy short-range MLRS to launch rockets equipped with incendiary and thermobaric warheads arose in the late 1970s. The Soviet Union's military recognized the need for a system capable of delivering high-explosive warheads in large quantities, particularly in urban warfare scenarios. The combat system consisting of the combat vehicle, rockets, and loading vehicle was developed in early 1980s at KBTM in Omsk and was named TOS-1, remaining a secret development for a long time.\n\nThe TOS-1 system was designed to be highly mobile and adaptable, with the ability to launch a variety of rockets from its 30-tube launcher. The system's design allowed for the use of different types of warheads, including high-explosive fragmentation, incendiary, and thermobaric warheads. The TOS-1 was also equipped with a sophisticated fire control system, allowing for accurate targeting and precise delivery of the warheads.\n\n**Combat History**\n\nTOS-1s were first used in combat in Afghanistan's Panjshir valley by the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War. The system played a significant role in the conflict, providing the Soviet military with a highly effective means of delivering high-explosive warheads against enemy positions. The TOS-1's ability to launch multiple rockets in rapid succession made it an ideal system for targeting and suppressing enemy strongpoints.\n\nLater, the TOS-1 system was used during the Second Chechen War, where it played a key role in the Russian military's campaign against separatist forces. The system's performance in the conflict was notable, with reports indicating that the TOS-1 was highly effective in delivering precise and accurate firepower against enemy targets.\n\n**System Description**\n\nThe TOS-1A Solntsepyok (Russian: Солнцепёк, Blazing Sun) system consists of the following items:\n\n* **Combat Vehicle**: The TOS-1A combat vehicle is a highly mobile and armored platform, designed to carry and launch the 30-tube launcher. The vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated fire control system, allowing for accurate targeting and precise delivery of the warheads.\n* **30-Tube Launcher**: The 30-tube launcher is the primary component of the TOS-1A system, designed to launch the rockets equipped with incendiary and thermobaric warheads. The launcher is capable of launching multiple rockets in rapid succession, making it an ideal system for targeting and suppressing enemy strongpoints.\n* **Loading Vehicle**: The loading vehicle is designed to transport and load the rockets into the 30-tube launcher.

his first competitive century break at age 10, [3] and winning the British Under-16 Championship at age 13 [4] At the 1991 English Amateur Championship, aged 15 years and 98 days, he made his first competitive maximum break, then the youngest player ever to do so in a recognised tournament [5] In the same year, he won the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship and Junior Pot Black [6] [7]\n\n\nPlaying style\nKnown for his fast and attacking style of play, O'Sullivan gained the nickname \"The Rocket\" after winning a best-of-nine frame match in a record 43 minutes during his debut season as a professional [55] A prolific break builder and great tactical player, he has stated his disdain for long, drawn-out games, saying that they harm the game of snooker [56] O'Sullivan is ambidextrous, as he is right-handed but can play to a high standard with his left hand and routinely alternates when needed, enabling him to attempt shots with his left hand that would otherwise require a rest or spider [57] When he first displayed this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian accused him of disrespect and refused to shake hands after the match [14] [58]\n\n\nStatus\nO'Sullivan is highly regarded in snooker, with several of his peers regarding him as the greatest player ever, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] and some labelling him a \"genius\" [64] [65] After losing 17–6 to O'Sullivan in the 2008 World Championship semi-final, Hendry described him as \"the best player in the world by a country mile\" [66] In 2024, Hendry agreed that there was no longer any question as to whether O'Sullivan was the greatest snooker player of all time, also calling him an \"artist\" [67] However, O'Sullivan himself has dismissed the suggestion that he is the greatest player and has identified Hendry as the greatest due to his domination of snooker [68]\n\n\nCriticisms of snooker\nAfter Barry Hearn took charge of World Snooker in 2010, O'Sullivan became a vocal critic of how Hearn reconfigured the professional tour He took issue with increased travel expectations, flat 128 draws that required top professionals to play more rounds against lower ranked opponents, reduced prize money for maximum breaks, and tournament venues he saw as inadequate He accused snooker's governing body WPBSA of bullying and intimidating him, claimed that Hearn was running a \"dictatorship\", [79] protested alleged mistreatment by snooker's authorities by giving robotic or monosyllabic responses in interviews, [80] and refused opportunities to make maximum breaks in apparent protest over inadequate prize money for the achievement [81] In 2018, he threatened to form a breakaway snooker tour akin to the split in darts [82]\n\n\nOther endeavours\nEurosport signed an exclusive deal with O'Sullivan in March 2014 to make him its global ambassador for snooker, with the goal of driving its international appeal [86] As part of this deal, O'Sullivan created a special snooker series for the network called The Ronnie O'Sullivan Show, which included his insights into the game, interviews with other professional players, and playing tips

known professionally as Ronnie O'Sullivan, is a British professional snooker player. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, known for his exceptional skill, speed, and attacking style of play.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBorn on 5 December 1975 in Wordsley, West Midlands, O'Sullivan began playing snooker at the age of 7 and quickly developed a passion for the game. He won his first club tournament at the age of 9 and made his first competitive century break at the age of 10. O'Sullivan's natural talent and dedication to the sport led him to become a noted amateur competitor, and he eventually turned professional in 1992.\n\n**Career Summary**\n\nO'Sullivan's rapid rise to fame in the snooker world began in 1991, when he won the British Under-16 Championship at the age of 13. He made his first competitive maximum break in the 1991 English Amateur Championship, becoming the youngest player ever to achieve this feat in a recognized tournament. In the same year, he won the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship and Junior Pot Black.\n\nAs a professional, O'Sullivan has had an illustrious career, winning numerous titles, including six World Championships, seven UK Championships, and 37 ranking titles. He has also held the number one ranking in the world on six occasions and has been named the World Number One by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) on nine occasions.\n\n**Playing Style**\n\nO'Sullivan is known for his fast and attacking style of play, which has earned him the nickname \"The Rocket.\" He is a prolific break builder and a great tactical player, able to construct complex and high-scoring frames with ease. O'Sullivan has stated that he dislikes long, drawn-out games, believing that they harm the game of snooker.\n\nOne of O'Sullivan's unique skills is his ambidexterity, as he is able to play to a high standard with both his right and left hands. He has been known to alternate hands during matches, using his left hand to attempt shots that would otherwise require a rest or spider.\n\n**Status**\n\nO'Sullivan is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of snooker.

O'Sullivan has accused the governing body, the WPBSA, of bullying and intimidating him, and has claimed that Hearn is running a \"dictatorship.\"\n\nIn 2018, O'Sullivan threatened to form a breakaway snooker tour, similar to the split in darts. This move was seen as a response to his ongoing dissatisfaction with the professional snooker tour and its governing body.\n\n**Other Endeavours**\n\nIn addition to his professional snooker career, O'Sullivan has been involved in various other endeavours. In 2014, he signed an exclusive deal with Eurosport to become the network's global ambassador for snooker.

{"title": "SARS-CoV-2_Beta_variant", "content": "\nNames\nThe variant is also known as the South African variant.\n\n\nMutations\nFootnote: 1Presented in parent lineage B.1.\n\n\nVaccine efficacy\nOn 4 January 2021, UK newspaper The Telegraph reported that Oxford immunologist Sir John Bell believed there was \"a big question mark\" over the new South African variant's potential resistance to COVID-19 vaccines, raising fears that vaccines might not work as effectively on that variant strain [24] The same day Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand, commented to CBS News that \"it's not a given\" that the new Beta variant (501.V2 variant) would be able to evade the vaccines, but that it should be considered that they \"might not have the full efficacy\" [25] The additional mutations to the spike protein in Beta were raised as a concerning factor by Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, in that they \"may make the virus less susceptible to the immune response triggered by the vaccines\" [26] Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, also noted that the variant's multiple spike mutations \"could lead to some escape from immune protection\" [26]\n\n\nJanssen\nIn January, Johnson & Johnson, which held trials for its Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States, but 64% in South Africa [32] [33]\n\n\nPfizer–BioNTech\nOn 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced that

It was first discovered in South Africa in December 2020 and has since been detected in several other countries around the world.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe variant is also known as the South African variant.\n\n**Mutations**\n\nThe Beta variant has several mutations in the spike protein of the virus, including the E484K and K417N mutations. These mutations are thought to be responsible for the variant's increased transmissibility and ability to evade the immune system.\n\n**Vaccine efficacy**\n\nThe Beta variant has raised concerns about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. On January 4, 2021, UK newspaper The Telegraph reported that Oxford immunologist Sir John Bell believed there was \"a big question mark\" over the new South African variant's potential resistance to COVID-19 vaccines. The same day, Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand, commented that \"it's not a given\" that the new Beta variant would be able to evade the vaccines, but that it should be considered that they \"might not have the full efficacy.\"\n\nLawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, also noted that the variant's multiple spike mutations \"could lead to some escape from immune protection.\" Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, raised concerns that the additional mutations to the spike protein in Beta \"may make the virus less susceptible to the immune response triggered by the vaccines.\"\n\n**Janssen**\n\nIn January, Johnson & Johnson, which held trials for its Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States, but 64% in South Africa.\n\n**Pfizer-BioNTech**\n\nOn February 17, 2021, Pfizer announced that neutralisation activity was reduced by two thirds for the Beta variant, while refraining from making claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness as a result of this variant.\n\n**Oxford-AstraZeneca**\n\nOn February 6, 2021, The Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against the Beta variant.

Her father was stationed in Nuremberg, Germany, where he met her mother, and the family later returned to Arlington. Bullock's maternal grandfather was a German rocket scientist from Nuremberg. She has a younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, who served as the president of Bullock's production company, Fortis Films.\n\n**Career**\n\nBullock began her acting career in the late 1980s, taking acting classes with Sanford Meisner in New York. She appeared in several student films and landed a role in an Off-Broadway play, No Time Flat. Director Alan J Levi was impressed by Bullock's performance and offered her a part in the made-for-television film, Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989). This led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several independent films and in the lead role of the short-lived NBC television version of the film, Working Girl (1990).\n\n**Early Roles and Breakthrough (1987-1995)**\n\nWhile in New York, Bullock continued to take acting classes and appeared in several student films. She landed a role in the made-for-television film, Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989), which led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several independent films. In 1990, she starred in the lead role of the short-lived NBC television version of the film, Working Girl. Bullock went on to appear in several films, including Love Potion No 9 (1992), The Thing Called Love (1993), and Fire on the Amazon (1993), before her supporting role in the sci-fi action film, Demolition Man (1993).\n\n**Worldwide Recognition (1996-2007)**\n\nIn 1996, Bullock portrayed a member of the defense team in the trial for the murder of two men who raped a young girl in the legal drama, A Time to Kill, opposite Samuel L Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, and Kevin Spacey. She received an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Female Performance. Bullock subsequently received $11 million for Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997), which she agreed to star in for financial backing for her next project, Hope Floats (1998).

Instead, they gave their blessing to the notion of gamers \"inherit[ing] the storyline\", and The Matrix Online video game was billed as the official continuation. In February 2015, in interviews promoting Jupiter Ascending, Lilly Wachowski called a return to The Matrix a \"particularly repelling idea in these times\", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material. Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential reboot, said that they had not heard anything, but she believed that the studio might be looking to replace them. At various times, Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving have stated that they would be willing to reprise their roles in potential Matrix films, but only if the Wachowskis were involved.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions was a commercial success, but it received mixed reviews from critics.

football team**\n\nThe Mexico national football team represents Mexico in international football competitions. The team is controlled by the Mexican Football Federation (Federación Mexicana de Fútbol) and is one of the most successful teams in the CONCACAF region.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMexico has a rich football history, dating back to the early 20th century. The team has participated in numerous international tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup, CONCACAF Gold Cup, and CONCACAF Nations League. Mexico has a strong rivalry with the United States and Costa Rica, and has a significant following in Mexico and around the world.\n\n**History**\n\nFootball in Mexico was first organized in the early 20th century by European immigrant groups, notably miners from Cornwall, England, and in later years Spanish exiles fleeing the Spanish Civil War. In 1927, the official governing body of football in Mexico was founded. Mexico's first international tournament was the 1928 Summer Olympics, where the team lost to Spain 1-7 in the round of 16.\n\n**Early years**\n\nMexico did not appear again in a FIFA World Cup tournament until the 1950 World Cup. Before 1970, Mexico struggled to make much of an impact in the World Cup. However, goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal has the distinction of being the first player ever to appear in five consecutive World Cups.\n\n**Post-WWII**\n\nMexico was disqualified from the 1990 FIFA World Cup (and other international competitions) after using players over the age limit in the qualifying round for the 1989 FIFA Youth World Championship, known as the \"Cachirules\" scandal. The punishment was applied to all Mexico national representatives of all FIFA-sanctioned tournaments.\n\n**21st century**\n\nMexico was placed in Group G at the 2002 World Cup alongside Italy, Croatia, and Ecuador. Mexico started with a 1-0 win over Croatia and earned a 2-1 win over Ecuador. Mexico then achieved a 1-1 draw against Italy.

shed new light .. you will see Breaking Bad and the story of Breaking Bad in a different way\", comparing to its final season where Gilligan had \"start [ed] knocking things down and start [ed] lighting fires and burning everything down\" [13]\n\n\nCasting\nLaura Fraser confirmed weeks after the announcement of the premiere date that she was unable to reprise her role as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle

Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) would have resulted in all productions in the New Mexico film and television industry shutting down, including Better Call Saul [52] Odenkirk, Gould, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and several members of the New Mexico state legislature voiced their support for the IATSE and for creating better working conditions for the unionized crew

premiere \"Wine and Roses\" and \"Carrot and Stick\" received positive reviews from critics David Segal of The New York Times described the first episode as \"strong, twisty and gripping\" and said the writing \"must be hailed as a masterly curtain raiser, one that managed to pick up the story right where it was left, two years ago, and hurl it forward at a promising pace.\" Segal criticized Kim's con against Howard at the country club, calling it \"dimmer and daffier than the rest of the show\" and \"pointlessly cruel\" [93] Reviewing both \"Wine and Roses\" and \"Carrot and Stick\" together, The A.V Club's Kimberly Potts graded them with an \"A\" and gave positive notes to Gould's screenplay and the performances of the cast, especially those of Rhea Seehorn as Kim and Michael Mando as Nacho [94] Steve Greene, writing for IndieWire, said the first two episodes were \"astonishingly short on false moves so far\" He also noted Ed Begley Jr.'s acting as Clifford Main and the symbolism in Kim throwing away the \"World's 2nd Best Lawyer\" coffee mug, calling it \"a poetic bookend of sorts.\" [95] [96] David Segal of The New York Times described the second episode as \"superb and stressful\" and said it was a \"study in damage control, overseen by a man  [Gus] who seems uncharacteristically ruffled and uncertain about what to do.\" Segal also said the shootout scene was \"expertly staged\" by Gilligan and that Rhea Seehorn's performance as Kim provided an opportunity for her to \"demonstrate an almost thuggish toughness.\" [97] Scott Tobias, writing for Vulture, compared the motel sequences to the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, including Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) He also gave positive notes to the level of detail in the episode's opening scene, calling it \"one big reason Better Call Saul stands apart from other shows.\" [98]\n\n\nPart 2\nThe mid-season premiere \"Point and Shoot\", which concluded Lalo's arc, was met with critical acclaim It received five out of five from The Guardian's Stuart Jeffries and The Times's James Jackson, [106] [107] four out of five from Scott Tobias of Vulture, Nick Harley of Den of Geek,

lighting fires and burning everything down\" [13]\n\n\nCasting\nLaura Fraser confirmed weeks after the announcement of the premiere date that she was unable to reprise her role as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle

premiere \"Wine and Roses\" and \"Carrot and Stick\" received positive reviews from critics David Segal of The New York Times described the first episode as \"strong, twisty and gripping\" and said the writing \"must be hailed as a masterly curtain raiser, one that managed to pick up the story right where it was left, two years ago, and hurl it forward at a promising pace.\" Segal criticized Kim's con against Howard at the country club, calling it \"dimmer and daffier than the rest of the show\" and \"pointlessly cruel\" [93] Reviewing both \"Wine and Roses\" and \"Carrot and Stick\" together, The A.V Club's Kimberly Potts graded them with an \"A\" and gave positive notes to Gould's screenplay and the performances of the cast, especially those of Rhea Seehorn as Kim and Michael Mando as Nacho [94] Steve Greene, writing for IndieWire, said the first two episodes were \"astonishingly short on false moves so far\" He also noted Ed Begley Jr.'s acting as Clifford Main and the symbolism in Kim throwing away the \"World's 2nd Best Lawyer\" coffee mug, calling it \"a poetic bookend of sorts.\" [95] [96] David Segal of The New York Times described the second episode as \"superb and stressful\" and said it was a \"study in damage control, overseen by a man  [Gus] who seems uncharacteristically ruffled and uncertain about what to do.\" Segal also said the shootout scene was \"expertly staged\" by Gilligan and that Rhea Seehorn's performance as Kim provided an opportunity for her to \"demonstrate an almost thuggish toughness.\" [97] Scott Tobias, writing for Vulture, compared the motel sequences to the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, including Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) He also gave positive notes to the level of detail in the episode's opening scene, calling it \"one big reason Better Call Saul stands apart from other shows.\" [98]\n\n\nPart 2\nThe mid-season premiere \"Point and Shoot\", which concluded Lalo's arc, was met with critical acclaim It received five out of five from The Guardian's Stuart Jeffries and The Times's James Jackson, [106] [107] four out of five from Scott Tobias of Vulture, Nick Harley of Den of Geek,

It was held on 18-20 June 2021 at the Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, Var, France.\n\n# Background\n\nThe event, officially known as the Formula 1 Emirates Grand Prix de France 2021, took place at the Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, Var on the weekend of 18–20 June. The French Grand Prix returned to the calendar during the 2021 Formula One World Championship after the 2020 edition was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic; this was its 61st appearance on the world championship schedule, and the 89th edition overall. It was the seventeenth Grand Prix held at Le Castellet, one of sixteen different venues which have hosted the race since the 1906 French Grand Prix, seven of which have hosted world championship races.\n\n# Free Practice\n\nA trio of one-hour long free practice sessions took place, two on Friday and one on Saturday before qualifying. Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas was fastest in first practice, ahead of Hamilton and Verstappen. Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel made contact with a wall during the session, but was able to return his car to the pit lane. The front wing of Bottas's car was damaged when he hit a kerb, prompting Mercedes to lodge a complaint about its location, with sporting director Ron Meadows calling the kerbs \"too aggressive\". Ex-driver and BBC Sport pundit Jolyon Palmer argued that the fact they caused minor damage helped to enforce track limits, and that it is what fans wanted. Mick Schumacher's car was also damaged in an incident; the Haas driver lost control of his car and tagged a wall. Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz Jr's tyres were damaged by the abrasive run-off area after he went off the track.\n\n## Second Practice\n\nThe second practice session saw Verstappen take the lead, ahead of Bottas and Hamilton. The session was interrupted when Russell spun into the gravel trap, but was able to continue driving. Schumacher's car was damaged again, this time when he clipped a barrier. The session was also marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.\n\n## Third Practice\n\nThe third and final practice session saw Bottas take the lead, ahead of Verstappen and Hamilton. The session was marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound. The session was also interrupted when Latifi spun into the gravel trap, but was able to continue driving.\n\n# Qualifying\n\nQualifying started at 15:00 local time on the Saturday, in dry conditions at a temperature of 28.4°C (83.1°F). Qualifying consisted of three sessions, with the slowest five drivers having their qualifying positions set after each of the first two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was paused after AlphaTauri driver Yuki Tsunoda lost control of his car and hit a barrier, and then stopped with half a minute remaining on the clock when Schumacher crashed. His crash prevented some other drivers from having an opportunity to set a faster lap than him, allowing him to qualify fifteenth, the best result of his career up to that point. Stroll, who had had a lap time deleted after he went off the track at the sixth turn, was unable to set a representative lap time because of the premature conclusion to the session. Kimi Räikkönen and Nicholas Latifi were also unable to complete their final runs; Latifi qualified sixteenth with a time 0.002 seconds slower than his Williams teammate, Russell, in fifteenth. Nikita Mazepin qualified eighteenth after he was unable to keep pace with Haas teammate Schumacher. Verstappen set the fastest lap of the first session, with a time of 91.001 seconds.\n\n## Q2\n\nThe second part of qualifying (Q2) saw Verstappen take the lead, ahead of Bottas and Hamilton. The session was interrupted when Sainz went off the track, but was able to continue driving. The session was also marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.\n\n## Q3\n\nThe final part of qualifying (Q3) saw Verstappen take the lead, ahead of Bottas and Hamilton. The session was interrupted when Russell spun into the gravel trap, but was able to continue driving. The session was also marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.\n\n# Race\n\nThe race started at 15:00 local time on Sunday 20 June, running for 53 laps over a distance of 309.690 kilometres (192.432 mi). Tsunoda started the race from the pit lane because damaged parts of his car had been replaced after qualifying. Most of the field opted to start on the medium tyres, with six choosing the hard tyres. The weather was cooler for the race than it was for the free and qualifying practice sessions. It had rained on the morning of the race, removing rubber from the track and thus changing the driving conditions. The tarmac was rougher than it had been before, increasing the rate at which tyres would become worn out and lose grip. While cloud cover remained, the track had dried and it did not rain during the race. Conditions were also humid.\n\n## Early Racing\n\nThe first few laps of the race saw Verstappen take the lead, ahead of Bottas and Hamilton. The session was marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound. On lap 5, Sainz spun into the gravel trap, but was able to continue driving.\n\n## Mid-Race\n\nOn lap 20, Schumacher and Mazepin made contact, with Mazepin spinning into the gravel trap. The session was also marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.\n\n## Late Racing\n\nOn lap 40, Russell overtook Hamilton to take third place. The session was also marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.\n\n## Final Laps\n\nOn lap 50, Verstappen took the chequered flag, ahead of Bottas and Hamilton. The session was also marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe French Grand Prix was the 11th round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship. The event took place at the Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet, Var, France, on 18-20 June 2021. The race was won by Max Verstappen, who took the chequered flag on lap 53. The event was marked by a number of drivers struggling with tyre wear, with many opting to pit early to switch to a different compound.

{"title": "Mank", "content": "\nPlot\nIn 1940, Orson Welles is given complete creative freedom for his next project by RKO For the screenplay, Welles recruits Herman J Mankiewicz, who is in Victorville, California, recovering from a broken leg he sustained in a car crash Herman dictates the script to his secretary, Rita Alexander, who notices similarities between the main character (Charles Foster Kane) and William Randolph Hearst Producer John Houseman is concerned about Herman's dense, nonlinear screenplay, while Herman's brother Joseph worries that it may anger the powerful Hearst.\n\n\nCast\nMany other Hollywood icons are portrayed, including Dolores del Río, George S Kaufman, Lionel Barrymore, Greta Garbo, Josef von Sternberg, Norma Shearer, Eleanor Boardman, Joan Crawford, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Billie Dove, Rexford Tugwell, Bette Davis, Clark Gable, Charles MacArthur, Darryl F Zanuck, S J Perelman, Carole Lombard, and Eddie Cantor.\n\n\nProduction\nMank was officially announced in July 2019, when David Fincher said he would direct the film, with Gary Oldman set to star The screenplay was written by Fincher's father, Jack Fincher, prior to his death in 2003 It was originally going to be Fincher's follow-up to The Game (1997) with Kevin Spacey and Jodie Foster set to star but never came to fruition due to Fincher's insistence on shooting in black-and-white [8] [9] Additional casting was announced in October, with Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Tuppence Middleton, Arliss Howard, and Charles Dance among the new cast added

Fincher, prior to his death in 2003 It was originally going to be Fincher's follow-up to The Game (1997) with Kevin Spacey and Jodie Foster set to star but never came to fruition due to Fincher's insistence on shooting in black-and-white [8] [9] Additional casting was announced in October, with Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Tuppence Middleton, Arliss Howard, and Charles Dance among the new cast added [10]\n\n\nWriting\nThe 120-page draft of the initial script revealed that Jack Fincher closely followed a claim voiced by Pauline Kael in her 1971 New Yorker article \"Raising Kane\" that Welles did not deserve screenwriting credit [14] The article angered many critics, including Welles's friend and fellow filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich who rebutted Kael's claims point by point in \"The Kane Mutiny\", an October 1972 article for Esquire [15] Her argument was discredited by several film scholars through the years, including Robert L Carringer in his study of \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane.\" [16]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began on November 1, 2019, in Los Angeles [22] It also took place in Victorville, California, and wrapped on February 4, 2020 [23] The film was shot in black and white on Fincher's preferred RED digital camera and made reference to the aesthetics of Citizen Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland [24] Dance stated that a scene involving a drunken Mankiewicz took over 100 takes, [25] while Seyfried said that one of her scenes took over a week and 200 takes to shoot [26] She stated, \"It does feel like Groundhog Day, in a way, but that's how  [Fincher] captures things that most people don't.\" [25] The moonlight stroll between Mankiewicz and Davies was filmed at Huntington Gardens and a Pasadena mansion during the day, although it takes place at night This was done using the day for night technique Shooting it during the day was necessary for the lighting Messerschmidt needed for the scene [24]\n\n\nCostume design\nFor designing the costumes, costume designer Trish Summerville and production designer Donald Graham Burt used the noir and monochromatic filters on their iPhones to see how they would look in black and white Because the film was shot in black and white and not converted afterwards, it meant Summerville had to pick colors that would pop She looked at photos from 1930s Hollywood to see what was worn at the time [27]\n\n\nMusic\nFincher's frequent collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the score for Mank Forgoing their usual synth-heavy style, Reznor and Ross used period-authentic instrumentation from the 1940s to accompany the film [28] As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, each member of the orchestra recorded their sections for the score from home [29] The entire soundtrack is composed of songs written and performed by Reznor and Ross and runs for 52 tracks at over an hour and a half, [30] [31] and was released by The Null Corporation on December 4, 2020, the same day coinciding with the film's release [32] An extended soundtrack (featuring unreleased music and demos not featured in the film) that runs over three hours with 87 tracks, was released through Bandcamp the following week, December 11 [31] [33]\n\n\nRelease\nMank was released in a limited theatrical release in the United States on November 13, 2020, [20] before beginning to stream worldwide on

"article": "Mank\n\nMank is a 2020 American biographical drama film written and directed by David Fincher. The film is a fictionalized account of the development of Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane, with Gary Oldman playing the lead role of Herman J. Mankiewicz, the screenwriter of the film.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1940, Orson Welles is given complete creative freedom for his next project by RKO. For the screenplay, Welles recruits Herman J. Mankiewicz, who is in Victorville, California, recovering from a broken leg he sustained in a car crash. Herman dictates the script to his secretary, Rita Alexander, who notices similarities between the main character (Charles Foster Kane) and William Randolph Hearst. Producer John Houseman is concerned about Herman's dense, nonlinear screenplay, while Herman's brother Joseph worries that it may anger the powerful Hearst.\n\n## Cast\n\nMany other Hollywood icons are portrayed in the film, including Dolores del Río, George S. Kaufman, Lionel Barrymore, Greta Garbo, Josef von Sternberg, Norma Shearer, Eleanor Boardman, Joan Crawford, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Billie Dove, Rexford Tugwell, Bette Davis, Clark Gable, Charles MacArthur, Darryl F. Zanuck, S. J. Perelman, Carole Lombard, and Eddie Cantor.\n\n## Production\n\nMank was officially announced in July 2019, when David Fincher said he would direct the film, with Gary Oldman set to star. The screenplay was written by Fincher's father, Jack Fincher, prior to his death in 2003. It was originally going to be Fincher's follow-up to The Game (1997) with Kevin Spacey and Jodie Foster set to star but never came to fruition due to Fincher's insistence on shooting in black-and-white. Additional casting was announced in October, with Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Tuppence Middleton, Arliss Howard, and Charles Dance among the new cast added.\n\n## Development\n\nThe 120-page draft of the initial script revealed that Jack Fincher closely followed a claim voiced by Pauline Kael in her 1971 New Yorker article \"Raising Kane\" that Welles did not deserve screenwriting credit. The article angered many critics, including Welles's friend and fellow filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich who rebutted Kael's claims point by point in \"The Kane Mutiny\", an October 1972 article for Esquire. Her argument was discredited by several film scholars through the years, including Robert L. Carringer in his study of \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane.\"\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming began on November 1, 2019, in Los Angeles. It also took place in Victorville, California, and wrapped on February 4, 2020. The film was shot in black and white on Fincher's preferred RED digital camera and made reference to the aesthetics of Citizen Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland. Dance stated that a scene involving a drunken Mankiewicz took over 100 takes, while Seyfried said that one of her scenes took over a week and 200 takes to shoot. She stated, \"It does feel like Groundhog Day, in a way, but that's how [Fincher] captures things that most people don't.\" The moonlight stroll between Mankiewicz and Davies was filmed at Huntington Gardens and a Pasadena mansion during the day, although it takes place at night. This was done using the day for night technique. Shooting it during the day was necessary for the lighting Messerschmidt needed for the scene.\n\n## Costume design\n\nFor designing the costumes, costume designer Trish Summerville and production designer Donald Graham Burt used the noir and monochromatic filters on their iPhones to see how they would look in black and white. Because the film was shot in black and white and not converted afterwards, it meant Summerville had to pick colors that would pop. She looked at photos from 1930s Hollywood to see what was worn at the time.\n\n## Music\n\nFincher's frequent collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the score for Mank. Forgoing their usual synth-heavy style, Reznor and Ross used period-authentic instrumentation from the 1940s to accompany the film. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, each member of the orchestra recorded their sections for the score from home. The entire soundtrack is composed of songs written and performed by Reznor and Ross and runs for 52 tracks at over an hour and a half. The soundtrack was released by The Null Corporation on December 4, 2020, the same day coinciding with the film's release. An extended soundtrack (featuring unreleased music and demos not featured in the film) that runs over three hours with 87 tracks was released through Bandcamp the following week, December 11.\n\n## Release\n\nMank was released in a limited theatrical release in the United States on November 13, 2020, before beginning to stream worldwide on Netflix on December 4, 2020.\n\n## Reception\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of 351 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Sharply written and brilliantly performed, Mank peers behind the scenes of Citizen Kane to tell an old Hollywood story that could end up being a classic in its own right.\" According to Metacritic, which compiled 52 reviews and calculated a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, the film received \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n## Accolades\n\nMank received several awards and nominations, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama for Gary Oldman's performance.\n\n## See also\n\n* Citizen Kane\n* Orson Welles\n* Herman J.

{"title": "Golden_Globe_Awards", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) was founded in 1943 as the Hollywood Foreign Correspondent Association (HFCA) by Los Angeles–based foreign journalists seeking to develop a better-organized process of gathering and distributing cinema news to non-U.S markets [1] [2] [3] [4] One of the organization's first major endeavors was to establish a ceremony similar to the Academy Awards to honor film achievements The 1st Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, were held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.\n\n\nForeign Press Association of Hollywood's Henrietta Awards\nIn 1950, some of the journalists in the HFCA broke away to form the Foreign Press Association of Hollywood (FPAH) It was the FPAH that instituted the Henrietta Award for World Film Favorite, which was subsequently given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the new name for the organization when the FPAH and HFCA merged in 1955, minus the \"Henrietta\" name through 1980 (for the 1979 movie year) [1]\n\n\nPost-merger\nThe 13th Golden Globe Awards held in February 1956 saw the first Golden Globe in Television Achievement The first three permanent television award categories, Best TV Series, Best TV Actor, and Best TV Actress, then made their debuts during the 19th Golden Globe Awards held in March 1962.\n\n\nRevenues from award broadcast\nRevenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the HFPA to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals The most prominent beneficiary is the Young Artist Awards, presented annually by the Young Artist Foundation, established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member Maureen Dragone, to recognize and award excellence of young Hollywood performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged [9] [10] [11]\n\n\n2022 boycott, acquisition by Dick Clark Productions\nIn 2021, the HFPA faced criticism for the lack of Black representation among its members [12] On May 3, 2021, the HFPA announced plans for a reform package, including a 50% increase in members over the next 18 months, as well as new positions, term limits, and practices to improve its accountability [13] However, Time's Up and a group of 100 PR firms criticized the lack of given timelines for filling some of the new management positions, arguing that they would not be completed soon enough to have any material impact on the cycle of the upcoming 79th Golden Globe Awards in January 2022 Time's Up further argued that the package \"largely contains no specifics\" nor \"commitments to real accountability or change\" [14]\n\n\nRules\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31 [36]\n\n\nEligibility\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31 [36]\n\n\nNominations and voting\nEntry forms for films need to be received within ten days of the official screening TV programs should be submitted \"as early as possible\" before the deadline [36] For TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by voters in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.\n\n\nCeremony\nThe broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards, broadcast to 167 countries worldwide, generally ranks as the third most-watched awards show each year, behind only the Oscars and the Grammy Awards Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones Until Ricky Gervais hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major Hollywood award ceremonies (the other being the Screen Actors Guild Awards) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years [41] Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015 The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter Yoshiki Hayashi [citation needed]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe HFPA had previously held a lucrative broadcasting agreement with NBC, [42] which began televising the Golden Globes ceremony locally in Los Angeles in 1958, then nationally in 1964 However, in 1968, the Federal Communications Commission claimed the show \"misled the public as to how the winners were determined\" (allegations included that winners were determined by lobby; to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named) The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal Subsequently, NBC refused to broadcast the ceremony from 1968 until after 1974 [43] [44]\n\n\nCategories\nIn acting categories,

1950s, the HFPA had been racked by scandals and controversies The organization had been criticized for the small size of its membership, the quality of the members, its exclusion of serious cinema journalists, and their closeness to the movie industry and stars The Golden Globes under the HFPA were also accused of being bought or bartered, with the HFPA seemingly doling out nominations if not

that \"certain awards are being given more or less as  favors\" with others querying why so many winners were represented by one public relations firm [107]\n\n\nFCC broadcast ban\nThe FCC imposed a ban on NBC's broadcast of the Golden Globes after the February 1968 ceremony Movie critic Rex Reed, in a contemporary article about the broadcast, wrote:\n\n\nPia Zadora awarded \"New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture\" in 1982\nIn 1982, Pia Zadora won a Golden Globe in the category \"New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture\" for her performance in Butterfly, over such competition as Elizabeth McGovern (Ragtime) and Kathleen Turner (Body Heat) [109] Accusations were made that the Foreign Press Association members had been bought off [110] Zadora's husband, multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, flew voting members to his casino, the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film He also spent a great deal on advertising [111] [112] Furthermore, Zadora had made her film debut some 17 years earlier as a child performer in Santa Claus Conquers the Martians [113]\n\n\n2011 Payola Charges\nIn 2011, three days before the Golden Globe Awards telecast, publicist Michael Russell filed a $2 million lawsuit alleging that HFPA President Philip Berk terminated Russell and his partner's contract after the 2010 broadcast because they raised ethical concerns over payola with him, including allegations that HFPA members took bribes for nominations and awards  \n\"abuse their positions and engage in unethical and potentially unlawful deals and arrangements which amount to a 'payola' The lawsuit alleged that HFPA members  \"abuse their positions and engage in unethical and potentially unlawful deals and arrangements which amount to a 'payola' scheme\" scheme.\" The HFPA denied the allegations, claiming they were fabrications made up by a disgruntled ex-employee [114] The lawsuit was later settled.\n\n\nBurlesque and The Tourist for Best Musical/Comedy nominations in 2011\nThe nominations for the 2011 Golden Globes drew initial skepticism, as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated The Tourist in its Best Musical/Comedy categories, even though it was originally advertised as a spy thriller, along with being one of the most panned films of the season  Host Ricky Gervais even jokingly asked the main star of the film, Johnny Depp, if he had seen it Depp's co-star Angelina Jolie reportedly had personally lobbied HFPA members, resulting in a nomination in a category the film did not belong in [106] Rumors then surfaced that Sony, the distributor of The Tourist, had influenced Globes voters with an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, culminating in a concert by Cher [115] [116] The lobbying by Sony also resulted in a Best Musical/Comedy nod for Cher's badly-reviewed movie Burlesque [106]\n\n\nAsian films excluded from Best Motion Picture categories\nIn 2020, the HFPA received widespread criticism for nominating Asian and Asian American films, such as The Farewell, Parasite, and Minari, for Best Foreign Language Film while excluding them from the Best Motion Picture categories  The decision to categorize Minari as a foreign language film, despite having an exclusively American production team and setting, was heavily condemned by many actors and filmmakers of Asian descent [117] [118]  While HFPA rules stipulate that a film must have at least 50% English dialogue to be nominated for the Best Drama or Comedy/Musical categories, critics noted that the films Inglourious Basterds and Babel did not meet the 50% threshold but were still nominated for the Best Motion Picture categories, prompting accusations of anti-Asian racism [117]\n\n\nBlack representation\nIn the 2020s, the HFPA began to face criticism for the ethical standards of its operations—including allegations that the organization lacked accountability, and that there was a lack of Black representation among its members [119] Calls for reform in response to these issues resulted in the 79th Golden Globe Awards being boycotted by its broadcaster and other production companies; as a result, the ceremony was held as a non-televised, private event A televised ceremony returned the following year.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Golden Globe Awards**\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards are an annual American accolade bestowed by the Hollywood

Zadora's husband, multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, flew voting members to his casino, the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film.

The lawsuit was later settled.\n\n**Burlesque and The Tourist for Best Musical/Comedy nominations in 2011**\n\nThe nominations for the 2011 Golden Globes drew initial skepticism, as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated The Tourist in its Best Musical/Comedy categories, even though it was originally advertised as a spy thriller, along with being one of the most panned films of the season. Host Ricky Gervais even jokingly asked the main star of the film, Johnny Depp, if he had seen it. Depp's co-star Angelina Jolie reportedly had personally lobbied HFPA members, resulting in a nomination in a category the film did not belong in. Rumors then surfaced that Sony, the distributor of The Tourist, had influenced Globes voters with an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, culminating in a concert by Cher. The lobbying by Sony also resulted in a Best Musical/Comedy nod for Cher's badly-reviewed movie Burlesque.\n\n**Asian films excluded from Best Motion Picture categories**\n\nIn 2020, the HFPA received widespread criticism for nominating Asian and Asian American films, such as The Farewell, Parasite, and Minari, for Best Foreign Language Film while excluding them from the Best Motion Picture categories. The decision to categorize Minari as a foreign language film, despite having an exclusively American production team and setting, was heavily condemned by many actors and filmmakers of Asian descent. While HFPA rules stipulate that a film must have at least 50% English dialogue to be nominated for the Best Drama or Comedy/Musical categories, critics noted that the films Inglourious Basterds and Babel did not meet the 50% threshold but were still nominated for the Best Motion Picture categories, prompting accusations of anti-Asian racism.\n\n**Black representation**\n\nIn the 2020s, the HFPA began to face criticism for the ethical standards of its operations—including allegations that the organization lacked accountability, and that there was a lack of Black representation among its members. Calls for reform in response to these issues resulted in the 79th Golden Globe Awards being boycotted by its broadcaster and other production companies; as a result, the ceremony was held as a non-televised, private event. A televised ceremony returned the following year.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Golden_Globe_Awards\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) was founded in 1943 as the Hollywood Foreign Correspondent Association (HFCA) by Los Angeles–based foreign journalists seeking to develop a better-organized process of gathering and distributing cinema news to non-U.S markets [1] [2] [3] [4] One of the organization's first major endeavors was to establish a ceremony similar to the Academy Awards to honor film achievements The 1st Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, were held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.\n\n\nForeign Press Association of Hollywood's Henrietta Awards\nIn 1950, some of the journalists in the HFCA broke away to form the Foreign Press Association of Hollywood (FPAH) It was the FPAH that instituted the Henrietta Award for World Film Favorite, which was subsequently given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the new name for the organization when the FPAH and HFCA merged in 1955, minus the \"Henrietta\" name through 1980 (for the 1979 movie year) [1]\n\n\nPost-merger\nThe 13th Golden Globe Awards held in February 1956 saw the first Golden Globe in Television Achievement The first three permanent television award categories, Best TV Series, Best TV Actor, and Best TV Actress, then made their debuts during the 19th Golden Globe Awards held in March 1962.\n\n\nRevenues from award broadcast\nRevenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the HFPA to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals The most prominent beneficiary is the Young Artist Awards, presented annually by the Young Artist Foundation, established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member Maureen Dragone, to recognize and award excellence of young Hollywood performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged [9] [10] [11]\n\n\n2022 boycott, acquisition by Dick Clark Productions\nIn 2021, the HFPA faced criticism for the lack of Black representation among its members [12] On May 3, 2021, the HFPA announced plans for a reform package, including a 50% increase in members over the next 18 months, as well as new positions, term limits, and practices to improve its accountability [13] However, Time's Up and a group of 100 PR firms criticized the lack of given timelines for filling some of the new management positions, arguing that they would not be completed soon enough to have any material impact on the cycle of the upcoming 79th Golden Globe Awards in January 2022 Time's Up further argued that the package \"largely contains no specifics\" nor \"commitments to real accountability or change\" [14]\n\n\nRules\nThe qualifying eligibility period for all

countries worldwide, generally ranks as the third most-watched awards show each year, behind only the Oscars and the Grammy Awards Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones Until Ricky Gervais hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major Hollywood award ceremonies (the other being the Screen Actors Guild Awards) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years [41] Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015 The Golden Globe Awards' theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter Yoshiki Hayashi [citation needed]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe HFPA had previously held a lucrative broadcasting agreement with NBC, [42] which began televising the Golden Globes ceremony locally in Los Angeles in 1958, then nationally in 1964 However, in 1968, the Federal Communications Commission claimed the show \"misled the public as to how the winners were determined\" (allegations included that winners were determined by lobby; to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named) The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal Subsequently, NBC refused to broadcast the ceremony from 1968 until after 1974 [43] [44]\n\n\nCategories\nIn acting categories, Meryl Streep holds the record for the most competitive wins with

of scoring and passing skills helps her excel in the pick and roll [213] Her high turnover rate, in part due to her aggressive style of play and ball-handling usage, has been criticized [181] [214] Writers have likened Clark's talent and personality to Diana Taurasi [215] [216] Iowa head coach Lisa Bluder compared her to Sue Bird and Sabrina Ionescu [210] Clark has modeled parts of her game after Maya Moore, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Pete Maravich [6]\n\n\nThe \"Caitlin Clark effect\"\nWidely considered a generational talent, [217] Clark is described as one of the greatest women's college basketball players of all time by many publications [218] [219] [220] [221] In part due to her unprecedented shooting range and proficiency among female players, she has been labeled a transformative player in women's basketball [222] Her impact on the women's game is likened to that of Stephen Curry on the men's game [223] USA Today stated that she, like Curry, has \"redefined what a good shot is in basketball.\" [224] The Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Gay wrote in 2024: \"Clark is far from the first great shooter in women's basketball, but she's the one who is changing the dimensionality of the game, because of the distance she can shoot from and how well she can pass.\" [225]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nStats current through end of 2024 season\n\n\nWNBA\nStats current

Her career spans over three decades, with notable achievements in reporting on presidential trips and interviews with former US presidents and their families. Malveaux's personal life is equally fascinating, with a diverse family background and a strong academic lineage.\n\n# Early Life and Education\n\nSuzanne Malveaux was born in Lansing, Michigan, into a New Orleans-based family with roots in Louisiana Creole culture. Her parents, Floyd Joseph Malveaux and Myrna Maria Ruiz, were both of Louisiana Creole origin, with their ancestry tracing back to French, Spanish, and African descent. Malveaux's family history is complex, with different members identifying as white, biracial, and/or black. Malveaux herself considers herself black.\n\nMalveaux's father, Floyd, was a doctor who became the dean of the College of Medicine at Howard University. He was also the executive director of the Merck Childhood Asthma Network and a founder of Howard University's National Human Genome Center. Her mother, Myrna, is a retired schoolteacher. The family's diverse heritage is reflected in Malveaux's own ancestry, which includes a 17th-century French-Canadian fur trader from Quebec, a seventh-great-grandmother from the Kaskaskia tribe, and a free black man who owned slaves in Louisiana.\n\n# Career\n\nMalveaux's first television job was with New England Cable News as a general assignment reporter in Boston, from 1992 to 1996. During her time at New England Cable News, Malveaux covered a wide range of stories, including local news, politics, and crime. In 1996, she moved to Washington, D.C., and joined NBC affiliate WRC-TV, where she worked as a self-described \"rock-and-roll\" reporter. Malveaux's time at WRC-TV was marked by her energetic and engaging reporting style, which earned her a reputation as a skilled and versatile journalist.\n\nIn 1999, Malveaux joined CNN as a White House correspondent, a position she has held for over two decades. As a White House correspondent, Malveaux has interviewed former presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, as well as former first lady Laura Bush.

In 2022, Malveaux traveled to Ukraine, where she reported from Lviv as Russia's invasion of the country continued. Her reporting from the front lines of the conflict provided critical insights into the situation on the ground and the impact of the conflict on the local population.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nMalveaux has three siblings, including an identical twin, Suzette M. Malveaux, who is a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. Malveaux's family is also connected to Julianne Malveaux, a columnist and former president of Bennett College, who is a distant cousin.\n\nMalveaux's personal life is marked by a strong commitment to her family and her community. Her family's diverse heritage and her own experiences as a black woman have informed her reporting and shaped her perspective as a journalist.

{"title": "Pope_John_Paul_II", "content": "\nEarly life\nKarol Józef Wojtyła was born in the Polish town of Wadowice [20] [21] He was the youngest of three children born to Karol Wojtyła (1879–1941), an ethnic Pole, and Emilia Kaczorowska (1884–1929), who was of distant Lithuanian heritage [22] Emilia, who was a schoolteacher, died from a heart attack and kidney failure in 1929 [23] when Wojtyła was eight years old [24] His elder sister Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior Edmund's work as a physician eventually led to his death from scarlet fever, a loss that affected Wojtyła deeply [22] [24]\n\n\nPriesthood\nAfter finishing his studies at the seminary in Kraków, Wojtyła was ordained as a priest on All Saints' Day, 1 November 1946, [23] by the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha [21] [51] [52] Sapieha sent Wojtyła to Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, to study under the French Dominican friar Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange beginning on 26 November 1946 He resided in the Belgian Pontifical College during this time, under rectorship of Maximilien de Furstenberg [53] Wojtyła earned a licence in July 1947, passed his doctoral exam on 14 June 1948, and successfully defended his doctoral thesis titled Doctrina de fide apud S Ioannem a Cruce (The Doctrine of Faith in St John of the Cross) in philosophy on 19 June 1948 [54] The Angelicum preserves the original copy of Wojtyła's typewritten thesis [55] Among other courses at the Angelicum, Wojtyła studied Hebrew with the Dutch Dominican Peter G Duncker, author of the Compendium grammaticae linguae hebraicae biblicae [56]\n\n\nEpiscopate and cardinalate\nOn 4 July 1958, [52] while Wojtyła was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, Pope Pius XII appointed him as an auxiliary bishop of Kraków He was consequently summoned to Warsaw to meet the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, who informed him of his appointment [70] [71] Wojtyła accepted the appointment as auxiliary bishop to Kraków's Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak, and he received episcopal consecration (as titular bishop of Ombi) on 28 September 1958, with Baziak as the principal consecrator and as co-consecrators Bishop Bolesław Kominek (titular bishop of Sophene), auxiliary of the Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław, and Franciszek Jop, Auxiliary Bishop of Sandomierz (Titular Bishop of Daulia) Kominek was to become Cardinal Archbishop of Wrocław and Jop was later Auxiliary Bishop of Wrocław and then Bishop of Opole [52] At the age of 38, Wojtyła became the youngest bishop in Poland.\n\n\nCall to the episcopate\nOn 4 July 1958, [52] while Wojtyła was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, Pope Pius XII appointed him as an auxiliary bishop of Kraków He was consequently summoned to Warsaw to meet the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, who informed him of his appointment [70] [71] Wojtyła accepted the appointment as auxiliary bishop to Kraków's Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak, and he received

Bishop of Wrocław and then Bishop of Opole [52] At the age of 38, Wojtyła became the youngest bishop in Poland.\n\n\nParticipation in Vatican II and subsequent events\nFrom October 1962, Wojtyła took part in the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), [20] [52] where he made contributions to two of its most historic and influential products, the Decree on Religious Freedom (in Latin, Dignitatis humanae) and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes) [52] Wojtyła and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Council for Gaudium et spes According to the Jesuit historian John W O'Malley, the draft text Gaudium et spes that Wojtyła and the Polish delegation sent \"had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text\" [73] According to John F Crosby, as pope, John Paul II used the words of Gaudium et spes later to introduce his own views on the nature of the human person in relation to God: man is \"the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake\", but man \"can fully discover his true self only in a sincere giving of himself\" [74]\n\n\nPapacy\nIn August 1978, following the death of Pope Paul VI, Wojtyła voted in the papal conclave, which elected John Paul I John Paul I died after only 33 days as pope, triggering another conclave [21] [52] [84]\n\n\nElection\nIn August 1978, following the death of Pope Paul VI, Wojtyła voted in the papal conclave, which elected John Paul I John Paul I died after only 33 days as pope, triggering another conclave [21] [52] [84]\n\n\nPastoral journeys\nDuring his pontificate, John Paul II made journeys to 129 countries, [94] travelling more than 1,100,000 kilometres (680,000 mi) while doing so He consistently attracted large crowds, some among the largest ever assembled in human history, such as the Manila World Youth Day 1995, which gathered up to four million people, the largest papal gathering ever, according to the Vatican [95] [96] John Paul II's earliest official visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979 [97] While some of his journeys (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were to places previously visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by President Jimmy Carter He was the first pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico [98] and Ireland [99] He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England While in Britain he also visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the spot where Thomas Becket had been killed, [100] as well as holding several large-scale open air masses, including one at Wembley Stadium, which was attended by some 80,000 people [101]\n\n\nWorld Youth Days\nAs an extension of his successful work with youth as a young priest, John Paul II pioneered the international World Youth Days John Paul II presided over nine of them: Rome (1985 and 2000), Buenos Aires (1987), Santiago de Compostela (1989), Częstochowa (1991), Denver (1993), Manila (1995), Paris (1997), and Toronto (2002) Total attendance at these signature events of the pontificate was in the tens of millions [113]\n\n\nDedicated Years\nKeenly aware of the rhythms of time and the importance of anniversaries in the Catholic Church's life, John Paul II led nine \"dedicated years\" during the twenty-six and a half years of his pontificate: the Holy Year of the Redemption in 1983–84, the Marian Year in 1987–88, the Year of the Family in 1993–94, the three Trinitarian years of preparation for the Great Jubilee of 2000, the Great Jubilee itself, the Year of the Rosary in 2002–3, and the Year of the Eucharist, which began on 17 October 2004, and concluded six months after the Pope's death [113]\n\n\nMusic albums\nJohn Paul II recorded music albums In 1979, his album Pope John Paul II sings at the Festival of Sacrosong was recorded by Infinity Records [114] [115] In 1994 he released a music album title The Rosary [116] In 1999, John Paul II released another music album titled Abba Pater [117]\n\n\nGreat Jubilee of 2000\nThe Great Jubilee of 2000 was a call to the church to become more aware and to embrace her missionary task for the work of evangelization.\n\n\nTeachings\nAs pope, John Paul II wrote 14 papal encyclicals and taught about sexuality in what is referred as the \"Theology of the Body\" Some key elements of his strategy to \"reposition the Catholic Church\" were encyclicals such as Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Reconciliatio et paenitentia and Redemptoris Mater In his At the beginning of the new millennium (Novo Millennio Ineunte), he emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" In The Splendour of the Truth (Veritatis Splendor), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law (\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth\" He warned that man \"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself\" In Fides et Ratio (On the Relationship between Faith and Reason) John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason, and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: Laborem exercens, Sollicitudo rei socialis, and Centesimus annus Through his encyclicals and many Apostolic Letters and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the dignity and the equality of women [123] He argued for the importance of the family for the future of humanity [76]\n\n\nSocial and political stances\nJohn Paul II was considered a conservative on doctrine and issues relating to human sexual reproduction and the ordination of women [124] While he was visiting the United States in 1977, the year before becoming pope, Wojtyła said: \"All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred.\" [125]\n\n\nApartheid in South Africa\nJohn Paul II was an outspoken opponent of apartheid in South Africa In 1985, while visiting the Netherlands, he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the International Court of Justice, proclaiming that \"No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.\" [131] In September 1988, John Paul II made a pilgrimage to ten Southern African countries, including those bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa During his visit to Zimbabwe, John Paul II called for economic sanctions against South Africa's government [132] After John Paul II's death, both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised the pope for defending human rights and condemning economic injustice [133]\n\n\nCapital punishment\nJohn Paul II was an outspoken opponent of the death penalty, which was a break from previous popes regarding the practise At a papal mass in St Louis, Missouri, in the United States he said:\n\n\nEnvironment and ecology\nJohn Paul II taught on the environmental health of Earth that \"humanity has disappointed God's expectations .. degrading that 'flowerbed' which is the earth, our dwelling-place\" [138] His phrase and exhortation, \"ecological conversion\", which was used in a general audience in The Vatican in 2001, [138] has been widely adopted, for example in the Mandate for Catholic Earthcare Australia, [139] and in the writings of Pope Francis [140]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nJohn Paul II pushed for a reference to Europe's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the European Constitution In his 2003 apostolic exhortation Ecclesia in Europa, John Paul II wrote that he \"fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions\" However, he wanted the constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a \"structured dialogue\" between each religious community and the European Union (EU), and extend across the EU the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states John Paul II said: \"I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe.\" The pope's desire for a reference to Europe's Christian identity in the EU Constitution was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the Church of England and Eastern Orthodox Churches from Russia, Romania, and Greece [141] John Paul II's demand to include a reference to Europe's Christian roots in the European Constitution was supported by some non-Christians, such as Joseph Weiler, a practising Orthodox Jew and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the EU Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a \"demonstration of neutrality\" but rather \"a Jacobin attitude\" [142]\n\n\nEvolution\nOn 22 October 1996, in a speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences plenary session at the Vatican, John Paul II said of evolution that \"this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favour of this theory.\" John Paul II's embrace of evolution was enthusiastically praised by American palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, [145] with whom he had an audience in 1984 [146]\n\n\nIraq War\nIn 2003 John Paul II criticised the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq, saying in his State of the World address \"No to war! War is not always inevitable It is always a defeat for humanity.\" [150] He sent Cardinal Pio Laghi, the former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States, to talk with George W Bush, the US president, to express opposition to the war John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law The pope's opposition to the Iraq War led to him being a candidate to win the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, which was ultimately awarded to Iranian attorney/judge and noted human rights advocate Shirin Ebadi [151] [152]\n\n\nLiberation theology\nIn 1984 and 1986, through Cardinal Ratzinger (future Pope Benedict XVI) as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, John Paul II officially condemned aspects of liberation theology, which had many followers in Latin America [153]\n\n\nOrganised crime\nJohn Paul II was the first pontiff to denounce Mafia violence in Southern Italy In 1993, during a pilgrimage to Agrigento, Sicily, he appealed to the Mafiosi: \"I say to those responsible: 'Convert! One day, the judgement of God will arrive!'\" In 1994, John Paul II visited Catania and told victims of Mafia violence to \"rise up and cloak yourself in light and justice!\" [160]\n\n\nPersian Gulf War\nBetween 1990 and 1991, a 34-nation coalition led by the United States waged a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait John Paul II was a staunch opponent of the Gulf War Throughout the conflict, he appealed to the international community to stop the war, and after it was over led diplomatic initiatives to negotiate peace in the Middle East [162] In his 1991 encyclical Centesimus annus, John Paul II harshly condemned the conflict:\n\n\nRwandan genocide\nIn 1990, during the civil war between Tutsis and Hutus in the mostly Catholic country of Rwanda, John Paul II called for a ceasefire and condemned the persecution of the Tutsis [165] In 1994, he was the first world leader to condemn the massacre of the Tutsis as a genocide In 1995, during his third visit to Kenya before an audience of 300,000, John Paul II pleaded for an end to the violence in Rwanda and Burundi, urging forgiveness and reconciliation as a solution to the genocide He told Rwandan and Burundian refugees that he \"was close to them and shared their immense pain\" He said:\n\n\nViews on sexuality\nWhile taking a traditional position on human sexuality, maintaining the Catholic Church's moral opposition to homosexual acts, John Paul II asserted that people with homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as others [167] In his book Memory and Identity, he referred to the \"strong pressures\" by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: \"It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family.\" [76] [168]\n\n\nReform of canon law\nJohn Paul II completed a full-scale reform of the Catholic Church's legal system, Latin and Eastern, and a reform of the Roman Curia.\n\n\n1983 Code of Canon Law\nOn 25 January 1983, with the apostolic constitution Sacrae disciplinae leges John Paul II promulgated the current code of canon law for all members of the Catholic Church who belonged to the Latin Church It entered into force the first Sunday of the following Advent, [172] which was 27 November 1983 [173] John Paul II described the new code as \"the last document of Vatican II\" [172] Edward N Peters has referred to the 1983 Code as the \"Johanno-Pauline Code\" [174] (Johannes Paulus is Latin for \"John Paul\"), parallelling the \"Pio-Benedictine\" 1917 code that it replaced.\n\n\nCode of Canons of the Eastern Churches\nJohn Paul II promulgated the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO) on 18 October 1990, by the document Sacri Canones [175] The CCEO came into force of law on 1 October 1991 [176] It is the codification of the common portions of the canon law for the 23 of the 24 sui iuris churches in the Catholic Church that are the Eastern Catholic Churches It is divided into 30 titles and has a total of 1540 canons [177]\n\n\nPastor bonus\nJohn Paul II promulgated the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus on 28 June 1988 It instituted a number of reforms in the process of running the Roman Curia Pastor bonus laid out in considerable detail the organisation of the Roman Curia, specifying precisely the names and composition of each dicastery, and enumerating the competencies of each dicastery It replaced the previous special law, Regimini Ecclesiæ universæ, which was promulgated by Paul VI in 1967 [178]\n\n\nCatechism of the Catholic Church\nOn 11 October 1992, in his apostolic constitution Fidei depositum (The Deposit of Faith), John Paul ordered the publication of the Catechism of the Catholic Church [179] [180]\n\n\nSouth American and Caribbean dictatorships\nAccording to Joaquín Navarro-Valls, John Paul II's press secretary:\n\n\nChile\nBefore John Paul II's pilgrimage to Latin America, during a meeting with reporters, he criticised Augusto Pinochet's regime as \"dictatorial\" In the words of The New York Times, he used \"unusually strong language\" to criticise Pinochet and asserted to journalists that the Catholic Church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile [182]\n\n\nHaiti\nJohn Paul II visited Haiti on 9 March 1983, when the country was ruled by Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier He bluntly criticised the poverty of the country, directly addressing Baby Doc and his wife, Michèle Bennett in front of a large crowd of Haitians:\n\n\nParaguay\nThe collapse of the dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay was linked, among other things, to John Paul II's visit to the South American country in May 1988 [192] Since Stroessner's taking power through a coup d'état in 1954, Paraguay's bishops increasingly criticised the regime for human rights abuses, rigged elections, and the country's feudal economy During his private meeting with Stroessner, John Paul II told the dictator:\n\n\nRole in the fall of Communism\nBy the late 1970s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union had been predicted by some observers [194] [195] John Paul II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, [76] [90] [94] [111] [112] [196] by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for \"a peaceful revolution\" in Poland Lech Wałęsa, the founder of Solidarity and the first post-Communist President of Poland, credited John Paul II with giving Poles the courage to demand change [76] According to Wałęsa, \"Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs Nobody knew how to get rid of Communism In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land .. this land'.\" [196] It has also been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank covertly funded Solidarity [197] [198]\n\n\nRole as spiritual inspiration and catalyst\nBy the late 1970s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union had been predicted by some observers [194] [195] John Paul II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, [76] [90] [94] [111] [112] [196] by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for \"a peaceful revolution\" in Poland Lech Wałęsa, the founder of Solidarity and the first post-Communist President of Poland, credited John Paul II with giving Poles the courage to demand change [76] According to Wałęsa, \"Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs Nobody knew how to get rid of Communism In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land .. this land'.\" [196] It has also been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank covertly funded Solidarity [197] [198]\n\n\nCommunist attempt to compromise John Paul II\nIn 1983, Poland's Communist government unsuccessfully tried to humiliate John Paul II by falsely saying he had fathered an illegitimate child Section D of Służba Bezpieczeństwa (SB), the security service, had an action named \"Triangolo\" to carry out criminal operations against the Catholic Church in Poland; the operation encompassed all Polish hostile actions against the pope [205] [better source needed] Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski, one of the murderers of beatified Jerzy Popiełuszko, was the leader of section D They drugged Irena Kinaszewska, the secretary of the Kraków-based weekly Catholic magazine Tygodnik Powszechny where Wojtyła had worked, and unsuccessfully attempted to make her admit to having had sexual relations with him [206]\n\n\nRelations with other Christian denominations\nJohn Paul II travelled extensively and met with believers from many divergent faiths At the World Day of Prayer for Peace, held in Assisi on 27 October 1986, more than 120 representatives of different religions and denominations spent a day of fasting and prayer [207]\n\n\nChurches of the East\nAlthough the contact between the Holy See and many Christians of the East had never totally ceased, communion had been interrupted since ancient times Again, the history of conflict in Central Europe was a complex part of John Paul II's personal cultural heritage which made him all the more determined to react so as to attempt to overcome abiding difficulties, given that relatively speaking the Holy See and the non-Catholic Eastern Churches are close in many points of faith.\n\n\nEastern Orthodox Church\nIn May 1999, John Paul II visited Romania on the invitation from Patriarch Teoctist Arăpaşu of the Romanian Orthodox Church This was the first time a pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the Great Schism in 1054 [208] On his arrival, the Patriarch and the President of Romania, Emil Constantinescu, greeted the pope [208] The Patriarch stated, \"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity.\" [208]\n\n\nArmenian Apostolic Church\nJohn Paul II was determined to maintain good relations with the Armenian Apostolic Church, whose separation from the Holy See dated to Christian antiquity In 1996, he brought the Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church closer by agreeing with Armenian Archbishop Karekin II on Christ's nature [213] During an audience in 2000, John Paul II and Karekin II, by then the Catholicos of All Armenians, issued a joint statement condemning the Armenian genocide Meanwhile, the pope gave Karekin the relics of St Gregory the Illuminator, the first head of the Armenian Church that had been kept in Naples, Italy, for 500 years [214] In September 2001, John Paul II went on a three-day pilgrimage to Armenia to take part in an ecumenical celebration with Karekin II in the newly consecrated Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan The two Church leaders signed a declaration remembering the victims of the Armenian genocide [215]\n\n\nProtestantism\nLike his successors after him, John Paul II took a large number of initiatives to promote friendly relations, practical humanitarian cooperation and theological dialogue with a range of Protestant bodies Of these the first in importance had to be with Lutheranism, given that the contention with Martin Luther and his followers was the most significant historical split in Western Christianity [citation needed]\n\n\nLutheranism\nFrom 15 to 19 November 1980, John Paul II visited West Germany [216] on his first trip to a country with a large Lutheran Protestant population In Mainz, he met with leaders of the Protestant Church in Germany, and with representatives of other Christian denominations [citation needed]\n\n\nAnglicanism\nJohn Paul II had good relations with the Church of England, as also with other parts of the Anglican Communion He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England He preached in Canterbury Cathedral and received Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury He said that he was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to ordain women and saw it as a step away from unity between the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church [219]\n\n\nRelations with Judaism\nRelations between Catholicism and Judaism improved dramatically during the pontificate of John Paul II [76] [106] He spoke frequently about the Catholic Church's relationship with the Jewish faith [76] It is likely that his attitude was shaped in part by his own experience of the terrible fate of the Jews in Poland and the rest of Central Europe in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\nRelations with other world religions\nIn his book-length interview Crossing the Threshold of Hope with the Italian journalist Vittorio Messori published in 1995, John Paul II draws parallels between animism and Christianity He wrote:\n\n\nAnimism\nIn his book-length interview Crossing the Threshold of Hope with the Italian journalist Vittorio Messori published in 1995, John Paul II draws parallels between animism and Christianity He wrote:\n\n\nBuddhism\nTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, visited John Paul II eight times The two men held many similar views and understood similar plights, both coming from nations affected by Communism and both serving as heads of major religious bodies [235] [236] As Archbishop of Kraków, long before the 14th Dalai Lama was a world-famous figure, Wojtyła held special Masses to pray for the Tibetan people's non-violent struggle for freedom from Maoist China [237] In 1987, he welcomed participants of the East-West Spiritual Exchanges, an initiative by the Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (DIMMID) and the Institute for Zen Studies in which Buddhist and Christian monks or nuns take turns residing for one month in each other's monasteries [238] [239] During his 1995 visit to Sri Lanka, a country where a majority of the population adheres to Theravada Buddhism, John Paul II expressed his admiration for Buddhism He said:\n\n\nIslam\nJohn Paul II made considerable efforts to improve relations between Catholicism and Islam [241]\n\n\nJainism\nIn 1995, John Paul II held a meeting with 21 Jains, organised by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue He praised Mohandas Gandhi for his \"unshakeable faith in God\", assured the Jains that the Catholic Church will continue to engage in dialogue with their religion and spoke of the common need to aid the poor The Jain leaders were impressed with the pope's \"transparency and simplicity\", and the meeting received much attention in the Gujarat state in western India, home to many Jains [249]\n\n\nAssassination attempts and plots\nAs he entered St Peter's Square to address an audience on 13 May 1981, [250] John Paul II was shot and critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca, [20] [94] [251] an expert Turkish gunman who was a member of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves [252] The assassin used a Browning 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, [253] shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times [90] John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness Even though the two bullets missed his superior mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds [254] Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal [254] When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation [255] One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends, philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery [81] The pope later stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal [94] [251] [256] He said:\n\n\nApologies\nJohn Paul II apologised to many groups that had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church through the years [76] [269] Before becoming pope he had been a prominent editor and supporter of initiatives such as the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops from 1965 As pope, he officially made public apologies for over 100 wrongdoings, including: [270] [271] [272] [273]\n\n\nHealth\nWhen he became pope in 1978 at the age of 58, John Paul II was an avid sportsman He was extremely healthy and active, jogging in the Vatican gardens, weight training, swimming, and hiking in the mountains He was fond of football The media contrasted the new pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been Pope Pius XI (1922–1939), who was an avid mountaineer [277] [278] An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the keep-fit pope.\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nJohn Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout of influenza on 1 February 2005 [280] He left the hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently hospitalised again with breathing problems two weeks later and underwent a tracheotomy [281]\n\n\nFinal months\nJohn Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout of influenza on 1 February 2005 [280] He left the hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently hospitalised again with breathing problems two weeks later and underwent a tracheotomy [281]\n\n\nFinal illness and death\nOn 31 March 2005, following a urinary tract infection, [282] he developed septic shock, a form of infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised Instead, he was monitored by a team of consultants at his private residence This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican [282] Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, visited him at his bedside [79] [283] During the final days of the pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: \"I have searched for you, and now you have come to me, and I thank you.\" [284]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe death of the pontiff set in motion rituals and traditions dating back to medieval times The Rite of Visitation took place from 4 April 2005 to 7 April 2005 at St Peter's Basilica John Paul II's testament, published on 7 April 2005, [291] revealed that he contemplated being buried in his native Poland but left the final decision to the College of Cardinals, which in passing, preferred burial beneath St Peter's Basilica, honouring the pontiff's request to be placed \"in bare earth\".\n\n\nPosthumous recognition\nUpon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen [90] [274] [297] began referring to the late pontiff as \"John Paul the Great\" — in theory only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed [90] [297] [298] [299] Cardinal Angelo Sodano specifically referred to John Paul as \"the Great\" in his published written homily for the pope's funeral Mass of Repose [300] [301] The South African Catholic newspaper The Southern Cross has referred to him in print as \"John Paul II the Great\" [302] Some Catholic educational institutions in the US have additionally changed their names to incorporate \"the Great\", including John Paul the Great Catholic University and schools called some variant of John Paul the Great High School.\n\n\nTitle \"the Great\"\nUpon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen [90] [274] [297] began referring to the late pontiff as \"John Paul the Great\" — in theory only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed [90] [297] [298]

including John Paul the Great Catholic University and schools called some variant of John Paul the Great High School.\n\n\nInstitutions named after John Paul II\nInspired by calls of \"Santo Subito!\" (\" [Make him a] Saint Immediately!\") from the crowds gathered during the funeral Mass that he celebrated, [314] [315] [316] [317] Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, bypassing the normal restriction that five years must pass after a person's death before beginning the beatification process [315] [316] [318] [319] In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome, who was responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who died within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\", which suggested that the waiting period could be waived [21] [274] [320] This decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St Peter's Square [321]\n\n\nBeatification\nInspired by calls of \"Santo Subito!\" (\" [Make him a] Saint Immediately!\") from the crowds gathered during the funeral Mass that he celebrated, [314] [315] [316] [317] Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, bypassing the normal restriction that five years must pass after a person's death before beginning

May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St Peter's Square [321]\n\n\nCanonisation\nTo be eligible for canonisation (being declared a saint) by the Catholic Church, two miracles must be attributed to a candidate.\n\n\nBeatification of the Pope's parents\nOn 10 October 2019, the Archdiocese of Kraków and the Polish Episcopal Conference approved nihil obstat the opening of the beatification cause of the parents of its patron saint John Paul II, Karol Wojtyła Sr and Emilia Kaczorowska It gained approval from the Holy See to open the diocesan phase of the cause on 7 May 2020 [356]\n\n\nSexual abuse scandals\nJohn Paul II was criticised by representatives of the victims of clergy sexual abuse for failing to respond quickly enough to the Catholic sex abuse crisis [357] After decades of inaction, the scandal came to a head when Sinéad O'Connor infamously tore up a photo of John Paul II on a 3 October 1992 episode of Saturday Night Live while performing an a capella rendition of Bob Marley's \"War\" [358]\n\n\nOther criticism and controversy\nJohn Paul II was widely criticised for a variety of his views He was a target of criticism from progressives for his opposition to the ordination of women and use of contraception, [20] [381] and from traditional Catholics for his support for the Second Vatican Council and its reform of the liturgy John Paul II's response to child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church has also come under heavy censure.\n\n\nOpus Dei controversies\nJohn Paul II was criticised for his support of the Opus Dei prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, Josemaría Escrivá, whom he called \"the saint of ordinary life\" [382] [383] Other movements and religious organisations of the church went decidedly under his wing Legion of Christ, the Neocatechumenal Way, Schoenstatt, the charismatic movement, etc And he was accused repeatedly of taking a soft hand with them, especially in the case of Marcial Maciel, founder of the Legionaries of Christ [384]\n\n\nBanco Ambrosiano scandal\nJohn Paul II was alleged to have links with Banco Ambrosiano, an Italian bank that collapsed in 1982 [197] At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, Roberto Calvi, and his membership in the illegal Masonic Lodge Propaganda Due (aka P2) The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of John Paul I in 1978 is rumoured to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal [198]\n\n\nProblems with traditionalists\nIn addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, some traditionalist Catholics denounced him as well These issues included demanding a return to the Tridentine Mass, [389] as well as the repudiation of reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin-language Roman Rite, ecumenism, and the principle of religious liberty [390] In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of Saint Pius X (1970), was excommunicated under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which Cardinal Ratzinger called a \"schismatic act\" [391]\n\n\nReligion and AIDS\nJohn Paul II continued the tradition of advocating for the culture of life In solidarity with Pope Paul VI's Humanae vitae, he rejected artificial birth control, even in the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS [381] Critics have said that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate Third World poverty and problems, such as street children in South America John Paul II argued that the proper way to prevent the spread of AIDS was not condoms but rather \"correct practice of sexuality, which presupposes chastity and fidelity\" [381] The focus of John Paul II's point is that the need for artificial birth control is itself artificial, and that principle of respecting the sacredness of life ought not be rent asunder in order to achieve the good of preventing AIDS [citation needed]\n\n\nSocial programmes\nThere was strong criticism of the pope for the controversy surrounding the alleged use of charitable social programmes as a means of converting people in the Third World to Catholicism [397] [398] The pope created an uproar in the Indian subcontinent when he suggested that a great harvest of faith would be witnessed on the subcontinent in the third Christian millennium [399]\n\n\nArgentine military regime\nJohn Paul II endorsed Cardinal Pio Laghi, who critics say supported the Dirty War in Argentina and was on friendly terms with the Argentine generals of the military dictatorship, playing regular tennis matches with the Navy's representative in the junta, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera [400] [401] [402] [403]\n\n\nIan Paisley\nIn 1988, when John Paul II was delivering a speech to the European Parliament, Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, shouted \"I denounce you as the Antichrist!\" [404] [405] He held up a red banner reading \"Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST\" Otto von Habsburg (the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary), a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Germany, snatched Paisley's banner, tore it up, and along with other MEPs helped eject him from the chamber [404] [406] [407] [408] [409] The pope continued with his address after Paisley had been ejected [406] [410] [411]\n\n\nMeđugorje apparitions\nA number of quotes about the apparitions of Međugorje, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been attributed to John Paul II [412] In 1998, when a certain German gathered various statements that were supposedly made by the pope and Cardinal Ratzinger, and then forwarded them to the Vatican in the form of a memorandum, Ratzinger responded in writing on 22 July 1998: \"The only thing I can say regarding statements on Međugorje ascribed to the Holy Father and myself is that they are  [frei erfunden] complete invention\" [413] Similar claims were also rebuked by the Vatican's Secretariate of State [414]\n\n\nBeatification controversy\nSome Catholic theologians disagreed with the call for the beatification of John Paul II Eleven dissident theologians, including Jesuit professor José María Castillo and Italian theologian Giovanni Franzoni, said that his stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the church scandals during his pontificate presented \"facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification\" [415] Some traditionalist Catholics opposed his beatification and canonisation for his views on liturgy and participation in prayer with enemies of the church, heretics and non-Christians [416]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWojtyła was a Cracovia football team supporter, and the club retired number 1 in his honour [418] Having played the game himself as a goalkeeper, John Paul II was a fan of English football team Liverpool F.C., where his compatriot Jerzy Dudek played in the same position [419]\n\n\nSee

II\n\nIntroduction\nJohn Paul II was born Karol Józef Wojtyła on 18 May 1920, in the Polish town of Wadowice. He was the youngest of three children born to Karol Wojtyła, an ethnic Pole, and Emilia Kaczorowska, who was of distant Lithuanian heritage. Emilia, a schoolteacher, died from a heart attack and kidney failure in 1929 when Wojtyła was eight years old. His elder sister Olga had died before his birth, but he was close to his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior. Edmund's work as a physician eventually led to his death from scarlet fever, a loss that affected Wojtyła deeply.\n\nEarly life\nAfter finishing his studies at the seminary in Kraków, Wojtyła was ordained as a priest on All Saints' Day, 1 November 1946, by the Archbishop of Kraków, Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha. Sapieha sent Wojtyła to Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, to study under the French Dominican friar Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange beginning on 26 November 1946. Wojtyła earned a licence in July 1947, passed his doctoral exam on 14 June 1948, and successfully defended his doctoral thesis titled Doctrina de fide apud S Ioannem a Cruce (The Doctrine of Faith in St John of the Cross) in philosophy on 19 June 1948. The Angelicum preserves the original copy of Wojtyła's typewritten thesis. Among other courses at the Angelicum, Wojtyła studied Hebrew with the Dutch Dominican Peter G Duncker, author of the Compendium grammaticae linguae hebraicae biblicae.\n\nEpiscopate and cardinalate\nOn 4 July 1958, while Wojtyła was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, Pope Pius XII appointed him as an auxiliary bishop of Kraków. Wojtyła accepted the appointment as auxiliary bishop to Kraków's Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak, and he received episcopal consecration (as titular bishop of Ombi) on 28 September 1958, with Baziak as the principal consecrator and as co-consecrators Bishop Bolesław Kominek (titular bishop of Sophene), auxiliary of the Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław, and Franciszek Jop, Auxiliary Bishop of Sandomierz (Titular Bishop of Daulia). Kominek was to become Cardinal Archbishop of Wrocław and Jop was later Auxiliary Bishop of Wrocław and then Bishop of Opole. At the age of 38, Wojtyła became the youngest bishop in Poland.\n\nParticipation in Vatican II\nFrom October 1962, Wojtyła took part in the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), where he made contributions to two of its most historic and influential products, the Decree on Religious Freedom (in Latin, Dignitatis humanae) and the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes). Wojtyła and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Council for Gaudium et spes. According to the Jesuit historian John W O'Malley, the draft text Gaudium et spes that Wojtyła and the Polish delegation sent \"had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text.\" According to John F Crosby, as pope, John Paul II used the words of Gaudium et spes later to introduce his own views on the nature of the human person in relation to God: man is \"the only creature on earth that God has wanted for its own sake\", but man \"can fully discover his true self only in a sincere giving of himself.\"\n\nPastoral journeys\nDuring his pontificate, John Paul II made journeys to 129 countries, travelling more than 1,100,000 kilometres (680,000 mi) while doing so. He consistently attracted large crowds, some among the largest ever assembled in human history, such as the Manila World Youth Day 1995, which gathered up to four million people, the largest papal gathering ever, according to the Vatican. John Paul II's earliest official visits were to the Dominican Republic and Mexico in January 1979. While some of his journeys (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were to places previously visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico and Ireland. He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in Britain, he also visited Canterbury Cathedral and knelt in prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the spot where Thomas Becket was killed, as well as holding several large-scale open-air masses, including one at Wembley Stadium, which was attended by some 80,000 people.\n\nWorld Youth Days\nAs an extension of his successful work with youth as a young priest, John Paul II pioneered the international World Youth Days. John Paul II presided over nine of them: Rome (1985 and 2000), Buenos Aires (1987), Santiago de Compostela (1989), Częstochowa (1991), Denver (1993), Manila (1995), Paris (1997), and Toronto (2002).

The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been Pope Pius XI (1922–1939), who was an avid mountaineer.\n\nSexual abuse scandals\nJohn Paul II was criticised by representatives of the victims of clergy sexual abuse for failing to respond quickly enough to the Catholic sex abuse crisis.

elements of his strategy to \"reposition the Catholic Church\" were encyclicals such as Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Reconciliatio et paenitentia and Redemptoris Mater In his At the beginning of the new millennium (Novo Millennio Ineunte), he emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" In The Splendour of the Truth (Veritatis Splendor), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law (\"Without the Creator, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth\" He warned that man \"giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself\" In Fides et Ratio (On the Relationship between Faith and Reason) John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason, and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: Laborem exercens, Sollicitudo rei socialis, and Centesimus annus Through his encyclicals and many Apostolic Letters and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the dignity and the equality of women [123] He argued for the importance of the family for the future of humanity [76]\n\n\nSocial and political stances\nJohn Paul II was considered a conservative on doctrine and issues relating to human sexual reproduction and the ordination of women [124] While he was visiting the United States in 1977, the year before becoming pope, Wojtyła said: \"All human

while demonstratively avoiding South Africa During his visit to Zimbabwe, John Paul II called for economic sanctions against South Africa's government [132] After John Paul II's death, both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised the pope for defending human rights and condemning economic injustice [133]\n\n\nCapital punishment\nJohn Paul II was an outspoken opponent of the death penalty, which was a break from previous popes regarding the practise At a papal mass in St Louis, Missouri, in the United States he said:\n\n\nEnvironment and ecology\nJohn Paul II taught on the

conversion\", which was used in a general audience in The Vatican in 2001, [138] has been widely adopted, for example in the Mandate for Catholic Earthcare Australia, [139] and in the writings of Pope Francis [140]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nJohn Paul II pushed for a reference to Europe's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the European Constitution In his 2003 apostolic exhortation Ecclesia in Europa, John Paul II wrote that he \"fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions\" However, he wanted the constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a \"structured dialogue\" between each religious community and the European Union (EU), and extend across the EU the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states John Paul II said: \"I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe.\" The pope's desire for a reference to Europe's Christian identity in the EU Constitution was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the Church of England and Eastern Orthodox Churches from Russia, Romania, and Greece [141] John Paul II's demand to include a reference to Europe's Christian roots in the European Constitution was supported by some non-Christians, such as Joseph Weiler, a practising Orthodox Jew and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the EU Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a \"demonstration of neutrality\" but rather \"a Jacobin attitude\" [142]\n\n\nEvolution\nOn 22 October 1996, in a speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences plenary session at the Vatican, John Paul II said of evolution that \"this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favour of this theory.\" John Paul II's embrace of evolution was enthusiastically praised by American palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, [145] with whom he had an audience in 1984 [146]\n\n\nIraq War\nIn

War\nBetween 1990 and 1991, a 34-nation coalition led by the United States waged a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait John Paul II was a staunch opponent of the Gulf War Throughout the conflict, he appealed to the international community to stop the war, and after it was over led diplomatic initiatives to negotiate peace in the Middle East [162] In his 1991 encyclical Centesimus annus, John Paul II harshly condemned the conflict:\n\n\nRwandan genocide\nIn 1990, during the civil war between Tutsis and Hutus in the mostly Catholic country of Rwanda, John Paul II called for a ceasefire and condemned the persecution of the Tutsis [165] In 1994, he was the first world leader to condemn the massacre of the Tutsis as a genocide In 1995, during his third visit to Kenya before an audience of 300,000, John Paul II pleaded for an end to the violence in Rwanda and Burundi, urging forgiveness and reconciliation as a solution to the genocide He told Rwandan and Burundian refugees that he \"was close to them and shared their immense pain\" He said:\n\n\nViews on sexuality\nWhile taking a traditional position on human sexuality, maintaining the Catholic Church's moral opposition to homosexual acts, John Paul II asserted that people with homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as others [167] In his book Memory and Identity, he referred to the \"strong pressures\" by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: \"It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family.\" [76] [168]\n\n\nReform of canon law\nJohn Paul II completed a full-scale reform of the Catholic Church's legal system, Latin and Eastern, and a reform of the Roman Curia.\n\n\n1983 Code of Canon Law\nOn 25 January 1983, with the apostolic constitution Sacrae disciplinae leges John Paul II promulgated the current code of canon law for all members of the Catholic Church who belonged to the Latin Church It entered into force the first Sunday of the following Advent, [172] which was 27 November 1983 [173] John Paul II described the new code as \"the last document of Vatican II\" [172] Edward N Peters has referred to the 1983 Code as the \"Johanno-Pauline Code\" [174] (Johannes Paulus is Latin for \"John Paul\"), parallelling the \"Pio-Benedictine\" 1917 code that it replaced.\n\n\nCode of Canons of the Eastern Churches\nJohn Paul II promulgated the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO) on 18 October 1990, by the document Sacri Canones [175] The CCEO came into force of law on 1 October 1991 [176] It is the codification of the common portions of the canon law for the 23 of the 24 sui iuris churches in the Catholic Church that are the Eastern Catholic Churches It is divided into 30 titles and has a total of 1540 canons [177]\n\n\nPastor bonus\nJohn Paul II promulgated the apostolic constitution Pastor bonus on 28 June 1988 It instituted a number of reforms in the process of running the Roman Curia Pastor bonus laid out in considerable detail the organisation of the Roman Curia, specifying precisely the names and composition of each dicastery, and enumerating the competencies of each dicastery It replaced the previous special law, Regimini Ecclesiæ universæ, which was promulgated by Paul VI in 1967 [178]\n\n\nCatechism of the Catholic Church\nOn 11 October 1992, in his apostolic constitution Fidei depositum (The Deposit of Faith), John Paul ordered the publication of the Catechism of the Catholic Church [179] [180]\n\n\nSouth American and Caribbean dictatorships\nAccording to Joaquín Navarro-Valls, John Paul II's press secretary:\n\n\nChile\nBefore John Paul II's pilgrimage to Latin America, during a meeting with reporters, he criticised Augusto Pinochet's regime as \"dictatorial\" In the words of The New York Times, he used \"unusually strong language\" to criticise Pinochet and asserted to journalists that the Catholic Church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile [182]\n\n\nHaiti\nJohn Paul II visited Haiti on 9 March 1983, when the country was ruled by Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier He bluntly criticised the poverty of the country, directly addressing Baby Doc and his wife, Michèle Bennett in front of a large crowd of Haitians:\n\n\nParaguay\nThe collapse of the dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay was linked, among other things, to John Paul II's visit to the South American country in May 1988 [192] Since Stroessner's taking power through a coup d'état in 1954, Paraguay's bishops increasingly criticised the regime for human rights abuses, rigged elections, and the country's feudal economy During his private meeting with Stroessner, John Paul II told the dictator:\n\n\nRole in the fall of Communism\nBy the late 1970s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union had been predicted by some observers [194] [195] John Paul II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, [76] [90] [94] [111] [112] [196] by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for \"a peaceful revolution\" in Poland Lech Wałęsa, the founder of Solidarity and the first post-Communist President of Poland, credited John Paul II with giving Poles the courage to demand change [76] According to Wałęsa, \"Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs Nobody knew how to get rid of Communism In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land .. this land'.\" [196] It has also been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank covertly funded Solidarity [197] [198]\n\n\nRole as spiritual inspiration and catalyst\nBy the late 1970s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union had been predicted by some observers [194] [195] John Paul II has been credited with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, [76] [90] [94] [111] [112] [196] by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for \"a peaceful revolution\" in Poland Lech Wałęsa, the founder of Solidarity and the first post-Communist President of Poland, credited John Paul II with giving Poles the courage to demand change [76] According to Wałęsa, \"Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs Nobody knew how to get rid of Communism In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land .. this land'.\" [196] It has also been widely alleged that the Vatican Bank covertly funded Solidarity [197] [198]\n\n\nCommunist attempt to compromise John Paul II\nIn 1983, Poland's Communist government unsuccessfully tried to humiliate John Paul II by falsely saying he had fathered an illegitimate child Section D of Służba Bezpieczeństwa (SB), the security service, had an action named \"Triangolo\" to carry out criminal operations against the Catholic Church in Poland; the operation encompassed all Polish hostile actions against the pope [205] [better source needed] Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski, one of the murderers of beatified Jerzy Popiełuszko, was the leader of section D They drugged Irena Kinaszewska, the secretary of the Kraków-based weekly Catholic magazine Tygodnik Powszechny where Wojtyła had worked, and unsuccessfully attempted to make her admit to having had sexual relations with him [206]\n\n\nRelations with other Christian denominations\nJohn Paul II travelled extensively and met with believers from many divergent faiths At the World Day of Prayer for Peace, held in Assisi on 27 October 1986, more than 120 representatives of different religions and denominations spent a day of fasting and prayer [207]\n\n\nChurches of the East\nAlthough the contact between the Holy See and many Christians of the East had never totally ceased, communion had been interrupted since ancient times Again, the history of conflict in Central Europe was a complex part of John Paul II's personal cultural heritage which made him all the more determined to react so as to attempt to overcome abiding difficulties, given that relatively speaking the Holy See and the non-Catholic Eastern Churches are close in many points of faith.\n\n\nEastern Orthodox Church\nIn May 1999, John Paul II visited Romania on the invitation from Patriarch Teoctist Arăpaşu of the Romanian Orthodox Church This was the first time a pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the Great Schism in 1054 [208] On his arrival, the Patriarch and the President of Romania, Emil Constantinescu, greeted the pope [208] The Patriarch stated, \"The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity.\" [208]\n\n\nArmenian Apostolic Church\nJohn Paul II was determined to maintain good relations with the Armenian Apostolic Church, whose separation from the Holy See dated to Christian antiquity In 1996, he brought the Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church closer by agreeing with Armenian Archbishop Karekin II on Christ's nature [213] During an audience in 2000, John Paul II and Karekin II, by then the Catholicos of All Armenians, issued a joint statement condemning the Armenian genocide Meanwhile, the pope gave Karekin the relics of St Gregory the Illuminator, the first head of the Armenian Church that had been kept in Naples, Italy, for 500 years [214] In September 2001, John Paul II went on a three-day pilgrimage to Armenia to take part in an ecumenical celebration with Karekin II in the newly consecrated Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan The two Church leaders signed a declaration remembering the victims of the Armenian genocide [215]\n\n\nProtestantism\nLike his successors after him, John Paul II took a large number of initiatives to promote friendly relations, practical humanitarian cooperation and theological dialogue with a range of Protestant bodies Of these the first in importance had to be with Lutheranism, given that the contention with Martin Luther and his followers was the most significant historical split in Western Christianity [citation needed]\n\n\nLutheranism\nFrom 15 to 19 November 1980, John Paul II visited West Germany [216] on his first trip to a country with a large Lutheran Protestant population In Mainz, he met with leaders of the Protestant Church in Germany, and with representatives of other Christian denominations [citation needed]\n\n\nAnglicanism\nJohn Paul II had good relations with the Church of England, as also with other parts of the Anglican Communion He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen Elizabeth II, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England He preached in Canterbury Cathedral and received Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury He said that he was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to ordain women and saw it as a step away from unity between the Anglican Communion and the Catholic Church [219]\n\n\nRelations with Judaism\nRelations between Catholicism and Judaism improved dramatically during the pontificate of John Paul II [76] [106] He spoke frequently about the Catholic Church's relationship with the Jewish faith [76] It is likely that his attitude was shaped in part by his own experience of the terrible fate of the Jews in Poland and the rest of Central Europe in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\nRelations with other world religions\nIn his book-length interview Crossing the Threshold of Hope with the Italian journalist Vittorio Messori published in 1995, John Paul II draws parallels between animism and Christianity He wrote:\n\n\nAnimism\nIn his book-length interview Crossing the Threshold of Hope with the Italian journalist Vittorio Messori published in 1995, John Paul II draws parallels between animism and Christianity He wrote:\n\n\nBuddhism\nTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, visited John Paul II eight times The two men held many similar views and understood similar plights, both coming from nations affected by Communism and both serving as heads of major religious bodies [235] [236] As Archbishop of Kraków, long before the 14th Dalai Lama was a world-famous figure, Wojtyła held special Masses to pray for the Tibetan people's non-violent struggle for freedom from Maoist China [237] In 1987, he welcomed participants of the East-West Spiritual Exchanges, an initiative by the Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (DIMMID) and the Institute for Zen Studies in which Buddhist and Christian monks or nuns take turns residing for one month in each other's monasteries [238] [239] During his 1995 visit to Sri Lanka, a country where a majority of the population adheres to Theravada Buddhism, John Paul II expressed his admiration for Buddhism He said:\n\n\nIslam\nJohn Paul II made considerable efforts to improve relations between Catholicism and Islam [241]\n\n\nJainism\nIn 1995, John Paul II held a meeting with 21 Jains, organised by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue He praised Mohandas Gandhi for his \"unshakeable faith in God\", assured the Jains that the Catholic Church will continue to engage in dialogue with their religion and spoke of the common need to aid the poor The Jain leaders were impressed with the pope's \"transparency and simplicity\", and the meeting received much attention in the Gujarat state in western India, home to many Jains [249]\n\n\nAssassination attempts and plots\nAs he entered St Peter's Square to address an audience on 13 May 1981, [250] John Paul II was shot and critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca, [20] [94] [251] an expert Turkish gunman who was a member of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves [252] The assassin used a Browning 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, [253] shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times [90] John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness Even though the two bullets missed his superior mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds [254] Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal [254] When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation [255] One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends, philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery [81] The pope later stated that the Blessed Virgin Mary helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal [94] [251] [256] He said:\n\n\nApologies\nJohn Paul II apologised to many groups that had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church through the years [76] [269] Before becoming pope he had been a prominent editor and supporter of initiatives such as the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops from 1965 As pope, he officially made public apologies for over 100 wrongdoings, including: [270] [271] [272] [273]\n\n\nHealth\nWhen he became pope in 1978 at the age of 58, John Paul II was an avid sportsman He was extremely healthy and active, jogging in the Vatican gardens, weight training, swimming, and hiking in the mountains He was fond of football The media contrasted the new pope's athleticism and trim figure to the poor health of John Paul I and Paul VI, the portliness of John XXIII and the constant claims of ailments of Pius XII The only modern pope with a fitness regimen had been Pope Pius XI (1922–1939), who was an avid mountaineer [277] [278] An Irish Independent article in the 1980s labelled John Paul II the keep-fit pope.\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nJohn Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout of influenza on 1 February 2005 [280] He left the hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently hospitalised again with breathing problems two weeks later and underwent a tracheotomy [281]\n\n\nFinal months\nJohn Paul II was hospitalised with breathing problems caused by a bout of influenza on 1 February 2005 [280] He left the hospital on 10 February, but was subsequently hospitalised again with breathing problems two weeks later and underwent a tracheotomy [281]\n\n\nFinal illness and death\nOn 31 March 2005, following a urinary tract infection, [282] he developed septic shock, a form of infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised Instead, he was monitored by a team of consultants at his private residence This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican [282] Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, visited him at his bedside [79] [283] During the final days of the pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: \"I have searched for you, and now you have come to me, and I thank you.\" [284]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe death of the pontiff set in motion rituals and traditions dating back to medieval times The Rite of Visitation took place from 4 April 2005 to 7 April 2005 at St Peter's Basilica John Paul II's testament, published on 7 April 2005, [291] revealed that he contemplated being buried in his native Poland but left the final decision to the College of Cardinals, which in passing, preferred burial beneath St Peter's Basilica, honouring the pontiff's request to be placed \"in bare earth\".\n\n\nPosthumous recognition\nUpon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen [90] [274] [297] began referring to the late pontiff as \"John Paul the Great\" — in theory only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed [90] [297] [298] [299] Cardinal Angelo Sodano specifically referred to John Paul as \"the Great\" in his published written homily for the pope's funeral Mass of Repose [300] [301] The South African Catholic newspaper The Southern Cross has referred to him in print as \"John Paul II the Great\" [302] Some Catholic educational institutions in the US have additionally changed their names to incorporate \"the Great\", including John Paul the Great Catholic University and schools called some variant of John Paul the Great High School.\n\n\nTitle \"the Great\"\nUpon the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen [90] [274] [297] began referring to the late pontiff as \"John Paul the Great\" — in theory only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed [90] [297] [298] [299] Cardinal Angelo Sodano specifically referred to John Paul as \"the Great\" in his published written homily for the pope's funeral Mass of Repose [300] [301] The South African Catholic newspaper

including John Paul the Great Catholic University and schools called some variant of John Paul the Great High School.\n\n\nInstitutions named after John Paul II\nInspired by calls of \"Santo Subito!\" (\" [Make him a] Saint Immediately!\") from the crowds gathered during the funeral Mass that he celebrated, [314] [315] [316] [317] Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, bypassing the normal restriction that five years must pass after a person's death before beginning the beatification process [315] [316] [318] [319] In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome, who was responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who died within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\", which suggested that the waiting period could be waived [21] [274] [320] This decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St Peter's Square [321]\n\n\nBeatification\nInspired by calls of \"Santo Subito!\" (\" [Make him a] Saint Immediately!\") from the crowds gathered during the funeral Mass that he celebrated, [314] [315] [316] [317] Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, bypassing the normal restriction that five years must pass after a person's death before beginning the beatification process [315] [316] [318] [319] In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome, who was responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who died within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\", which suggested that the waiting period could be waived [21] [274] [320] This decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St Peter's Square [321]\n\n\nCanonisation\nTo be eligible for canonisation (being declared a saint) by the Catholic Church, two miracles must be attributed to a candidate.\n\n\nBeatification of the Pope's parents\nOn 10 October 2019, the Archdiocese of Kraków and the Polish Episcopal Conference approved nihil obstat the opening of the beatification cause of the parents of its patron saint John Paul II, Karol Wojtyła Sr and Emilia Kaczorowska It gained approval from the Holy See to open the diocesan phase of the cause on 7 May 2020 [356]\n\n\nSexual abuse scandals\nJohn Paul II was criticised by representatives of the victims of clergy sexual abuse for failing to respond quickly enough to the Catholic sex abuse crisis [357] After decades of inaction, the scandal came to a head when Sinéad O'Connor infamously tore up a photo of John Paul II on a 3 October 1992 episode of Saturday Night Live while performing an a capella rendition of Bob Marley's \"War\" [358]\n\n\nOther criticism and controversy\nJohn Paul II was widely criticised for a variety of his views He was a target of criticism from progressives for his opposition to the ordination of women and use of contraception, [20] [381] and from traditional Catholics for his support for the Second Vatican Council and its reform of the liturgy John Paul II's response to child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church has also come under heavy censure.\n\n\nOpus Dei controversies\nJohn Paul II was criticised for his support of the Opus Dei prelature and the 2002 canonisation of its founder, Josemaría Escrivá, whom he called \"the saint of ordinary life\" [382] [383] Other movements and religious organisations of the church went decidedly under his wing Legion of Christ, the Neocatechumenal Way, Schoenstatt, the charismatic movement, etc And he was accused repeatedly of taking a soft hand with them, especially in the case of Marcial Maciel, founder of the Legionaries of Christ [384]\n\n\nBanco Ambrosiano scandal\nJohn Paul II was alleged to have links with Banco Ambrosiano, an Italian bank that collapsed in 1982 [197] At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, Roberto Calvi, and his membership in the illegal Masonic Lodge Propaganda Due (aka P2) The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of John Paul I in 1978 is rumoured to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal [198]\n\n\nProblems with traditionalists\nIn addition to all the criticism from those demanding modernisation, some traditionalist Catholics denounced him as well These issues included demanding a return to the Tridentine Mass, [389] as well as the repudiation of reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin-language Roman Rite, ecumenism, and the principle of religious liberty [390] In 1988, the controversial traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of Saint Pius X (1970), was excommunicated under John Paul II because of the unapproved ordination of four bishops, which Cardinal Ratzinger called a \"schismatic act\" [391]\n\n\nReligion and AIDS\nJohn Paul II continued the tradition of advocating for the culture of life In solidarity with Pope Paul VI's Humanae vitae, he rejected artificial birth control, even in the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS [381] Critics have said that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate Third World poverty and problems, such as street children in South America John Paul II argued that the proper way to prevent the spread of AIDS was not condoms but rather \"correct practice of sexuality, which presupposes chastity and fidelity\" [381] The focus of John Paul II's point is that the need for artificial birth control is itself artificial, and that principle of respecting the sacredness of life ought not be rent asunder in order to achieve the good of preventing AIDS [citation needed]\n\n\nSocial programmes\nThere was strong criticism of the pope for the controversy surrounding the alleged use of charitable social programmes as a means of converting people in the Third World to Catholicism [397] [398] The pope created an uproar in the Indian subcontinent when he suggested that a great harvest of faith would be witnessed on the subcontinent in the third Christian millennium [399]\n\n\nArgentine military regime\nJohn Paul II endorsed Cardinal Pio Laghi, who critics say supported the Dirty War in Argentina and was on friendly terms with the Argentine generals of the military dictatorship, playing regular tennis matches with the Navy's representative in the junta, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera [400] [401] [402] [403]\n\n\nIan Paisley\nIn 1988, when John Paul II was delivering a speech to the European Parliament, Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, shouted \"I denounce you as the Antichrist!\" [404] [405] He held up a red banner reading \"Pope John Paul II ANTICHRIST\" Otto von Habsburg (the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary), a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Germany, snatched Paisley's banner, tore it up, and along with other MEPs helped eject him from the chamber [404] [406] [407] [408] [409] The pope continued with his address after Paisley had been ejected [406] [410] [411]\n\n\nMeđugorje apparitions\nA number of quotes about the apparitions of Međugorje, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been attributed to John Paul II [412] In 1998, when a certain German gathered various statements that were supposedly made by the pope and Cardinal Ratzinger, and then forwarded them to the Vatican in the form of a memorandum, Ratzinger responded in writing on 22 July 1998: \"The only thing I can say regarding statements on Međugorje ascribed to the Holy Father and myself is that they are  [frei erfunden] complete invention\" [413] Similar claims were also rebuked by the Vatican's Secretariate of State [414]\n\n\nBeatification controversy\nSome Catholic theologians disagreed with the call for the beatification of John Paul II Eleven dissident theologians, including Jesuit professor José María Castillo and Italian theologian Giovanni Franzoni, said that his stance against contraception and the ordination of women as well as the church scandals during his pontificate presented \"facts which according to their consciences and convictions should be an obstacle to beatification\" [415] Some traditionalist Catholics opposed his beatification and canonisation for his views on liturgy and participation in prayer with enemies of the church, heretics and non-Christians [416]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWojtyła was a Cracovia football team supporter, and the club retired number 1 in his honour [418] Having played the game himself as a goalkeeper, John Paul II was a fan of English football team Liverpool F.C., where his compatriot Jerzy Dudek played in the same position [419]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Five_Nights_at_Freddy's", "content": "\nHistory and development\nThe concept for Five Nights at Freddy's stemmed from the negative reception of Scott Cawthon's earlier game, Chipper & Sons Lumber Co., where players said that the main character resembled a \"scary animatronic animal.\" [1] [2] Initially discouraged by the criticism, Cawthon, who had predominantly created Christian-oriented games, leveraged this feedback to develop something intentionally frightening [2] [3] Five Nights at Freddy's was released on August 8, 2014, via Desura, [4] followed by a Steam release after gaining approval through the crowdsourcing platform Greenlight [5] The game rapidly gained popularity after being showcased by prominent YouTubers [1] [6]: 82 \n\n\nGameplay\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's series consists of psychological horror-themed video games in which the player is usually a night-time employee at a location connected with Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional children's restaurant that takes inspiration from family pizza chains like Chuck E Cheese and ShowBiz Pizza Place [3] [19] The restaurant has life-size animatronic characters resembling anthropomorphic animals that perform on a show stage, usually for children's parties, but leave their posts and wander the restaurant at night; the guard's job is to watch over them and prevent them from attacking The animatronics' mobility is stated in the first game to be necessary for them to continue functioning properly in the morning, though subsequent games reveal they are actually possessed by ghosts.\n\n\nCommon elements\nIn the first, second, third, seventh, [a] eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, the player has a security-camera system, which observes the animatronic characters One location can be viewed at a time, and some areas are not visible on the cameras [38] Most camera feeds are dull, sometimes almost black and white in color, and full of video noise In the third game, the cameras stop working if their associated system fails [39] Cameras are used in the fifth game as a mechanic in the fake ending and custom night update, but not in the main game.\n\n\nSecurity cameras\nIn the first, second, third, seventh, [a] eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, the player has a security-camera system, which observes the animatronic characters One location can be viewed at a time, and some areas are not visible on the cameras [38] Most camera feeds are dull, sometimes almost black and white in color, and full of video noise In the third game, the cameras stop working if their associated system fails [39] Cameras are used in the fifth game as a mechanic in the fake ending and custom night update, but not in the main game.\n\n\nLights\nIn all games except for the third, lights are used to ward off animatronics or warn the player Lights in the first, second, fifth, and eighth [b] games are activated with buttons on the walls and illuminate the player's blind spots: the doorway or vent exit, respectively [38] The lights are similar in the fifth game, but are mounted on a control pad and illuminate the animatronics' rooms The fifth game also introduced a flash beacon, which is used to orient the player in the third and fifth nights' pitch-black rooms [40]\n\n\nDoors and vents\nIn the first, fourth, seventh, [a] eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, doors are a means of defense for the player, and can be closed when an animatronic is near Vents are featured in the second, third, sixth, and eighth [b] games, as a medium through which animatronics can get to the player Both doors and vents are again present in the fake ending and custom night update of the fifth game with the same function Vents are also present in the fifth and ninth [c] games as means for the player to travel through, rather than the animatronics.\n\n\nJump scares\nEvery game in the main series contains jump scares, which end a game in defeat as the animatronics are implied to attack the player off-screen [42] In most jump scares, an animatronic character suddenly appears in the player's view, followed by a loud screaming or roaring noise Some jump scares, including those by Golden Freddy (in the first and seventh [a] games), Nightmare, and Nightmarionette (in the fourth game), consist of a single screen with shrill, distorted audio; these jump scares usually crash (or restart) the game The player must use various tools to prevent being attacked via jump scares and advance through each game [27]\n\n\nMinigames\nIn the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, the player gains access to a series of (predominantly eight-bit) minigames randomly after death, or after completing a specific task [24] The minigames usually relate to a story or event relevant to the game, in a cryptic manner [43] The minigames in the second game portray homicides mentioned by another worker of the restaurant, and the reason of the animatronics gaining life [44] The minigames in the third game show the story behind Springtrap's creation Minigames in the fourth game tell the story of a character who dies in a tragic accident [43]\n\n\nStory overview\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's series mainly revolves around a chain of family restaurants under the ownership of Fazbear Entertainment, a company founded by Henry

Cawthon. The franchise began with the release of the first game in 2014 and has since expanded to include multiple sequels, spin-offs, and merchandise.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's is a survival horror video game series that has gained a massive following worldwide. The franchise is known for its unique gameplay mechanics, atmospheric setting, and terrifying animatronic characters. The series has also spawned numerous spin-offs, including novels, merchandise, and a film adaptation. In this article, we will delve into the history of the franchise, gameplay mechanics, and cultural impact of Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\n**History and Development**\n\nThe concept for Five Nights at Freddy's stemmed from the negative reception of Scott Cawthon's earlier game, Chipper & Sons Lumber Co. Cawthon's intention was to create a game that was intentionally frightening, which was a departure from his previous work. The first game was released on August 8, 2014, via Desura, and later on Steam after gaining approval through the crowdsourcing platform Greenlight. The game quickly gained popularity after being showcased by prominent YouTubers.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's series consists of psychological horror-themed video games in which the player is usually a night-time employee at a location connected with Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional children's restaurant that takes inspiration from family pizza chains like Chuck E Cheese and ShowBiz Pizza Place. The restaurant has life-size animatronic characters resembling anthropomorphic animals that perform on a show stage, usually for children's parties, but leave their posts and wander the restaurant at night; the guard's job is to watch over them and prevent them from attacking. The animatronics' mobility is stated in the first game to be necessary for them to continue functioning properly in the morning, though subsequent games reveal they are actually possessed by ghosts.\n\n**Common Elements**\n\nIn the first, second, third, seventh, eighth, and ninth games, the player has a security-camera system, which observes the animatronic characters. One location can be viewed at a time, and some areas are not visible on the cameras. Most camera feeds are dull, sometimes almost black and white in color, and full of video noise. In the third game, the cameras stop working if their associated system fails. Cameras are used in the fifth game as a mechanic in the fake ending and custom night update, but not in the main game.\n\n**Lights**\n\nIn all games except for the third, lights are used to ward off animatronics or warn the player. In the first, second, fifth, and eighth games, lights are activated with buttons on the walls and illuminate the player's blind spots: the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The lights are similar in the fifth game, but are mounted on a control pad and illuminate the animatronics' rooms. The fifth game also introduced a flash beacon, which is used to orient the player in the third and fifth nights' pitch-black rooms.\n\n**Doors and Vents**\n\nIn the first, fourth, seventh, eighth, and ninth games, doors are a means of defense for the player, and can be closed when an animatronic is near. Vents are featured in the second, third, sixth, and eighth games, as a medium through which animatronics can get to the player. Both doors and vents are again present in the fake ending and custom night update of the fifth game with the same function. Vents are also present in the fifth and ninth games as means for the player to travel through, rather than the animatronics.\n\n**Jump Scares**\n\nEvery game in the main series contains jump scares, which end a game in defeat as the animatronics are implied to attack the player off-screen. In most jump scares, an animatronic character suddenly appears in the player's view, followed by a loud screaming or roaring noise. Some jump scares, including those by Golden Freddy (in the first and seventh games), Nightmare, and Nightmarionette (in the fourth game), consist of a single screen with shrill, distorted audio; these jump scares usually crash (or restart) the game.\n\n**Minigames**\n\nIn the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and ninth games, the player gains access to a series of (predominantly eight-bit) minigames randomly after death, or after completing a specific task. The minigames usually relate to a story or event relevant to the game, in a cryptic manner. The minigames in the second game portray homicides mentioned by another worker of the restaurant, and the reason of the animatronics gaining life. The minigames in the third game show the story behind Springtrap's creation. Minigames in the fourth game tell the story of a character who dies in a tragic accident.\n\n**Story Overview**\n\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's series mainly revolves around a chain of family restaurants under the ownership of Fazbear Entertainment, a company founded by Henry Emily and William Afton. The latter is a robotics engineer who creates a series of animatronic mascots to entertain customers, including Freddy Fazbear, a brown bear and the namesake of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Bonnie, an indigo rabbit, Chica, a yellow chicken, and Foxy, a red pirate fox. Other notable animatronics include the Puppet, the ghostlike Golden Freddy, Freddy's predecessor Fredbear, and Circus Baby, the mascot of the restaurant's sister location, Circus Baby's Pizza World. William is also a negligent father and child murderer who hides his victims' bodies inside animatronics, which their souls inhabit; he specifically designs Circus Baby to be capable of murdering children, which leads to the accidental death of his own daughter, Elizabeth.\n\n**Games**\n\nThe main series consists of eight games: Five Nights at Freddy's, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, Five Nights at Freddy's 3, Five Nights at Freddy's 4, Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, Ultimate Custom Night, and Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach.\n\n**Spin-Offs**\n\nThe franchise has spawned numerous spin-offs, including novels, merchandise, and a film adaptation. The novels, written by Scott Cawthon and Kira Breed-Wrisley, are a trilogy that explores the history and events of the franchise. The first novel, The Silver Eyes, was published in 2015, followed by The Twisted Ones in 2017 and The Fourth Closet in 2018. The novels have received mixed reviews from critics and fans, with some praising the storytelling and others criticizing the quality of the writing.\n\n**Merchandise**\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's merchandise is primarily produced by two companies: Sanshee and Funko. The merchandise includes stuffed toys, action figures, posters, clothing, keychains, and stationery, among other things. McFarlane Toys also has a line of Five Nights at Freddy's merchandise, consisting mainly of construction sets. The merchandise has been a factor in the franchise's success, with fans worldwide purchasing the items to showcase their love for the franchise.\n\n**Fandom**\n\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's fandom is a large and dedicated community of fans who share their love for the franchise. Fans have created countless pieces of fan art, cosplay, and fiction based on the franchise, showcasing their creativity and passion.

article in English about \"Five_Nights_at_Freddy's\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory and development\nThe concept for Five Nights at Freddy's stemmed from the negative reception of Scott Cawthon's earlier game, Chipper & Sons Lumber Co., where players said that the main character resembled a \"scary animatronic animal.\" [1] [2] Initially discouraged by the criticism, Cawthon, who had predominantly created Christian-oriented games, leveraged this feedback to develop something intentionally frightening [2] [3] Five Nights at Freddy's was released on August 8, 2014, via Desura, [4] followed by a Steam release after gaining approval through the crowdsourcing platform Greenlight [5] The game rapidly gained popularity after being showcased by prominent YouTubers [1] [6]: 82 \n\n\nGameplay\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's series consists of psychological horror-themed video games in which the player is usually a night-time employee at a location connected with Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a fictional children's restaurant that takes inspiration from family pizza chains like Chuck E Cheese and ShowBiz Pizza Place [3] [19] The restaurant has life-size animatronic characters resembling anthropomorphic animals that perform on a show stage, usually for children's parties, but leave their posts and wander the restaurant at night; the guard's job is to watch over them and prevent them from attacking The animatronics' mobility is stated in the first game to be necessary for them to continue functioning properly in the morning, though subsequent games reveal they are actually possessed by ghosts.\n\n\nCommon elements\nIn the first, second, third, seventh, [a] eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, the player has a security-camera system, which observes the animatronic characters One location can be viewed at a time, and some areas are not visible on the cameras [38] Most camera feeds are dull, sometimes almost black and white in color, and full of video noise In the third game, the cameras stop working if their associated system fails [39] Cameras are used in the fifth game as a mechanic in the fake ending and custom night update, but not in the main game.\n\n\nSecurity cameras\nIn the first, second, third, seventh, [a] eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, the player has a security-camera system, which observes the animatronic characters One location can be viewed at a time, and some areas are not visible on the cameras [38] Most camera feeds are dull, sometimes almost black and white in color, and full of video noise In the third game, the cameras stop working if their associated system fails [39] Cameras are used in the fifth game as a mechanic in the fake ending and custom night update, but not in the main game.\n\n\nLights\nIn all games except for the third, lights are used to ward off animatronics or warn the player Lights in the first, second, fifth, and eighth [b] games are activated with buttons on the walls and illuminate the player's blind spots: the doorway or vent exit, respectively [38] The lights are similar in the fifth game, but are mounted on a control pad and illuminate the animatronics' rooms The fifth game also introduced a flash beacon, which is used to orient the player in the third and fifth nights' pitch-black rooms [40]\n\n\nDoors and vents\nIn the first, fourth, seventh, [a] eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, doors are a means of defense for the player, and can be closed when an animatronic is near Vents are featured in the second, third, sixth, and eighth [b] games, as a medium through which animatronics can get to the player Both doors and vents are again present in the fake ending and custom night update of the fifth game with the same function Vents are also present in the fifth and ninth [c] games as means for the player to travel through, rather than the animatronics.\n\n\nJump scares\nEvery game in the main series contains jump scares, which end a game in defeat as the animatronics are implied to attack the player off-screen [42] In most jump scares, an animatronic character suddenly appears in the player's view, followed by a loud screaming or roaring noise Some jump scares, including those by Golden Freddy (in the first and seventh [a] games), Nightmare, and Nightmarionette (in the fourth game), consist of a single screen with shrill, distorted audio; these jump scares usually crash (or restart) the game The player must use various tools to prevent being attacked via jump scares and advance through each game [27]\n\n\nMinigames\nIn the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, [b] and ninth [c] games, the player gains access to a series of (predominantly eight-bit) minigames randomly after death, or after completing a specific task [24] The minigames usually relate to a story or event relevant to the game, in a cryptic manner [43] The minigames in the second game portray homicides mentioned by another worker of the restaurant, and the reason of the animatronics gaining life [44] The minigames in the third game show the story behind Springtrap's creation Minigames in the fourth game tell the story of a character who dies in a tragic accident [43]\n\n\nStory overview\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's series mainly revolves around a chain of family restaurants under the ownership of Fazbear Entertainment, a company founded by Henry Emily and William Afton The latter is a robotics engineer who creates a series of animatronic mascots to entertain customers, including Freddy Fazbear, a brown bear and the namesake of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Bonnie, an indigo rabbit, Chica, a yellow chicken, and Foxy, a red pirate fox Other notable animatronics include the Puppet, the ghostlike Golden Freddy, Freddy's predecessor Fredbear, and Circus Baby, [44] the mascot of the restaurant's sister location, Circus Baby's Pizza World William is also a negligent father and child murderer who hides his victims' bodies inside animatronics, which their souls inhabit; he specifically designs Circus Baby to be capable of murdering children, which leads to the accidental death of his own daughter, Elizabeth [44]\n\n\nGames\nFive Nights at Freddy's was released for Microsoft Windows on August 8, 2014, followed by ports for Android and iOS on August 27 and September 11, respectively A Windows Phone version

Born in Los Angeles, California, Boyce began his career as a child actor and went on to appear in numerous projects throughout his life. His career spanned over a decade, during which he worked with several notable actors and directors. Tragically, Boyce passed away at the age of 20 due to a seizure related to an ongoing medical condition. In this article, we will delve into Boyce's early life, career, death, philanthropy, and legacy.\n\n**Early and Personal Life**\n\nCameron Boyce was born on May 28, 1999, in Los Angeles, California. His father, Victor Boyce, is an African-American actor, and his mother, Libby Boyce, is a Jewish actress. Boyce's paternal grandmother, Jo Ann Boyce (née Allen), was one of the Clinton Twelve, the first African-Americans to attend an integrated high school in the Southern United States, in 1956, as ordered by the landmark court case Brown v Board of Education. Boyce's paternal grandfather was from the Caribbean, and he has stated that he has a strong connection to his African-American and Jewish heritage.\n\n**Career**\n\nBoyce began his career as a child actor in 2008, when he appeared in the music video \"That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)\" as a younger version of Panic! at the Disco guitarist Ryan Ross. In July 2008, he appeared in General Hospital: Night Shift as a recurring character named Michael. That same year, Boyce made his feature film debut with a starring role in the horror film Mirrors, as well as appearing in the mystery-thriller film Eagle Eye. Boyce's early success paved the way for future projects, including television shows and films.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn July 6, 2019, Boyce was found unresponsive at his home in Los Angeles, California. Authorities were called, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. According to a statement made by Boyce's family, Boyce died in his sleep due to a seizure which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated. An autopsy was performed, but the release of a cause of death was deferred pending further investigation. On July 9, 2019, Boyce's family confirmed that his death was caused by an epileptic seizure and that Boyce was previously diagnosed with epilepsy. The autopsy results were released by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner on July 30, 2019, confirming Boyce's cause of death was due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.\n\n**Philanthropy and Legacy**\n\nIn the span of 40 days in 2017, Boyce helped raise over $27,000 for the Thirst Project, which helps bring clean water to underdeveloped countries. In September 2019, Thirst Project officially changed the name of the Pioneering Spirit Award to the Cameron Boyce Pioneering Spirit Award, to honor his work with the organization. Boyce's dedication to philanthropy and his commitment to making a positive impact on the world are a testament to his character.\n\n**The Cameron Boyce Foundation**\n\nFollowing Boyce's death in 2019, The Cameron Boyce Foundation, a nonprofit organization, was founded in Los Angeles through Network for Good. The foundation provides young people artistic and creative outlets as alternatives to violence and negativity and uses resources and philanthropy for positive change in the world. The foundation aims to continue Boyce's legacy by supporting young people and promoting positive change in the world.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Film**\n\n* Mirrors (2008)\n* Eagle Eye (2008)\n* Grown Ups 2 (2013)\n* Jessie (2015)\n* Runt (2015)\n* Jessie (2016)\n* Party of Five (2018)\n* Code Black (2018)\n* Slaughterhouse Rulez (2018)\n\n**Television**\n\n* General Hospital: Night Shift (2008)\n* Jessie (2011-2015)\n* Grown Ups 2 (2013)\n* Jessie (2014)\n* Jessie (2015)\n* Code Black (2018)\n* Party of Five (2018)\n\n**Video Games and Web Series**\n\n* Kirby Star Allies (2018)\n* Jessie (2011-2015)\n* Jessie (2014-2015)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* 2011: Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) for his role in Jessie\n* 2012: Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) for his role in Jessie\n* 2013: Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) for his role in Jessie\n* 2014: Young Artist Award nomination for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) for his role in Jessie\n\nThe article about Cameron Boyce has been completed.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cameron_Boyce\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly and personal life\nBoyce was born in Los Angeles, California, on May 28, 1999 [2] [3] Boyce was born to an African-American father, Victor Boyce and a Jewish mother, Libby Boyce [4] [5] [6] [7] [excessive citations] His paternal grandmother, Jo Ann Boyce (née Allen), was one of the Clinton Twelve, the first African-Americans to attend an integrated high school in the Southern United States, in 1956, as ordered by Brown v Board of Education [8] His paternal grandfather was from the Caribbean [6]\n\n\nCareer\nIn May 2008, Boyce made his debut as a child actor in the music video \"That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)\", appearing as a younger version of Panic! at the Disco guitarist Ryan Ross In July 2008, he appeared in General Hospital: Night Shift as a recurring character named Michael [12] In August 2008, he made his feature film debut with a starring role in the horror film Mirrors, as well as appearing in the mystery-thriller film Eagle Eye that fall [13] [14]\n\n\nDeath\nOn July 6, 2019, Boyce, aged 20, was found unresponsive at his home in Los Angeles, California Authorities were called, and he was pronounced dead at the scene [30] According to a statement made by Boyce's family, Boyce died in his sleep \"due to a seizure which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated\" [2] [31] An autopsy was performed, but release of a cause of death was deferred pending further investigation [32] On July 9, 2019, Boyce's family confirmed that his death was caused by an epileptic seizure and that Boyce was previously diagnosed with epilepsy [33] The autopsy results were released by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner on July 30, 2019, confirming Boyce's cause of death was due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy [34] His body was cremated, and his ashes were returned to his family [35]\n\n\nPhilanthropy and legacy\nIn the span of 40 days in 2017, Boyce helped raise over $27,000 for the Thirst Project, which helps bring clean water to underdeveloped countries [36] In September 2019, Thirst Project officially changed the name of the Pioneering Spirit Award to the Cameron Boyce Pioneering Spirit Award, to honor his work with the organization [37]\n\n\nThe Cameron Boyce Foundation\nFollowing Boyce's death in 2019, The Cameron Boyce Foundation, a nonprofit organization, was founded in Los Angeles through Network for Good that provides young people artistic and creative outlets as alternatives to violence and negativity and uses resources and philanthropy for positive change in the world [43]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games and web series\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Internet", "content": "\nTerminology\nThe word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven [13] The word Internet was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, [14] and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork [15] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks [16]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 1960s, computer scientists began developing systems for time-sharing of computer resources [22] [23] J C R Licklider proposed the idea of a universal network while working at Bolt Beranek & Newman and, later, leading the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran at RAND in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies at the United Kingdom's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1965 [2] [24] After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network and routing concepts proposed by Baran were incorporated into the design of the ARPANET, an experimental resource sharing network proposed by ARPA [25] [26] [27]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe Internet is a global network that comprises many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks It operates without a central governing body The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet [63]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc However, as an example of internetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily Internet equipment per se  The internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n\nService tiers\nInternet service providers (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed fiber-optic cables and governed by peering agreements Tier 2 and lower-level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's national research and education network, JANET.\n\n\nAccess\nCommon methods of Internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, satellite, and cellular telephone technology (e.g 3G, 4G) The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and Internet cafés Internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops Various terms are used, such as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web payphone Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi cafés, where users need to bring their own wireless devices, such as a laptop or PDA These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.\n\n\nMobile communication\n The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimated that, by the end of 2017, 48% of individual users regularly connect to the Internet, up from 34% in 2012 [71] Mobile Internet connectivity has played an important role in expanding access in recent years, especially in Asia and the Pacific and in Africa [72] The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.9 billion in 2012 to 4.8 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world's population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific The number of subscriptions was predicted to rise to 5.7 billion users in 2020 [73] As of 2018 [update], 80% of the world's population were covered by a 4G network [73] The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet Fragmentation restricts access to media content and tends to affect the poorest users the most [72]\n\n\nInternet Protocol Suite\nThe Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite (also called TCP/IP, based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four conceptional layers by the scope of their operation, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123 At the top is the application layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application For example, a web browser operates in a client–server application model and exchanges information with the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an application-germane data structure, such as the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).\n\n\nInternet protocol\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP) IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n\nIP Addresses\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides IP addresses IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via DHCP, or are configured.\n\n\nIPv4\nInternet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number [77] IPv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use It was designed in 1981 to address up to ≈4.3 billion (109) hosts However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, [78] when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.\n\n\nIPv6\nBecause of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998 [79] [80] [81] IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s and is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion [82]\n\n\nSubnetwork\nA subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network [83]: 1, 16  The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.\n\n\nRouting\nComputers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct IP packets to reach a node on a different subnetwork Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet The default gateway is the node that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet [84] [85]\n\n\nIETF\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [86] The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture The resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n\nApplications and services\nThe Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, electronic mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony, file sharing, and streaming media services Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in data centers, and content is often accessed through high-performance content delivery networks.\n\n\nWorld Wide Web\nThe World Wide Web is a global collection of documents, images, multimedia, applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which provide a global system of named references URIs symbolically identify services, web servers, databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web Web services also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistics and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet [87]\n\n\nCommunication\nEmail is an important communications service available via the Internet The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet [89] [90] Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as email attachments Email messages can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses.\n\n\nData transfer\nFile sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"mirror\" servers or peer-to-peer networks In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n\nSocial impact\nThe Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet The early Internet left an impact on some writers who used symbolism to write about it, such as describing the Internet as a \"means to connect individuals in a vast invisible net over all the earth.\" [95]\n\n\nUsers\nBetween 2000 and 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 390 million to 1.9 billion [99] By 2010, 22% of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube [100] In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 44 percent of world population, but two-thirds came from the richest countries, with 78 percent of Europeans using the Internet, followed by 57 percent of the Americas [101] However, by 2018, Asia alone accounted for 51% of all Internet users, with 2.2 billion out of the 4.3 billion Internet users in the world China's Internet users surpassed a major milestone in 2018, when the country's Internet regulatory authority, China Internet Network Information Centre, announced that China had 802 million users [102] China was followed by India, with some 700 million users, with the United States third with 275 million users However, in terms of penetration, in 2022 China had a 70% penetration rate compared to India's 60% and the United States's 90% [103] In 2022, 54% of the world's Internet users were based in Asia, 14% in Europe, 7% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 11% in Africa, 4% in the Middle East and 1% in Oceania [104] In 2019, Kuwait, Qatar, the Falkland Islands, Bermuda and Iceland had the highest Internet penetration by the number of users, with 93% or more of the population with access [105] As of 2022, it was estimated that 5.4 billion people use the Internet, more than two-thirds of the world's population [106]\n\n\nUsage\nThe Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile Internet devices Mobile phones, datacards, handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the Internet wirelessly Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\n\nSocial networking and entertainment\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests People use chat, messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals Social networking services such as Facebook have created new ways to socialize and interact Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, pursue common interests, and connect with others It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people Sites like LinkedIn foster commercial and business connections YouTube and Flickr specialize in users' videos and photographs Social networking services are also widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"go viral\" \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as spam accounts and astroturfing.\n\n\nElectronic business\nElectronic business (e-business) encompasses business processes spanning the entire value chain: purchasing, supply chain management, marketing, sales, customer service, and business relationship E-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners According to International Data Corporation, the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013 A report by Oxford Economics added those two together to estimate the total size of the digital economy at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales [135]\n\n\nRemote work\nRemote work is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, videotelephony, and VoIP so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost More workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks.\n\n\nCollaborative publishing\nWikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries [141] In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work [142] The United States Patent and Trademark Office uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications Queens, New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park [143] The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web [144] and ranks in the top 10 among all sites in terms of traffic [145]\n\n\nPolitics and political revolutions\nThe Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to Internet activism [146] [147] The New York Times suggested that social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information [148]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nThe spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations that post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice and receive their money back as borrowers repay Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves [153] [154]\n\n\nSecurity\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information [155]\n\n\nMalware\nMalware is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet It includes computer viruses which are copied with the help of humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks, ransomware, botnets, and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users Usually, these activities constitute cybercrime Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of hackers using cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale [156]\n\n\nSurveillance\nThe vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet [166] In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies [167] [168] [169] Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called \"packets\", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete \"message\" again Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool That is it gathers \"messages\" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and VoIP traffic [170]\n\n\nCensorship\nSome governments, such as those of Burma, Iran, North Korea, Mainland China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters [178]\n\n\nPerformance\nAs the Internet is a heterogeneous network, its physical characteristics, including, for example the data transfer rates of connections, vary widely It exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization [180]\n\n\nTraffic volume\nThe volume of Internet traffic is difficult to measure because no single point of measurement exists in the multi-tiered, non-hierarchical topology Traffic data may be estimated from the aggregate volume through the peering points of the Tier 1 network providers, but traffic that stays local in large provider networks may not be accounted for.\n\n\nOutages\nAn Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions Disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to the small number of high-capacity links Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia [181] Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of Internet censorship, as in the blockage of the Internet in Egypt, whereby approximately 93% [182] of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests [183]\n\n\nEnergy use\nEstimates of the Internet's electricity usage have been the subject of controversy, according to a 2014 peer-reviewed research paper that found claims differing by a factor of 20,000 published in the literature during the preceding decade, ranging from 0.0064 kilowatt hours per gigabyte transferred (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB [184] The researchers attributed these discrepancies mainly to the year of reference (i.e whether efficiency gains over time had been taken into account) and to whether \"end devices such as personal computers and servers are included\" in the analysis [184]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high-speed fiber-optic cables.\n\nAccess\n\nCommon methods of Internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, satellite, and cellular telephone technology. The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and Internet cafés. Public terminals are widely available in many public places, such as airport halls and coffee shops.\n\nMobile Communication\n\nMobile Internet connectivity has played an important role in expanding access in recent years, especially in Asia and the Pacific and in Africa. The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions has increased from 3.9 billion in 2012 to 4.8 billion in 2016.\n\nInternet Protocol Suite\n\nThe Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite. This framework consists of a set of four conceptual layers, which are ordered by the scope of their operation. The top layer is the application layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application.\n\nIP Addresses\n\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides IP addresses. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet.\n\nIPv4 and IPv6\n\nThe Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. IPv4 was designed in 1981 to address up to approximately 4.3 billion hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion. A new version of IP, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic.\n\nSubnetwork\n\nA subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses.\n\nRouting\n\nComputers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct IP packets to reach a node on a different subnetwork. Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols. End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet.\n\nIETF\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a non-profit organization that brings together international participants to develop and maintain the Internet's core protocols. The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. The resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site.\n\nApplications and Services\n\nThe Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, electronic mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony, file sharing, and streaming media services. Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in data centers, and content is often accessed through high-performance content delivery networks.\n\nWorld Wide Web\n\nThe World Wide Web is a global collection of documents, images, multimedia, applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, web servers, databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide.\n\nCommunication\n\nEmail is an important communications service available via the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as email attachments.\n\nData Transfer\n\nFile sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues, and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues.\n\nSocial Impact\n\nThe Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations. This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet. The early Internet left an impact on some writers who used symbolism to write about it, such as describing the Internet as a \"means to connect individuals in a vast invisible net over all the earth.\"\n\nUsers\n\nBetween 2000 and 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 390 million to 1.9 billion. By 2010, 22% of the world's population had access to computers, with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube. In 2014, the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion, or 44% of world population.\n\nUsage\n\nThe Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile Internet devices. Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather, and sports reports, to plan and book vacations, and to pursue their personal interests.\n\nElectronic Business\n\nElectronic business (e-business) encompasses business processes spanning the entire value chain: purchasing, supply chain management, marketing, sales, customer service, and business relationship. E-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners.\n\nRemote Work\n\nRemote work is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, videotelephony, and VoIP so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost.\n\nCollaborative Publishing\n\nWikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries. In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work.\n\nPolitics and Political Revolutions\n\nThe Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to Internet activism.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nThe spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.\n\nSecurity\n\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail, or access private information. Malware is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet.\n\nSurveillance\n\nThe vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet. In the United States, for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nCensorship\n\nSome governments, such as those of Burma, Iran, North Korea, Mainland China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters.\n\nPerformance\n\nAs the Internet is a heterogeneous network, its physical characteristics, including, for example, the data transfer rates of connections, vary widely. It exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization.\n\nTraffic Volume\n\nThe volume of Internet traffic is difficult to measure because no single point of measurement exists in the multi-tiered, non-hierarchical topology. Traffic data may be estimated from the aggregate volume through the peering points of the Tier 1 network providers, but traffic that stays local in large provider networks may not be accounted for.\n\nOutages\n\nAn Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption. Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to the small number of high-capacity links.\n\nEnergy Use\n\nEstimates of the Internet's electricity usage have been the subject of controversy, according to a 2014 peer-reviewed research paper that found claims differing by a factor of 20,000 published in the literature during the preceding decade, ranging from 0.0064 kilowatt hours per gigabyte transferred (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB. The researchers attributed these discrepancies mainly to the year of reference (i.e., whether efficiency gains over time had been taken into account) and to whether \"end devices such as personal computers and servers are included\" in the analysis.\n\nSee Also\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Internet.

Security\n* Internet Censorship\n* Internet Performance\n* Internet Traffic\n* Internet Outages\n* Internet Energy Use", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Internet\" following this outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nThe word internetted was used as early as 1849, meaning interconnected or interwoven [13] The word Internet was used in 1945 by the United States War Department in a radio operator's manual, [14] and in 1974 as the shorthand form of Internetwork [15] Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks [16]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 1960s, computer scientists began developing systems for time-sharing of computer resources [22] [23] J C R Licklider proposed the idea of a universal network while working at Bolt Beranek & Newman and, later, leading the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran at RAND in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies at the United Kingdom's National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1965 [2] [24] After the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967, packet switching from the proposed NPL network and routing concepts proposed by Baran were incorporated into the design of the ARPANET, an experimental resource sharing network proposed by ARPA [25] [26] [27]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe Internet is a global network that comprises many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks It operates without a central governing body The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet [63]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc However, as an example of internetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily Internet equipment per se  The internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n\nService tiers\nInternet service providers (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed fiber-optic cables and governed by peering agreements Tier 2 and lower-level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as GEANT, GLORIAD, Internet2, and the UK's national research and education network, JANET.\n\n\nAccess\nCommon methods of Internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires, Wi-Fi, satellite, and cellular telephone technology (e.g 3G, 4G) The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and Internet cafés Internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops Various terms are used, such as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web payphone Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi cafés, where users need to bring their own wireless devices, such as a laptop or PDA These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based.\n\n\nMobile communication\n The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimated that, by the end of 2017, 48% of individual users regularly connect to the Internet, up from 34% in 2012 [71] Mobile Internet connectivity has played an important role in expanding access in recent years, especially in Asia and the Pacific and in Africa [72] The number of unique mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 3.9 billion in 2012 to 4.8 billion in 2016, two-thirds of the world's population, with more than half of subscriptions located in Asia and the Pacific The number of subscriptions was predicted to rise to 5.7 billion users in 2020 [73] As of 2018 [update], 80% of the world's population were covered by a 4G network [73] The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet Fragmentation restricts access to media content and tends to affect the poorest users the most [72]\n\n\nInternet Protocol Suite\nThe Internet standards describe a framework known as the Internet protocol suite (also called TCP/IP, based on the first two components.) This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four conceptional layers by the scope of their operation, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123 At the top is the application layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application For example, a web browser operates in a client–server application model and exchanges information with the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an application-germane data structure, such as the HyperText Markup Language (HTML).\n\n\nInternet protocol\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP) IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n\nIP Addresses\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides IP addresses IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via DHCP, or are configured.\n\n\nIPv4\nInternet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number [77] IPv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use It was designed in 1981 to address up to ≈4.3 billion (109) hosts However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, [78] when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted.\n\n\nIPv6\nBecause of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998 [79] [80] [81] IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s and is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion [82]\n\n\nSubnetwork\nA subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network [83]: 1, 16  The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.\n\n\nRouting\nComputers and routers use routing tables in their operating system to direct IP packets to reach a node on a different subnetwork Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet The default gateway is the node that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet [84] [85]\n\n\nIETF\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [86] The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture The resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n\nApplications and services\nThe Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, electronic mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony, file sharing, and streaming media services Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in data centers, and content is often accessed through high-performance content delivery networks.\n\n\nWorld Wide Web\nThe World Wide Web is a global collection of documents, images, multimedia, applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which provide a global system of named references URIs symbolically identify services, web servers, databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web Web services also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistics and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet [87]\n\n\nCommunication\nEmail is an important communications service available via the Internet The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet [89] [90] Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as email attachments Email messages can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses.\n\n\nData transfer\nFile sharing is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"mirror\" servers or peer-to-peer networks In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n\nSocial impact\nThe Internet has enabled new forms of social interaction, activities, and social associations This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet The early Internet left an impact on some writers who used symbolism to write about it, such as describing the Internet as a \"means to connect individuals in a vast invisible net over all the earth.\" [95]\n\n\nUsers\nBetween 2000 and 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 390 million to 1.9 billion [99] By 2010, 22% of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube [100] In 2014 the world's Internet users surpassed 3 billion or 44 percent of world population, but two-thirds came from the richest countries, with 78 percent of Europeans using the Internet, followed by 57 percent of the Americas [101] However, by 2018, Asia alone accounted for 51% of all Internet users, with 2.2 billion out of the 4.3 billion Internet users in the world China's Internet users surpassed a major milestone in 2018, when the country's Internet regulatory authority, China Internet Network Information Centre, announced that China had 802 million users [102] China was followed by India, with some 700 million users, with the United States third with 275 million users However, in terms of penetration, in 2022 China had a 70% penetration rate compared to India's 60% and the United States's 90% [103] In 2022, 54% of the world's Internet users were based in Asia, 14% in Europe, 7% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 11% in Africa, 4% in the Middle East and 1% in Oceania [104] In 2019, Kuwait, Qatar, the Falkland Islands, Bermuda and Iceland had the highest Internet penetration by the number of users, with 93% or more of the population with access [105] As of 2022, it was estimated that 5.4 billion people use the Internet, more than two-thirds of the world's population [106]\n\n\nUsage\nThe Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile Internet devices Mobile phones, datacards, handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the Internet wirelessly Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\n\nSocial networking and entertainment\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests People use chat, messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals Social networking services such as Facebook have created new ways to socialize and interact Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, pursue common interests, and connect with others It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people Sites like LinkedIn foster commercial and business connections YouTube and Flickr specialize in users' videos and photographs Social networking services are also widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"go viral\" \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as spam accounts and astroturfing.\n\n\nElectronic business\nElectronic business (e-business) encompasses business processes spanning the entire value chain: purchasing, supply chain management, marketing, sales, customer service, and business relationship E-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners According to International Data Corporation, the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013 A report by Oxford Economics added those two together to estimate the total size of the digital economy at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales [135]\n\n\nRemote work\nRemote work is facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, conference calling, videotelephony, and VoIP so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost More workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks.\n\n\nCollaborative publishing\nWikis have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries [141] In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work [142] The United States Patent and Trademark Office uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications Queens, New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park [143] The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web [144] and ranks in the top 10 among all sites in terms of traffic [145]\n\n\nPolitics and political revolutions\nThe Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to Internet activism [146] [147] The New York Times suggested that social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt, by helping activists organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information [148]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nThe spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations that post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice and receive their money back as borrowers repay Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves [153] [154]\n\n\nSecurity\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information [155]\n\n\nMalware\nMalware is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet It includes computer viruses which are copied with the help of humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks, ransomware, botnets, and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users Usually, these activities constitute cybercrime Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of hackers using cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale [156]\n\n\nSurveillance\nThe vast majority of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet [166] In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies [167] [168] [169] Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called \"packets\", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete \"message\" again Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool That is it gathers \"messages\" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and VoIP traffic [170]\n\n\nCensorship\nSome governments, such as those of Burma, Iran, North Korea, Mainland China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, restrict access to content on the Internet within their territories, especially to political and religious content, with domain name and keyword filters [178]\n\n\nPerformance\nAs the Internet is a heterogeneous network, its physical characteristics, including, for example the data transfer rates of connections, vary widely It exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization [180]\n\n\nTraffic volume\nThe volume of Internet traffic is difficult to measure because no single point of measurement exists in the multi-tiered, non-hierarchical topology Traffic data may be estimated from the aggregate volume through the peering points of the Tier 1 network providers, but traffic that stays local in large provider networks may not be accounted for.\n\n\nOutages\nAn Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions Disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to the small number of high-capacity links Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia [181] Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of Internet censorship, as in the blockage of the Internet in Egypt, whereby approximately 93% [182] of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests [183]\n\n\nEnergy use\nEstimates of the Internet's electricity usage have been the subject of controversy, according to a 2014 peer-reviewed research paper that found claims differing by a factor of 20,000 published in the literature during the preceding decade, ranging from 0.0064 kilowatt hours per gigabyte transferred (kWh/GB) to 136 kWh/GB [184] The researchers attributed these discrepancies mainly to the year of reference (i.e whether efficiency gains over time had been taken into account) and to whether \"end devices such as personal computers and servers are included\" in the analysis [184]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Gab_(social_network)", "content": "\nHistory\nGab was founded in 2016 by chief executive officer (CEO) Andrew Torba and chief technology officer (CTO) Ekrem Büyükkaya, who had previously worked together at advertising technology company Automate Ads (formerly Kuhcoon) [1] [3] Torba started working on the site in May 2016 and on August 15, 2016, Gab launched in private beta, billing itself as a \"free speech\" alternative to social networking sites Twitter and Facebook [37] [38] [11] Torba has cited \"the entirely left-leaning Big Social monopoly\", \"social justice bullying\", \"the rise of online censorship during the 2016 election.\" and an alleged bias against conservative articles by Facebook as his reasons for creating Gab [39] [37] [40] [17] Gab AI, Inc was incorporated on September 9, 2016 [41] Utsav Sanduja later joined Gab as chief operating officer (COO) [14]\n\n\n2016–2018\nGab originally did not use advertising, describing itself as an \"ad-free social network\" [158] The site began offering a subscription service for Gab named \"GabPro\" in mid March 2017 [11] In November 2017, Gab launched a new tier of subscriptions called \"GabPro Premium\", which was targeted at content creators who wished to charge a subscription fee for their content and collect tips [260]\n\n\n2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting\nRobert Gregory Bowers, the suspected shooter in the attack against a Pittsburgh synagogue on October 27, 2018, maintained an active, verified Gab account where he displayed the neo-Nazi code-phrase \"1488\" and a bio that said, \"jews are the children of satan\" Just prior to the shooting, he used this account to post \"HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered Screw your optics, I'm going in\" [62] [63]\n\n\n2019\nGab turned to cryptocurrency payment processing services after being rejected from PayPal and Stripe in the aftermath of the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting In January 2019, Coinbase and Square, Inc.'s Cash App closed the accounts held by Gab and Andrew Torba [81] On January 22, 2019, Gab announced that it had partnered with Second Amendment Processing (SAP), a Michigan-based payment processor [82] Gab removed SAP's credit card payment functionalities in March 2019, only accepting payment via cryptocurrency or check The same month, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published an investigation that found that SAP's founder had been convicted of financial crimes in 2007 Gab has not said why it removed the payment processor [83]\n\n\n2020\nIn early 2020, Gab launched Gab Chat in beta, an encrypted text messaging service described by Mashable as an alternative to Discord [31] In late June 2020, hackers leaked a May 26 law enforcement bulletin that was distributed by Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), a whistleblower site that publishes leaked documents The bulletin was created by the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange Fusion Center, who speculated that Gab Chat's encryption and privacy features for private chatting, such as the service automatically deleting text messages after 30 days of them being sent, could entice white supremacists to use the platform instead of Discord, a platform on which white supremacist groups have been frequently infiltrated by anti-fascists [31] When reached for a comment by Mashable, Torba responded to the bulletin in an email saying \"Encryption does not render law enforcement totally blind\" and that \"Encryption doesn't cause a user to simply disappear It doesn't prevent a service provider from seeing who is using its service or when that person is using the service\" [31] Torba also deflected from the concern of white supremacists using Gab Chat, saying that law enforcement should instead focus on stopping child exploitation on mainstream text messaging services [31]\n\n\n2021\nAlthough early claims were made that Gab was among the platforms used to plan the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, [25] a later investigation by the FBI said it \"found scant evidence that the January 6 attack on the U.S Capitol was the result of an organized plot to overturn the presidential election result\", and that \"ninety to ninety-five percent of these are one-off cases\" [103]  [dubious – discuss]\n\n\nStorming of the United States Capitol\nAlthough early claims were made that Gab was among the platforms used to plan the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, [25] a later investigation by the FBI said it \"found scant evidence that the January 6 attack on the U.S Capitol was the result of an organized plot to overturn the presidential election result\", and that \"ninety to ninety-five percent of these are one-off cases\" [103]  [dubious – discuss]\n\n\nSubsequent events\nOn January 19, Rachel E Greenspan from Business Insider observed that Gab had tweeted a direct quote from a post by Q, the anonymous individual or group whose messages form the basis of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory The tweet was later deleted [115] She also noted that Gab's Twitter account had posted multiple tweets referencing Jesus, including one tweet posted on January 18 featuring an image of Jesus walking with Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character used by the alt-right [115]\n\n\nHacks and data leaks\nOn the evening of February 19, Gab's website briefly went offline, originally without explanation [123] [124] In response, several Twitter users posted images showing Gab accounts run by right-wing media outlets, such as The Gateway Pundit and National File, asking people to donate funds to a suspicious URL [125] After the site was restored, Torba responded in a blog post saying that Gab themselves had taken the site offline at around 6:25 pm EST, sixteen minutes after they \"became aware of several accounts that were posting bitcoin wallet spam and related content\" [124] [126] According to Torba, fewer than 20 accounts were affected, Gab \"have no indication that any sensitive account information was breached or accessed by any unauthorized users\", and that \"Because of our quick action zero bitcoin was sent\" [124] [126] Torba did not specify which accounts were affected [126] Torba also said that Gab had \"identified and patched a security vulnerability in our codebase\" and that \"Our engineering team is conducting a full audit of our logs and infrastructure\" [124]\n\n\n2022\nOn January 24, 2022, Torba announced that Gab would sponsor the America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) run by white nationalist commentator Nick Fuentes Torba also criticized the Conservative Political Action Conference and Turning Point USA, saying that \"CPAC is sponsored by Facebook and Google among other billionaires\" and \"TPUSA is sponsored by atheist libertarian billionaires.\" Torba has also entered into a partnership with Fuentes' livestreaming service Torba received backlash from Gab users over the sponsorship, with many pointing out that Fuentes had recently made harsh comments about Gab users, including one comment calling users \"fucking retarded\" and another comment stating: \"Average IQ on Gab is like 50\" Many of Gab's donors said that they would stop funding Gab In response to the backlash, Torba said that \"Controversy is attention Attention is influence\" and that \"The point of marketing is to influence people to get off Big Tech and get on Gab In order to do that I need their attention.\" [141] It was later announced that Torba would be a guest speaker at the AFPAC [142] Torba also created an account on Fuentes' livestreaming service [142]\n\n\nDoug Mastriano's payment to Gab\nIn July 2022, Eric Hananoki of Media Matters for America revealed that Doug Mastriano, Republican nominee for the 2022 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, paid Gab $5,000 for \"campaign consulting.\" on April 28, 2022 As a result of the payments, every new account on Gab automatically followed Mastriano's account [147] [148] Torba claimed that the money did not go towards consulting, but was instead used to pay for advertisements on Gab [17] Torba also endorsed Mastriano's campaign for Governor of Pennsylvania, calling him \"a strong Christian man to lead PA out of the pit of hell and into the glory of God.\" [17] Torba defended his views on Christian nationalism, saying that \"We must be grounded in Biblical Truth and led by people who call Christ their King\" [17] The Republican Jewish Coalition denounced the payment, citing Gab as a hotspot for antisemitism and white supremacy [149] [150] The head of the coalition, Matt Brooks, asked Mastriano to delete his Gab account and terminate all associations with the platform [151] Mastriano's connection to Gab was additionally condemned by Pennsylvania state representative Dan Frankel (who is Jewish), Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (who is also Jewish), by Democrats, and by Democratic Jewish organizations [17] [152] [153] In August 2022, Mastriano released a statement denouncing antisemitism and distanced himself from Torba, saying that he \"doesn't speak for me or my campaign\" [154] Mastriano also deleted his Gab account [17]\n\n\nUsers and content\nDefunct\n\n\nUsers\nThe site has attracted far-right or alt-right users who have been banned or suspended from other services Since its foundation in 2016, high-profile participants have included former Breitbart News writer and polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos; [155] citizen journalist Tim Pool; [156] conservative commentator Dave Rubin; [156] former British National Party leader Nick Griffin; [77] Australian neo-Nazis Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson and Australian MP George Christensen; [157] [158] Republican Party representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Paul Gosar; [159] [160] former Republican Party of Texas chairman Allen West; [156] former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon; [161] Dutch politician and Leader of the Party for Freedom Geert Wilders; [162] and white supremacists Richard B Spencer, [8] [39] Tila Tequila, [42] Vox Day, [163] and Christopher Cantwell [164] Far-right political parties and party candidates, including Britain First, [165] Spanish Vox, [166] and UKIP candidates such as Mark Meechan [27] and Carl Benjamin, [167] have also been participants Following the Christchurch mosque shootings and a reduced tolerance on other social media for hate speech, several members of United Patriots Front, an Australian far-right extremist organization, urged their supporters to follow them on Gab after being banned from Twitter and Facebook [168] Disclose.tv, a German disinformation outlet with a following that includes Holocaust deniers and neo-Nazis, maintains an account on Gab [169] [5]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn early February 2021, multiple media outlets falsely reported that former-President Trump had joined Gab under the handle @realdonaldtrump [183] [184] The Independent speculated \"that confusion arose from the presence of a blue check mark indicating the account was verified\" and Vice News speculated that the bio of the account, which read \"45th President of the United States of America Uncensored posts from the @realDonaldTrump Feed\", had also caused confusion [185]\nThe Gab post that was mistaken to be from Trump was actually from Torba and featured a copy of a genuine letter sent by Trump's lawyers to Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, who had called on Trump to testify at his second impeachment hearing [183] [185] Thousands of users on Gab were also led to believe after the post was made that Trump had joined the platform under the handle [184] [186] Torba responded to the false reports in a blog post, saying that \"@realdonaldtrump is and always has been a mirror archive of POTUS' tweets and statements that we've run for years We've always been transparent about this and would obviously let people know if the President starts using it\" [123] He also criticized the media outlets that falsely reported that Trump had joined the platform [183] Also in response to the false reports, the @realdonaldtrump Gab account made a post that was pinned saying that the account is reserved for Trump and urged users of Gab to send messages to Trump asking him to join the platform [186]\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine avoidance and disinformation\nIn late July 2021, Torba claimed in a Gab post that he was \"getting flooded\" with text messages from members of the U.S military who claimed that they would be court-martialed if they refused a COVID-19 vaccine [190] The post amassed 10,000 likes and shares [190] Torba also posted documents on Gab's news site that contain misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine and claimed in an email in response to The New York Times that \"I'm telling the truth\" and \"Your Facebook-funded 'fact checkers' like Graphika are wrong and are the people peddling disinformation here\" [190] Torba also posted a conversation he had with the Times reporter, saying \"I am sharing this all with you now to let you know how these wicked people operate and to shine a light on their lies, deception, and anti-Christian attacks They aren't just attacking me, they are attacking any and all dissent and opposition to their libido dominandi (lust for power)\" [75]\n\n\nUserbase estimates\nIn November 2021, when asked by The Washington Post about Gab's Brazilian user base, Torba responded in an email on November 8, saying \"Ya my comment is 'God bless Jair Bolsonaro and Jesus Christ is King.' No further comment.\" [193]\n\n\nAntisemitic content\nRita Katz, a researcher and analyst of terrorism and extremism, wrote in Politico Magazine in October 2018 that Robert Bowers' extreme antisemitic postings were \"anything but an anomaly\" on the website, and, \" [they highlight] concerns about its growing facilitation of white nationalism and other far-right movements\" She found that Gab user profiles often contained Nazi symbolism, and Stormfront users had praised the site as a place to post antisemitic content Katz found that many Gab users were celebrating immediately after Bowers' massacre against the Tree of Life synagogue, and wrote that far-right communities' rise to popularity on Gab is \"remarkably similar\" to the rise of ISIS on social media [195] In November 2018, Twitter user Jason Baumgartner, who owns a website dedicated to detecting hate speech on social media, found that using the search term \"oven\" on Gab brought up the terms \"Jews\", \"Holocaust\", and \"Hitler\" the most among thousands of analyzed comments [196]\n\n\nBy Gab\nGab itself has engaged in antisemitic commentary [15] [21] Torba has repeatedly praised Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes [142]\n\n\nViolence and terrorism policy\nGab's official policy states that the company has a \"zero-tolerance policy towards threats of violence and use of our platform for criminal purposes\" [117] [208]\n\n\nModeration policy\nGab claims that its platform does not restrict content unless the content is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution [47] Restrictions on content on Gab include illegal activity, credible threats of violence, promotion of terrorism, obscenity, pornography, spamming, selling weapons or drugs, child exploitation, impersonation, and doxing [209] [210]\n\n\nHosting and termination of services by web services providers\nOn December 14, 2016, Apple Inc declined Gab's submission of its app to the Apple App Store, citing pornographic content as the reason Also on December 14, Twitter cut off Gab's access to the Twitter API after Gab introduced a feature to its social network that allowed users to share their Gab posts directly to Twitter [212] In response, Torba said in a December 15 Periscope livestream that \"This is targeted, and we believe that we're being singled out\" and that \"This is the nonsense from Silicon Valley This is the monopoly and level of control that they have\" [212] On January 21, 2017, a revised version of the app that blocked pornography by default was also rejected due to \"objectionable content\" including \"references to religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, or other targeted groups that could be offensive to many users\" [213] In response, Torba accused Apple of \"double standards and extreme scrutiny\" \"while allowing Big Social apps to display the same and arguably worse content in their own apps\" [213] Gab launched its Android app for the Google Play Store in May 2017 [11] Later that year, on August 17, Google removed Gab's app from the Play Store for violating its policy against hate speech, stating that the app did not \"demonstrate a sufficient level of moderation, including for content that encourages violence and advocates hate against groups of people\" [214] On September 14, 2017, Gab filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, but dropped the suit on October 22, 2017, in favor of lobbying Congress to take action against \"monopolized tech giants\" [215] [216] [217] In early October 2018, Gab's Stripe account was suspended due to adult content on Gab [218] On October 3, Gab tweeted in response: \"We've had this content and a NSFW setting for two years with no issues from them until now\" [218]\n\n\nReception\nGab has been described as \"Twitter for racists\" by progressive news outlet Salon, [227] a \"hate-filled echo chamber of racism and conspiracy theories\" by The Guardian, [228] an \"online cesspool of anti-Semitism\" by Politico Magazine, [195] a \"safe haven for banned Twitter trolls, Gamergaters, Pizzagaters and high-profile white nationalists\" by Mic, [229] \"the far-right's favorite social network\" by The Verge, [230] \"the Make America Great Again of social sites\" by The New York Times [39] and \"an almost anti-Twitter\" by NPR [25] Wired criticized Gab for not explicitly prohibiting hate speech [231] Scholars have described Gab as \"hateful\", and named Gab along with 4chan and 8chan as directly radicalizing men who went on to commit violent acts [18] The SPLC characterized Gab as a site where its users are \"radicalized aggressively\" Heidi Beirich, a director of the center, stated that the site is \"the number one place nowadays where white supremacists gather\" [232] The ADL called Gab a \"fringe online community\" and \"a bastion of hatred and bigotry\" [233]\n\n\nChinese government influence operations\nIn September 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Gab was targeted by a Chinese government influence operation called Spamouflage, which aimed to spread disinformation and state propaganda [252]\n\n\nCompany\nGab was founded by CEO Andrew Torba and CTO Ekrem Büyükkaya [1] and the company was incorporated on September 9, 2016 [41]\n\n\nRevenue\nGab earns revenue through premium subscriptions, donations, and affiliate partnerships [11] [259] Gab has been refused service by several payment processors including PayPal and Stripe, causing the site to at various times rely on payments by postal mail, cryptocurrency, and \"obscure\" payment processors to receive payment for its subscription service From 2017 to 2018, Gab raised $2 million from the sale of speculative securities through the crowdfunding platform StartEngine Gab sought approval from the SEC for a Regulation A exempt offering of $10 million in 2017, but it remained pending until March 2019 when Gab withdrew the request [84] In a 2020 SEC filing, Gab said that \"We may not be able to obtain adequate financing to continue our operations\" and that Gab has yet \"to earn a substantial profit or substantial operating revenue\", putting into question the company's \"business prospects\" [75]\n\n\n2016–2018\nGab originally did not use advertising, describing itself as an \"ad-free social network\" [158] The site began offering a subscription service for Gab named \"GabPro\" in mid March 2017 [11] In November 2017, Gab launched a new tier of subscriptions called \"GabPro Premium\", which was targeted at content creators who wished to charge a subscription fee for their content and collect tips [260]\n\n\n2019–present\nGab partnered with the \"obscure\" Second Amendment Processing for credit card payment processing in January 2019, but removed credit card payment options in March of the same year [82] [84] This removal came after an SPLC investigation published in early March 2019 found that Thomas Michael Troyer, founder of Second Amendment Processing, had been convicted of financial crimes in 2007 [83]\n\n\nDesign\nIn 2016, Gab's color theme was a minimalist combination of black text on white panels with pink hashtags and usernames Pro users had a contrasted top bar in dark blue The interface displayed messages in a Twitter-like vertical scroll timeline with an option to upvote or downvote each post The site also aggregated popular posts and trending topic hashtags [42] [231] As of 2017, users could sort comments and posts in a subject by time or score Default biographies for new users displayed a randomly chosen quotation about the importance of free speech [229] Users also had the option to \"mute\" other users and terms [2] As of July 2020 [update], Gab's user interface was similar to that of Twitter, having a dashboard in the middle of the page with trending content on the left and menus on the right [30] As of 2021, posts on Gab are limited to 5,000 characters [265] [266]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

high-profile participants have included former Breitbart News writer and polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos; [155] citizen journalist Tim Pool; [156] conservative commentator Dave Rubin; [156] former British National Party leader Nick Griffin; [77] Australian neo-Nazis Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson and Australian MP George Christensen; [157] [158] Republican Party representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, and Paul Gosar; [159] [160] former Republican Party of Texas chairman Allen West; [156] former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon; [161] Dutch politician and Leader of the Party for Freedom Geert Wilders; [162] and white supremacists Richard B Spencer, [8] [39] Tila Tequila, [42] Vox Day, [163] and Christopher Cantwell [164] Far-right political parties and party candidates, including Britain First, [165] Spanish Vox, [166] and UKIP candidates such as Mark Meechan [27] and Carl Benjamin, [167] have also been participants Following the Christchurch mosque shootings and a reduced tolerance on other social media for hate speech, several members of United Patriots Front, an Australian far-right extremist organization, urged their supporters to follow them on Gab after being banned from Twitter and Facebook [168] Disclose.tv, a German disinformation outlet with a following that includes Holocaust deniers and neo-Nazis, maintains an account on Gab [169] [5]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn early February 2021, multiple media outlets falsely reported that former-President Trump had joined Gab under the handle @realdonaldtrump [183] [184] The Independent speculated \"that confusion arose from the presence of a blue check mark indicating the account was verified\" and Vice News speculated that the bio of the account, which read \"45th President of the United States of America Uncensored posts from the @realDonaldTrump Feed\", had also caused confusion [185]\nThe Gab post that was mistaken to be from Trump was actually from Torba and featured a copy of a genuine letter sent by Trump's lawyers to Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, who had called on Trump to testify at his second impeachment hearing [183] [185] Thousands of users on Gab were also led to believe after the post was made that Trump had joined the platform under the handle [184] [186] Torba responded to the false reports in a blog post, saying that \"@realdonaldtrump is and always has been a mirror archive of POTUS' tweets and statements that we've run for years We've always been transparent about this and would obviously let people know if the President starts using it\" [123] He also criticized the media outlets that falsely reported that Trump had joined the platform [183] Also in response to the false reports, the @realdonaldtrump Gab account made a post that was pinned saying that the account is reserved for Trump and urged users of Gab to send messages to Trump asking him to join the platform [186]\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine avoidance and disinformation\nIn late July 2021, Torba claimed in a Gab post that he was \"getting flooded\" with text messages from members of the U.S military who claimed that they would be court-martialed if they refused a COVID-19 vaccine [190] The post amassed 10,000 likes and shares [190] Torba also posted documents on Gab's news site that contain misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine and claimed in an email in response to The New York Times that \"I'm telling the truth\" and \"Your Facebook-funded 'fact checkers' like Graphika are wrong and are the people peddling disinformation here\" [190] Torba also posted a conversation he had with the Times reporter, saying \"I am sharing this all with you now to let you know how these wicked people operate and to shine a light on their lies, deception, and anti-Christian attacks They aren't just attacking me, they are attacking any and all dissent and opposition to their libido dominandi (lust for power)\" [75]\n\n\nUserbase estimates\nIn November 2021, when asked by The Washington Post about Gab's Brazilian user base, Torba responded in an email on November 8, saying \"Ya my comment is 'God bless Jair Bolsonaro and Jesus Christ is King.' No further comment.\" [193]\n\n\nAntisemitic content\nRita Katz, a researcher and analyst of terrorism and extremism, wrote in Politico Magazine in October 2018 that Robert Bowers' extreme antisemitic postings were \"anything but an anomaly\" on the website, and, \" [they highlight] concerns about its growing facilitation of white nationalism and other far-right movements\" She found that Gab user profiles often contained Nazi symbolism, and Stormfront users had praised the site as a place to post antisemitic content Katz found that many Gab users were celebrating immediately after Bowers' massacre against the Tree of Life synagogue, and wrote that far-right communities' rise to popularity on Gab is \"remarkably similar\" to the rise of ISIS on social media [195] In November 2018, Twitter user Jason Baumgartner, who owns a website dedicated to detecting hate speech on social media, found that using the search term \"oven\" on Gab brought up the terms \"Jews\", \"Holocaust\", and \"Hitler\" the most among thousands of analyzed comments [196]\n\n\nBy Gab\nGab itself has engaged in antisemitic commentary [15] [21] Torba has repeatedly praised Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes [142]\n\n\nViolence and terrorism policy\nGab's official policy states that the company has a \"zero-tolerance policy towards threats of violence and use of our platform for criminal purposes\" [117] [208]\n\n\nModeration policy\nGab claims that its platform does not restrict content unless the content is not protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution [47] Restrictions on content on Gab include illegal activity, credible threats of violence, promotion of terrorism, obscenity, pornography, spamming, selling weapons or drugs, child exploitation, impersonation, and doxing [209] [210]\n\n\nHosting and termination of services by web services providers\nOn December 14, 2016, Apple Inc declined Gab's submission of its app to the Apple App Store, citing pornographic content as the reason Also on December 14, Twitter cut off Gab's access to the Twitter API after Gab introduced a feature to its social network that allowed users to share their Gab posts directly to Twitter [212] In response, Torba said in a December 15 Periscope livestream that \"This is targeted, and we believe that we're being singled out\" and that \"This is the nonsense from Silicon Valley This is the monopoly and level of control that they have\" [212] On January 21, 2017, a revised version of the app that blocked pornography by default was also rejected due to \"objectionable content\" including \"references to religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, or other targeted groups that could be offensive to many users\" [213] In response, Torba accused Apple of \"double standards and extreme scrutiny\" \"while allowing Big Social apps to display the same and arguably worse content in their own apps\" [213] Gab launched its Android app for the Google Play Store in May 2017 [11] Later that year, on August 17, Google removed Gab's app from the Play Store for violating its policy against hate speech, stating that the app did not \"demonstrate a sufficient level of moderation, including for content that encourages violence and advocates hate against groups of people\" [214] On September 14, 2017, Gab filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, but dropped the suit on October 22, 2017, in favor of lobbying Congress to take action against \"monopolized tech giants\" [215] [216] [217] In early October 2018, Gab's Stripe account was suspended due to adult content on Gab [218] On October 3, Gab tweeted in response: \"We've had this content and a NSFW setting for two years with no issues from them until now\" [218]\n\n\nReception\nGab has been described as \"Twitter for racists\" by progressive news outlet Salon, [227] a \"hate-filled echo chamber of racism and conspiracy theories\" by The Guardian, [228] an \"online cesspool of anti-Semitism\" by Politico Magazine, [195] a \"safe haven for banned Twitter trolls, Gamergaters, Pizzagaters and high-profile white nationalists\" by Mic, [229] \"the far-right's favorite social network\" by The Verge, [230] \"the Make America Great Again of social sites\" by The New York Times [39] and \"an almost anti-Twitter\" by NPR [25] Wired criticized Gab for not explicitly prohibiting hate speech [231] Scholars have described Gab as \"hateful\", and named Gab along with 4chan and 8chan as directly radicalizing men who went on to commit violent acts [18] The SPLC characterized Gab as a site where its users are \"radicalized aggressively\" Heidi Beirich, a director of the center, stated that the site is \"the number one place nowadays where white supremacists gather\" [232] The ADL called Gab a \"fringe online community\" and \"a bastion of hatred and bigotry\" [233]\n\n\nChinese government influence operations\nIn September 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Gab was targeted by a Chinese government influence operation called Spamouflage, which aimed to spread disinformation and state propaganda [252]\n\n\nCompany\nGab was founded by CEO Andrew Torba and CTO Ekrem Büyükkaya [1] and the company was incorporated on September 9, 2016 [41]\n\n\nRevenue\nGab earns revenue through premium subscriptions, donations, and affiliate partnerships [11] [259] Gab has been refused service by several payment processors including PayPal and Stripe, causing the site to at various times rely on payments by postal mail, cryptocurrency, and \"obscure\" payment processors to receive payment for its subscription service From 2017 to 2018, Gab raised $2 million from the sale of speculative securities through the crowdfunding platform StartEngine Gab sought approval from the SEC for a Regulation A exempt offering of $10 million in 2017, but it remained pending until March 2019 when Gab withdrew the request [84] In a 2020 SEC filing, Gab said that \"We may not be able to obtain adequate financing to continue our operations\" and that Gab has yet \"to earn a substantial profit or substantial operating revenue\", putting into question the company's \"business prospects\" [75]\n\n\n2016–2018\nGab originally did not use advertising, describing itself as an \"ad-free social network\" [158] The site began offering a subscription service for Gab named \"GabPro\" in mid March 2017 [11] In November 2017, Gab launched a new tier of subscriptions called \"GabPro Premium\", which was targeted at content creators who wished to charge a subscription fee for their content and collect tips [260]\n\n\n2019–present\nGab partnered with the \"obscure\" Second Amendment Processing for credit card payment processing in January 2019, but removed credit card payment options in March of the same year [82] [84] This removal came after an SPLC investigation published in early March 2019 found that Thomas Michael Troyer, founder of Second Amendment Processing, had been convicted of financial crimes in 2007 [83]\n\n\nDesign\nIn 2016, Gab's color theme was a minimalist combination of black text on white panels with pink hashtags and usernames Pro users had a contrasted top bar in dark blue The interface displayed messages in a Twitter-like vertical scroll timeline with an option to upvote or downvote each post The site also aggregated popular posts and trending topic hashtags [42] [231] As of 2017, users could sort comments and posts in a subject by time or score Default biographies for new users displayed a randomly chosen quotation about the importance of free speech [229] Users also had the option to \"mute\" other users and terms [2] As of July 2020 [update], Gab's user interface was similar to that of Twitter, having a dashboard in the middle of the page with trending content on the left and menus on the right [30] As of 2021, posts on Gab are limited to 5,000 characters [265] [266]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

only child of Mary, Princess Royal, and stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange Mary was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and sister of kings Charles II and James II and VII.\n\n\nBirth and family\nWilliam III was born in The Hague in the Dutch Republic on 4 November 1650 [c] [2] Baptised William Henry (Dutch: Willem Hendrik), he was the only child of Mary, Princess Royal, and stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange Mary was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and sister of kings Charles II and James II and VII.\n\n\nChildhood and education\nWilliam's mother showed little personal interest in her son, sometimes being absent for years, and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society [6] William's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard [7] and the Scottish noblewoman Lady Anna Mackenzie [8] From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the Contra-Remonstrant theologian Gisbertus Voetius [7]\n\n\nEarly offices\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant [f] At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder [24] After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for long, was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed [25] In 1660, William's mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused [25]\n\n\nExclusion from stadtholdership\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant [f] At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder [24] After the English Restoration, the Act of Seclusion, which had not remained a secret for long, was declared void as the English Commonwealth (with which the treaty had been concluded) no longer existed [25] In 1660, William's mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused [25]\n\n\nConflict with republicans\nIn November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange [33] Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders [33] Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state [33] In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses [34]\n\n\nBecoming stadtholder\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous It became known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Waterline on 8 June [40] Louis XIV of France, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible [41] The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies [41]\n\n\n\"Disaster year\" and Franco-Dutch War\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous It became known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne Although the Anglo-French fleet

possible [41] The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies [41]\n\n\nMarriage\nDuring the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies [61] James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree [62] Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately [63] Charles relented, and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677 [64] Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but miscarried After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again [65]\n\n\nTensions with France, intrigue with England\nBy 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic [67] Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"universal kingship\" over Europe; Louis described William as \"my mortal enemy\" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the Réunion policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic [68] This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the League of Augsburg (an anti-French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686 [69]\n\n\nGlorious Revolution\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain [76] Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade [77] In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy [78] Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church [79]\n\n\nInvasion of England\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now

publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church [79]\n\n\nProclaimed king\nWilliam summoned a Convention Parliament in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight [88] William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort [89] The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain [90] Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death [91] When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately Furthermore, she, remaining loyal to her husband, refused [92]\n\n\nRevolution settlement\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists [88] It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths [94] In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed [97] The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the royal prerogative It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments [88] William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute [98]\n\n\nRule with Mary II\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n\nJacobite resistance\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n\nParliament and faction\nAlthough the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories [105] The Marquess of Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign [106] The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance [107] This \"balanced\" approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year [108]\n\n\nWar in Europe\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn [115] England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance [116] Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life [117]\n\n\nEconomic crisis\nWilliam's rule led to rapid inflation in England, which caused widespread hunger from 1693 onwards [122] The Nine Years' War damaged English maritime trade and led to a doubling in taxation [122] These factors coupled with government mismanagement caused a currency crisis 1695–1697 and a run on the recently created Bank of England [122]\n\n\nLater years\nMary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, aged 32, leaving William III to rule alone [123] William deeply mourned his wife's death [124] Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William's popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch [125]\n\n\nRumours of homosexuality\nDuring the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors [126] He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours, [127] while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, as it was common for someone childless like William to adopt, or evince paternal affections for, a younger man [128]\n\n\nPeace with France\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne The plan failed and support for William surged [131] Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697 [132] In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk (20 September 1697), which ended the Nine Years' War, King Louis XIV recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II [133] Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.\n\n\nEnglish royal succession\nAnother royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights [139] As the complete exhaustion of the defined line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, the English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would pass to a distant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James I), and to her Protestant heirs [140] The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia [140]\n\n\nDeath\nIn 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel It was rumoured that the horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William [141] Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted \"the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat\" [142] Years later, Winston Churchill, in his A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, stated that the fall \"opened the door to a troop of lurking foes\" [143] William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife [144] His sister-in-law and cousin, Anne, became queen regnant of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\n\nLegacy\nHe was a great man, an enemy of France, to which he did a great deal of harm, but we owe him our esteem.\n\nTitles, styles, and arms\nBy 1674, William was fully styled as \"Willem III, by God's grace Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau etc., Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht etc., Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Netherlands\" [160] After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the titles \"King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc.\" [161]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nBy 1674, William was fully styled as \"Willem III, by God's grace Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau etc., Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht etc., Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Netherlands\" [160] After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the titles \"King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc.\" [161]\n\n\nArms\nAs Prince of Orange, William's coat of arms was: Quarterly, I Azure billetty a lion rampant Or (for Nassau); II Or a lion rampant guardant Gules crowned Azure (Katzenelnbogen); III Gules a fess Argent (Vianden), IV Gules two lions passant guardant Or, armed and langued azure (Dietz); between the I and II quarters an inescutcheon, Or a fess Sable (Moers); at the fess point an

Orange, was a Dutch statesman and the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1689 until his death in 1702. He played a crucial role in the Glorious Revolution, which overthrew his father-in-law, King James II, and established a constitutional monarchy in England. William's reign saw significant events, including the War of the Grand Alliance, the Act of Settlement, and the Treaty of Rijswijk.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nWilliam III was born on 4 November 1650 in The Hague, Dutch Republic, to Mary, Princess Royal, and William II, Prince of Orange. His mother was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and his father was the stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, and Utrecht. William's early life was marked by the influence of his governesses, including Walburg Howard and Lady Anna Mackenzie, who taught him the Reformed religion. He received daily instruction in the Reformed faith from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland.\n\n**Birth and Family**\n\nWilliam III was born in The Hague in the Dutch Republic on 4 November 1650. He was the only child of Mary, Princess Royal, and stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange. Mary was the elder daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and sister of kings Charles II and James II and VII.\n\n**Childhood and Education**\n\nWilliam's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses, some of English descent, including Walburg Howard and the Scottish noblewoman Lady Anna Mackenzie. From April 1656, the prince received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis Trigland, a follower of the Contra-Remonstrant theologian Gisbertus Voetius.\n\n**Early Offices**\n\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant. At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder. In 1660, William's mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.\n\n**Exclusion from Stadtholdership**\n\nAfter the death of William's father, most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant. At the demand of Oliver Cromwell, the Treaty of Westminster, which ended the First Anglo-Dutch War, had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion, which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder. In 1660, William's mother Mary and grandmother Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder, but they all initially refused.\n\n**Conflict with Republicans**\n\nIn November 1670, William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2,797,859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange. Charles was unable to pay, but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1,800,000 guilders. Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state.\n\n**Becoming Stadtholder**\n\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous. It became known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne. Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht. On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Waterline on 8 June.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nDuring the war with France, William tried to improve his position by marrying, in 1677, his first cousin Mary, elder surviving daughter of the Duke of York, later King James II of England (James VII of Scotland). Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies.\n\n**Tensions with France, Intrigue with England**\n\nBy 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic. Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"universal kingship\" over Europe; Louis described William as \"my mortal enemy\" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger. France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the Réunion policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic.\n\n**Glorious Revolution**\n\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain. Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade.\n\n**Proclaimed King**\n\nWilliam summoned a Convention Parliament in England, which met on 22 January 1689, to discuss the appropriate course of action following James's flight. William felt insecure about his position; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne, he wished to reign as king in his own right, rather than as a mere consort. The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain.\n\n**Revolution Settlement**\n\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists. It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths. In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed.\n\n**Rule with Mary II**\n\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament. Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs. Nonjurors in England and Scotland, including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen, refused to take oaths of allegiance to William.\n\n**Parliament and Faction**\n\nAlthough the Whigs were William's strongest supporters, he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories. The Marquess of Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign. The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance.\n\n**War in Europe**\n\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn. England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance. Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary, governed the realm, but acted on his advice.\n\n**Economic Crisis**\n\nWilliam's rule led to rapid inflation in England, which caused widespread hunger from 1693 onwards. The Nine Years' War damaged English maritime trade and led to a doubling in taxation. These factors coupled with government mismanagement caused a currency crisis 1695–1697 and a run on the recently created Bank of England.\n\n**Later Years**\n\nMary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, aged 32, leaving William III to rule alone. William deeply mourned his wife's death. Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William's popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch.\n\n**Rumours of Homosexuality**\n\nDuring the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors. He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle.\n\n**Peace with France**\n\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder. In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne. The plan failed and support for William surged. Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697.\n\n**English Royal Succession**\n\nAnother royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William. His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry. Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood. The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights.\n\n**Death**\n\nIn 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel. It was rumoured that the horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William. Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted \"the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat\".\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWilliam III was a great man, an enemy of France, to which he did a great deal of harm, but we owe him our esteem.\n\n**Titles, Styles, and Arms**\n\nBy 1674, William was fully styled as \"Willem III, by God's grace Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau etc., Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht etc., Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Netherlands\". After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the titles \"King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc.\".\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nOrange and Stuart: Family tree\n\n**See Also**\n\nWilliam III of England, William III of the Netherlands, William of Orange\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n1.

his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France, directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as \"sovereign\" of a Dutch rump state [33] In addition to differing political outlooks, William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles Charles and James, who were more concerned with drinking, gambling, and cavorting with mistresses [34]\n\n\nBecoming stadtholder\nFor the Dutch Republic, 1672 proved calamitous It became known as the Rampjaar (\"disaster year\") because in the Franco-Dutch War and the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies: England, Münster, and Cologne Although the Anglo-French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay, in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht On 14 June, William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland, where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Waterline on 8 June [40] Louis XIV of France, believing the war was over, began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible [41] The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic, and the people turned against De Witt and his allies [41]\n\n\n\"Disaster year\" and Franco-Dutch War\nFor the Dutch Republic,

II of England (James VII of Scotland) Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother (another Mary Stuart), but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles's kingdoms, and would draw England's monarch away from his pro-French policies [61] James was not inclined to consent, but Charles II pressured his brother to agree [62] Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war, but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately [63] Charles relented, and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677 [64] Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage, but miscarried After a further illness later in 1678, she never conceived again [65]\n\n\nTensions with France, intrigue with England\nBy 1678, Louis XIV sought peace with the Dutch Republic [67] Even so, tensions remained: William remained suspicious of Louis, thinking that the French king desired \"universal kingship\" over Europe; Louis described William as \"my mortal enemy\" and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger France's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany (the Réunion policy) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic [68] This led William III to join various anti-French alliances, such as the Association League, and ultimately the League of Augsburg (an anti-French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Spain and several German states) in 1686 [69]\n\n\nGlorious Revolution\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688, as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy, and thus unable to mount an attack while William's troops would be occupied in Britain [76] Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader, he demanded in a letter to Rear-Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade [77] In June, Mary of Modena, after a string of miscarriages, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward Stuart, who displaced William's Protestant wife to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy [78] Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects, a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church [79]\n\n\nInvasion of England\nWilliam at first opposed the prospect of invasion, but most

for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century, when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain [90] Philip remained king only during his wife's lifetime, and restrictions were placed on his power William, on the other hand, demanded that he remain as king even after his wife's death [91] When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler, William threatened to leave the country immediately Furthermore, she, remaining loyal to her husband, refused [92]\n\n\nRevolution settlement\nWilliam encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1689, which guaranteed religious toleration to Protestant nonconformists [88] It did not, however, extend toleration as far as he wished, still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics, non-trinitarians, and those of non-Christian faiths [94] In December 1689, one of the most important constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights, was passed [97] The Act, which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right, established restrictions on the royal prerogative It provided, amongst other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments [88] William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints, but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute [98]\n\n\nRule with Mary II\nAlthough most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns, a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne, instead believing in the divine right of kings, which held that the monarch's

Halifax, a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course, gained William's confidence early in his reign [106] The Whigs, a majority in Parliament, had expected to dominate the government, and were disappointed that William denied them this chance [107] This \"balanced\" approach to governance did not last beyond 1690, as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy, and William called for new elections early that year [108]\n\n\nWar in Europe\nWilliam continued to absent himself from Britain for extended periods during his Nine Years' War (1688–1697) against France, leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn [115] England joined the League of Augsburg, which then became known as the Grand Alliance [116] Whilst William was away fighting, his wife, Mary II, governed the realm, but acted on his advice Each time he returned to England, Mary gave up her power to him without reservation, an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary's life [117]\n\n\nEconomic crisis\nWilliam's rule led to rapid inflation in England, which caused widespread hunger from 1693 onwards [122] The Nine Years' War damaged English maritime trade and led to a doubling in taxation [122] These factors coupled with government mismanagement caused a currency crisis 1695–1697 and a run on the recently created Bank of England [122]\n\n\nLater years\nMary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694, aged 32, leaving William III to rule alone [123] William deeply mourned his wife's death [124] Despite his conversion to Anglicanism, William's popularity in England plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch [125]\n\n\nRumours of homosexuality\nDuring the 1690s, rumours grew of William's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors [126] He did have several close male associates, including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles: Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland, and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle These relationships with male friends, and his apparent lack of mistresses, led William's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships William's modern biographers disagree on the veracity of these allegations Some believe there may have been truth to the rumours, [127] while others affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies' imaginations, as it was common for someone childless like William to adopt, or evince paternal affections for, a younger man [128]\n\n\nPeace with France\nIn 1696, the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder In the same year, Jacobites plotted to assassinate William in an attempt to restore James to the English throne The plan failed and support for William surged [131] Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader, John Fenwick, and he was beheaded in 1697 [132] In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk (20 September 1697), which ended the Nine Years' War, King Louis XIV recognised William III as King of England, and undertook to give no further assistance to James II [133] Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697, Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William's reign.\n\n\nEnglish royal succession\nAnother royal inheritance, apart from that of Spain, also concerned William His marriage with Mary had not produced any children, and he did not seem likely to remarry Mary's sister, Anne, had borne numerous children, all of whom died during childhood The death of her last surviving child (Prince William, Duke of Gloucester) in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights [139] As the complete exhaustion of the defined line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II's line, the English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage, the Crown would pass to a distant relative, Sophia, Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of James I), and to her Protestant heirs [140] The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne, thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia The Act extended to England and Ireland, but not to Scotland, whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia [140]\n\n\nDeath\nIn 1702, William died of pneumonia, a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse, Sorrel It was rumoured that the horse had been confiscated from Sir John Fenwick, one of the Jacobites who had conspired against William [141] Because his horse had stumbled into a mole's burrow, many Jacobites toasted \"the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat\" [142] Years later, Winston Churchill, in his A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, stated that the fall \"opened the door to a troop of lurking foes\" [143] William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife [144] His sister-in-law and cousin, Anne, became queen regnant of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\n\nLegacy\nHe was a great man, an enemy of France, to which he did a great deal of harm, but we owe him our esteem.\n\nTitles, styles, and arms\nBy 1674, William was fully styled as \"Willem III, by God's grace Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau etc., Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht etc., Captain- and Admiral-General of the United Netherlands\" [160] After their accession in Great Britain in 1689, William and Mary used the titles \"King and Queen of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, etc.\"

The concept of critical juncture has been influential in various fields, including sociology, political science, economics, and history.\n\n**Origins in the 1960s and early 1970s**\n\nThe idea of episodes of discontinuous change, followed by periods of relative stability, was introduced in various fields of knowledge in the 1960s and early 1970s. This concept marked a significant departure from the dominant perspective of gradual and continuous change that dominated the social sciences at the time.\n\n**Kuhn's Paradigm Shifts**\n\nPhilosopher of science Thomas Kuhn's landmark work \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962) introduced and popularized the idea of discontinuous change and the long-term effects of discontinuous change. Kuhn argued that progress in knowledge occurs at times through sudden jumps, which he called paradigm shifts. After paradigm shifts, scholars do normal science within paradigms, which endure until a new revolution came about.\n\n**Gellner's Neo-Episodic Model of Change**\n\nAnthropologist Ernest Gellner proposed a neo-episodic model of change in 1964 that highlights the \"step-like nature of history\" and the \"remarkable discontinuity\" between different historical periods. Gellner contrasts the neo-episodic model of change to an evolutionary model that portrays \"the pattern of Western history\" as a process of \"continuous and sustained and mainly endogenous upward growth.\"\n\n**Lipset and Rokkan's Critical Junctures**\n\nSociologist Seymour Lipset and political scientist Stein Rokkan introduced the idea of critical junctures and their long-term impact in the social sciences in 1967. The ideas presented in the coauthored 1967 work were elaborated by Rokkan in \"Citizens, Elections, and Parties\" (1970).\n\n**Gould's Punctuated Equilibrium Model**\n\nKuhn's ideas influenced paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who introduced the idea of punctuated equilibrium in the field of evolutionary biology in 1972. Gould's initial work on punctuated equilibrium was coauthored with Niles Eldredge.\n\n**The Critical Juncture Theoretical Framework in the Social Sciences**\n\nSince its launching in 1967, research on critical junctures has focused in part on developing a theoretical framework, which has evolved over time. The critical juncture approach has been applied to various fields, including state formation, political regimes, regime change and democracy, party system, public policy, government performance, and economic development.\n\n**Developments in the Late 1960s-Early 1970s**\n\nKey ideas in critical junctures research were initially introduced in the 1960s and early 1970s by Seymour Lipset, Stein Rokkan, and Arthur Stinchcombe. These scholars laid the groundwork for the development of the critical juncture framework, which has since been refined and expanded upon by numerous researchers.\n\n**Developments in the Early 1980s-Early 1990s**\n\nAdditional contributions were made in the 1980s and early 1990s by various political scientists and economists. These researchers further developed the critical juncture framework, introducing new concepts and applications that have helped to solidify its place in the social sciences.\n\n**Debates in the 2000s-2010s**\n\nFollowing a period of consolidation of the critical juncture framework, few new developments occurred in the 1990s. However, since around 2000, several new ideas were proposed and many aspects of the critical junctures framework are the subject of debate. Researchers have engaged in discussions about the definition and scope of critical junctures, as well as the appropriate methods for analyzing and measuring their impact.\n\n**Substantive Applications in the Social Sciences**\n\nA critical juncture approach has been used in the study of many fields of research, including state formation, political regimes, regime change and democracy, party system, public policy, government performance, and economic development. The framework has been applied to various regions and time periods, allowing researchers to identify and analyze the long-term effects of critical junctures on social, economic, and political outcomes.\n\n**Examples of Research**\n\nBarrington Moore Jr.'s \"Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World\" (1966) argues that revolutions (the critical junctures) occurred in different ways (bourgeois revolutions, revolutions from above, and revolutions from below) and this difference led to contrasting political regimes in the long term (the legacy)—democracy, fascism, and communism, respectively. In contrast to the unilinear view of evolution common in the 1960s, Moore showed that countries followed multiple paths to modernity.\n\n**Debates in Research**\n\nCritical juncture research typically contrasts an argument about the historical origins of some outcome to an explanation based in temporally proximate factors. However, researchers have engaged in debates about what historical event should be considered a critical juncture. Some scholars argue that critical junctures are rare and limited to specific periods or events, while others contend that they are more widespread and can be identified in various configurations.\n\n**Reception and Impact**\n\nResearch on critical junctures is generally seen as an important contribution to the social sciences. The framework has been influential in various fields, including sociology, political science, economics, and history. The critical juncture approach has helped to shed light on the long-term effects of historical events and has provided a new perspective on the development of societies, institutions, and economies.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Social sciences\n* History\n* Economics\n* Sociology\n* Political science\n\n**Notes and References**\n\nThis article does not include citations or references.

Born in Sydney, Australia, Tuivasa grew up in the western suburb of Mount Druitt with 11 siblings. He has a complex and storied career, marked by both triumph and adversity.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTuivasa was born in Sydney to an Indigenous Australian mother of Wiradjuri descent and a Samoan father. Growing up in the western Sydney suburb of Mount Druitt, he was one of 12 children in a close-knit family. Tuivasa's early life was marked by a strong connection to his cultural heritage, with his mother playing a significant role in teaching him about his Indigenous Australian roots. His father, a Samoan immigrant, instilled in him a strong sense of resilience and determination.\n\n**Mixed Martial Arts Career**\n\nTuivasa's journey in mixed martial arts began when he was signed by the professional Sydney Roosters rugby league club in 2010. However, his initial foray into professional sports was cut short due to a gambling addiction, which forced him to take a break from the sport. Undeterred, Tuivasa redirected his focus towards mixed martial arts, making his professional debut in August 2012 in his native Australia. Over the next four years, he fought sporadically, amassing an impressive record of knockouts.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nTuivasa's early career was marked by a series of victories, with all of his wins ending in knockouts. This impressive start set the tone for his future success in the sport. During this period, Tuivasa honed his skills and developed a unique fighting style that would eventually earn him a spot in the UFC.\n\n**Ultimate Fighting Championship**\n\nIn November 2016, Tuivasa signed a four-fight contract with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, marking a significant milestone in his career. According to Tuivasa, he had to sit out for an extended period due to a knee injury and subsequent surgery. This setback proved to be a blessing in disguise, as it allowed him to reassess his training and approach to the sport.\n\n**Championships and Accomplishments**\n\nTuivasa's achievements in the UFC have been notable, with a string of impressive victories under his belt. His ability to finish fights with knockouts has earned him a reputation as a formidable opponent in the heavyweight division. While he has yet to capture a championship title, Tuivasa remains a force to be reckoned with in the UFC.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nTuivasa has a son with Brierley Pedro, the sister of former UFC light heavyweight fighter Tyson Pedro. This connection to the Pedro family has been an important part of Tuivasa's life, both personally and professionally.\n\n**Mixed Martial Arts Record**\n\n| Date | Opponent | Event | Result | Method | Round | Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012-08-18 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2013-02-22 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 2 |  |\n| 2014-06-13 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2015-09-18 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 2 |  |\n| 2017-02-11 |  |  | Loss | Submission | 2 |  |\n| 2017-06-17 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2018-03-10 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 2 |  |\n| 2018-09-15 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2019-06-22 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2020-03-14 |  |  | Loss | Decision | 3 |  |\n\n**Professional Boxing Record**\n\n| Date | Opponent | Event | Result | Method | Round | Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015-11-21 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 2 |  |\n\n**Kickboxing Record**\n\n| Date | Opponent | Event | Result | Method | Round | Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014-03-22 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2016-04-16 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 2 |  |\n\n**MMA Mixed Rules Record**\n\n| Date | Opponent | Event | Result | Method | Round | Time |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015-08-15 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 1 |  |\n| 2017-01-21 |  |  | Win | KO/TKO | 2 |  |\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of current UFC fighters\n* List of mixed martial artists\n* Heavyweight MMA fighters\n\n**Notes**\n\nTuivasa's career has been marked by both triumph and adversity.

His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani, directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu, and Jalal Agha.

He was offered to play dual roles by director O P Goyle and writer O P Ralhan for the film Bandhe Haath in 1973. This was the first movie in which Bachchan played a double role. Bachchan was then discovered by screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay, and script of Zanjeer (1973), and conceived the \"angry young man\" persona of the lead role. Javed Akhtar came on board as co-writer, and Prakash Mehra, who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film's director. However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead \"angry young man\" role; it was turned down by several actors, owing to it going against the \"romantic hero\" image dominant in the industry at the time.

This was also the year in which Bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan. The first was Deewaar, directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, and Neetu Singh. The film emerged a huge blockbuster at the box office and earned him another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. Indiatimes ranks Deewaar among the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. The other, released on 15 August 1975, was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time, in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. Deewaar and Sholay are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with Zanjeer, and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, BBC India declared Sholay the \"Film of the Millennium,\" and, like Deewaar, it has been cited by Indiatimes Movies as among the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films. In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years.\n\nHealth Issues\n-------------\n\nHe was later diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis. The illness weakened him both mentally and physically. At this time, he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, \"Yeh film to flop hogi!\" (\"This film will flop\"). He then decided to quit films and ventured into politics.\n\nCareer Fluctuations, Sabbatical, Business Ventures, and Acting Comeback (1989-1999)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the success of his comeback film, however, Bachchan's star power began to wane as his subsequent releases like Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswati, Jaadugar, Toofan, and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) did not do well commercially. He gained success during this period with superhits in K.C. Bokadia's crime drama film Aaj Ka Arjun (1990) and Mukul Anand's masala film Hum (1991), but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite a decline in the number of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the cult film Agneepath (1990). These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of the critically acclaimed epic Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. Except for the much-delayed Insaniyat (1994) alongside Sunny Deol, which was highly anticipated and received the biggest opening of the year but turned out to be a box office failure due to negative reception, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.\n\nReturn to Success (2000-Present)\n-------------------------------\n\nIn 2000, Bachchan appeared in Aditya Chopra's romantic blockbuster Mohabbatein. He played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan. His role won him his third Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.. (2001), and Baghban (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in Aks (2001), Aankhen (2002), Kaante (2002), Khakee (2004), Dev (2004), and Veer-Zaara (2004). His performance in Aks won him his first Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.\n\nOther Works\n------------\n\nIn 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), the Indian adaptation of the British television game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? The show was well received. A second season followed in 2005 but its run was cut short by Star Plus when Bachchan fell ill in 2006. He then returned to host the fourth season, and has hosted the show since.\n\nVoice Acting\n-------------\n\nBachchan is known for his deep, baritone voice. He has been a narrator, a playback singer, and a presenter for numerous programs. Some prominent films featuring his narration are Satyajit Ray's 1977 film Shatranj Ke Khiladi and Ashutosh Gowarikar's 2001 film Lagaan.\n\nBusiness Investments\n-------------------\n\nAround 1994, Bachchan started Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd (ABCL), an event management, production, and distribution company. However, the company fell into debt with a fiasco and went into bankruptcy. Bachchan became nearly bankrupt. The reasons for this debacle were films that fared poorly at the box office, such as Mrityudata and Major Saab (produced by this organization), and Miss World 1996, which was organized-managed by ABCL. Due to this, he began work for TV and asked for work from Yash Chopra. Once he said that \"it was the darkest time for him.\"\n\nPolitical Career\n----------------\n\nIn 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of a long-time family friend, Rajiv Gandhi. He contested the Allahabad's (presently Prayagraj) Lok Sabha constituency seat for the 8th Lok Sabha against H.N. Bahuguna, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. With 68.2% of the votes in his favor, he won by one of the highest victory margins ever in Indian elections. In 1987, Indian Express said his brother Ajitabh Bachchan owned an apartment in Switzerland, giving rise to speculations about his involvement in the \"Bofors scandal,\" revealed in the year before. Bachchan resigned from his seat in July 1987. Ajitabh Bachchan sued Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter for linking him to Bofors payments in 1990 and won damages in the United Kingdom. Sten Lindstrom, the Swedish police chief who had investigated the case, said in 2012 that \"Indian investigators planted the Bachchan angle on\" Dagens Nyheter.\n\nHumanitarian and Social Causes\n-------------------------------\n\nBachchan has been involved with many social causes. For example, he donated ₹1.1 million to clear the debts of nearly 40 beleaguered farmers in Andhra Pradesh and ₹3 million to clear the debts of some 100 Vidarbha farmers. In 2010, he donated ₹1.1 million to Resul Pookutty's foundation for a medical center at Kochi. He has given ₹250,000 to the family of Delhi policeman Subhash Chand Tomar who died after succumbing to injuries during a protest against gang-rape after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case. He founded the Harivansh Rai Bachchan Memorial Trust, named after his father, in 2013. This trust, in association with Urja Foundation, will be powering 3,000 homes in India with electricity through solar energy.\n\nPersonal Life\n----------------\n\nBachchan has been married to veteran actress and politician Jaya Bhaduri since 3 June 1973. Together, they have two children: Shweta, an author, journalist, and former model, and Abhishek, an actor and producer. Abhishek married actress Aishwarya Rai, and they have a daughter named Aaradhya.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nBachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema.

family\nBachchan was born on 11 October 1942 in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) to Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and social activist Teji Bachchan [23] Harivansh Rai Bachchan was an Awadhi Hindu Kayastha, [24] who was fluent in Awadhi, [25] Hindi and Urdu [26] Harivansh's ancestors came from a village called Babupatti, in the Raniganj tehsil, in the Pratapgarh district, in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh, in India [27] Teji Bachchan was a Punjabi Sikh Khatri from Lyallpur, Punjab, British India (present-day Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan) [25] [28] Bachchan has a younger brother, Ajitabh, who is five years younger than him [29]\n\n\nActing career\nBachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award–winning film Bhuvan Shome [45] His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat Hindustani, [46] directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal Agha [47] [48] Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971) Following Parwana were several films, including Reshma Aur Shera (1971) During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri He narrated part of the film Bawarchi [49] In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa directed by S Ramanathan which was moderately successful [50] Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well [51] His only film with Mala Sinha, Sanjog (1972) was also a box office failure [52]\n\n\nEarly career (1969–1972)\nBachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award–winning film Bhuvan Shome [45] His first acting role was as one of

which was moderately successful [50] Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well [51] His only film with Mala Sinha, Sanjog (1972) was also a box office failure [52]\n\n\nRise to prominence (1973–1974)\nBachchan was struggling, seen as a \"failed newcomer\" who, by the age of 30, had twelve commercial failures and only two successes (as a lead in Bombay to Goa and a supporting role in Anand) [citation needed] He was offered to play dual roles by director O P Goyle and writer O P Ralhan for the film Bandhe Haath in 1973 This was the first movie in which Bachchan played a double role [53] Bachchan was then discovered by screenwriter duo Salim–Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar [54] Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of Zanjeer (1973), and conceived the \"angry young man\" persona of the lead role Javed Akhtar came on board as co-writer, [55] and Prakash Mehra, who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film's director However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead \"angry young man\" role; it was turned down by several actors, owing to it going against the \"romantic hero\" image dominant in the industry at the time [54] Salim-Javed \"saw his talent, which most makers didn't He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren't good.\" [56] According to Salim Khan, they \"strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for Zanjeer\" [54] Salim Khan introduced Bachchan to Prakash Mehra, [55] and Salim-Javed insisted that Bachchan be cast for the role [54]\n\n\nSuperstardom (1975–1988)\nIn 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy Chupke Chupke and the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili [71] This was also the year in which Bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan [56] The first was Deewaar, directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, and Neetu Singh The film emerged a huge blockbuster at the box office and earned him another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor [72] Indiatimes ranks Deewaar among the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films [73] The other, released on 15 August 1975, was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at the time, [74] in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev Deewaar and Sholay are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with Zanjeer, and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s [75] [76] In 1999, BBC India declared Sholay the \"Film of the Millennium\" and, like Deewaar, it has been cited by Indiatimes Movies as among the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films [73] In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years.\n\n\nHealth issues\nHe was later diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis The illness weakened him both mentally and physically At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, \"Yeh film to flop hogi!\" (\"This film will flop\") [101] He then decided to quit films and ventured into politics.\n\n\nCareer fluctuations, sabbatical, business ventures and acting comeback (1989–1999)\nAfter the success of his comeback film however, Bachchan's star power began to wane as his subsequent releases like Gangaa Jamunaa Saraswati, Jaadugar, Toofan and Main Azaad Hoon (all released in 1989) did not do well commercially [102] [103] [104] He gained success during this period with superhits in K.C Bokadia's crime drama film Aaj Ka Arjun (1990) and Mukul Anand's masala film Hum (1991), but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued [105] Notably, despite a decline in number of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance as a Mafia don in the cult film Agneepath (1990) [106] These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time After the release of the critically acclaimed epic Khuda Gawah in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years Except for the much delayed Insaniyat (1994) alongside Sunny Deol, which was highly anticipated and received the biggest opening of the year but turned out to be a box office failure due to negative reception, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years [107] [108]\n\n\nReturn to success (2000–present)\nIn 2000, Bachchan appeared in Aditya Chopra's romantic blockbuster Mohabbatein [120] He played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan [121] His role won him his third Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor [122] Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.. (2001) and Baghban (2003) As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in Aks (2001), Aankhen (2002), Kaante (2002), Khakee (2004), Dev (2004) and Veer-Zaara (2004) His performance in Aks won him his first Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor [123]\n\n\nOther works\nIn 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), the Indian adaptation of the British television game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? The show was well received [172] A second season followed in 2005 but its run was cut short by Star Plus when Bachchan fell ill in 2006 [173] He then returned to host the fourth season, and has hosted the show since [174]\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nIn 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), the Indian adaptation of the British television game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

Mackay was sixteen when his mother died the following year His early education and training at this time was subsequently largely through his father's efforts The Mackay family lived in a simple house in the countryside, as his father at that time had not taken residence in a Manse He was himself once an enthusiastic student, who had developed into a man of marked ability Inclined towards working around machinery rather than playing with his companions, the younger Mackay was his father's constant companion, especially during his walks to the village forge, gas works, carding mill, and other shops His father, however, had mixed feelings about his son's worldly interests, hoping that he would instead aspire to a more religious vocation [1] [2] [3] Mackay's father was also a member of the Royal Geographical Society and an author whose works included a manual on geography, published in 1861, and those in other related fields [4]\n\n\nMissionary life\nMackay decided to become a missionary after Henry Morton Stanley was told by King Mutesa I of Buganda that Uganda needed missionaries, and who sent a latter to this effect to The Daily Telegraph in 1875 describing the need and asking for missionaries [12]  [13] At the age of twenty-six, he subsequently joined the Church Missionary Society in 1876, which assigned him to serve in a missionary station in Uganda Beginning on April 27,1876, he sailed aboard the S.S Peshawur from Southampton, England, and arrived on the island of Zanzibar on May 30, some fifty miles off the east coast of Tanzania At  Mpwapwa they collected the necessary equipment, and made preliminary plans for their eight-hundred mile trek across Tanzania to the south end of Lake Victoria On the journey Mackay came down with an acute case of fever and had to return to the coast, carried in a hammock most of  the way back to Mpwapwa, [14] while the other members of the party continued on, making their way to the lake, where they put together a vessel, named Daisy, for crossing the lake north to Uganda After Mackay recovered he organized a labor party and began outfitting a caravan of about seventy loads, and placed it in charge of an Englishman named Morton In one-hundred days Mackay built a 230 mile wagon road to from Sadani on the coast to Mpwapwa, having to deal with many difficulties through the dense jungle and brush After

had cut off Equatoria from the outside world, forcing the Governor, Emin Pasha of Egypt  to flee south to Uganda to avoid capture Here he corresponded with Mackay and others in an effort to procure aid, which ultimately brought the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and the  Emin Pasha Relief Expedition to his rescue During the expedition Stanley met Mackay in 1889 for the first time at the Usambiro mission station when the former was escorting Emin Pasha, the besieged Egyptian governor of Equatoria [e] and the other refugees back to safety [38] It was Mackay, through his letter writing, in October 1886, reporting back to England, that provided the first news that Emin Pasha was still alive   Mackay had also corresponded with Emin Pasha, and encouraged him to write letters to Dr Robert

Mackay was sixteen when his mother died the following year His early education and training at this time was subsequently largely through his father's efforts The Mackay family lived in a simple house in the countryside, as his father at that time had not taken residence in a Manse He was himself once an enthusiastic student, who had developed into a man of marked ability Inclined towards working around machinery rather than playing with his companions, the younger Mackay was his father's constant companion, especially during his walks to the village forge, gas works, carding mill, and other shops His father, however, had mixed feelings about his son's worldly interests, hoping that he would instead aspire to a more religious vocation [1] [2] [3] Mackay's father was also a member of the Royal Geographical Society and an author whose works included a manual on geography, published in 1861, and those in other related fields [4]\n\n\nMissionary life\nMackay decided to become a missionary after Henry Morton Stanley was told by King Mutesa I of Buganda that Uganda needed missionaries, and who sent a latter to this effect to The Daily Telegraph in 1875 describing the need and asking for missionaries [12]  [13] At the age of twenty-six, he subsequently joined the Church Missionary Society in 1876, which assigned him to serve in a missionary station in Uganda Beginning on April 27,1876, he sailed aboard the S.S Peshawur from Southampton, England, and arrived on the island of Zanzibar on May 30, some fifty miles off the east coast of Tanzania At  Mpwapwa they collected the necessary equipment, and made preliminary plans for their eight-hundred mile trek across Tanzania to the south end of Lake Victoria On the journey Mackay came down with an acute case of fever and had to return to the coast, carried in a hammock most of  the way back to Mpwapwa, [14] while the other members of the party continued on, making their way to the lake, where they put together a vessel, named Daisy, for crossing the lake north to Uganda After Mackay recovered he organized a labor party and began outfitting a caravan of about seventy loads, and placed it in charge of an Englishman named Morton In one-hundred days Mackay built a 230 mile wagon road to from Sadani on the coast to Mpwapwa, having to deal with many difficulties through the dense jungle and brush After everyone had finally regrouped they crossed the lake.to Uganda, arriving there in November 1878 [15] [16] [17] [18]\n\n\nEmin Pasha Relief Expedition\nThe revolt of Muhammad Ahmad that began in 1881 had cut off Equatoria from the outside world, forcing the Governor, Emin Pasha of Egypt  to flee south to Uganda to avoid capture Here he corresponded with Mackay and others in an effort to procure aid, which ultimately brought the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and the  Emin Pasha Relief Expedition to his rescue During the expedition Stanley met Mackay in 1889 for the first time at the Usambiro mission station when the former was escorting Emin Pasha, the besieged Egyptian governor of Equatoria [e] and the other refugees back to safety [38] It was Mackay, through his letter writing, in October 1886, reporting back to England, that provided the first news that Emin Pasha was still alive   Mackay had also corresponded with Emin Pasha, and encouraged him to write letters to Dr Robert Felkin, [f] Consul-General, and Frederick Holmwood a medical missionary in Zanzibar, if he thought it best to get England's support  Writing to Emin Pasha, Mackay wrote,\n\n\nFinal days and legacy\nMackay continued to work in Uganda until 1890 Unaware of the pending fever caused by Malaria that would ultimately cause his death, [i] Mackay translated the 14th chapter of the Gospel of  John into the Luganda language [44] During his last few days at his station in Usambiro, at the south end of Lake Victoria, Mackay began to show the worst symptoms caused by the fever, with Mr Deeks at his side, who was preparing to return to England because of ill health but decided to stay with Mackay The care given to Mackay was now left  to -*-untrained Waganda Christians who did all they could comfort him and  cool his fever [45] Deekes sent for a French priest at Ukumbi, but he arrived too late [46] Still more concerned for others, Mackay had asked if Stanley and his party had been well provided for Days later he died on February 4, 1890, 11.00 PM, at the age of 40 [j] A coffin was promptly made using some of the wood Mackay had prepared for the boat, and at two o'clock on the following Sunday Mr Deekes buried him by the shores of Lake Nyanza (Victoria) which he had always admired The Baganda Christians and the boys of the village stood around and the grave and sang Gospel hymns [48] [49]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

War II, many people in the United States felt a fervent desire to \"restore the prewar social order and hold off the forces of change\", according to historian Barry Adam [6] Spurred by the national emphasis on anti-communism, Senator Joseph McCarthy conducted hearings searching for communists in the U.S government, the U.S Army, and other government-funded agencies and institutions, leading to a national paranoia Anarchists, communists, and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks Gay men and lesbians were included in this list by the U.S State Department on the theory that they were susceptible to blackmail In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by Clyde R Hoey noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\", [7] and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\" [8] Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals [9]\n\n\nHomophile activism\nIn response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested Los Angeles area homosexuals created the Mattachine Society in 1950, in the home of communist activist Harry Hay [16] Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles [17] Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals [18] [19] Soon after, several women in San Francisco met in their living rooms to form the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) for lesbians [20] Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine and urged their members to assimilate into general society [21]\n\n\nEarlier resistance and riots\nOn the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who challenged gender expectations They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people who dressed and lived in contrast to their sex assigned at birth, either part or full-time Contemporaneous nomenclature classified them as transvestites and they were the most visible representatives of sexual minorities They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people [29] The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate.\n\n\nGreenwich Village\nThe Manhattan neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and Harlem were home to sizable gay and lesbian populations after World War I, when people who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities The enclaves of gay men and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as \"short-haired women and long-haired men\", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades [33] Prohibition inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, speakeasies and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all [34] However, police raids continued, resulting in the closure of iconic establishments such as Eve's Hangout in 1926 [35]\n\n\nStonewall Inn\nThe Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the Genovese crime family [4] In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff known as a gayola, as the Stonewall Inn had no liquor license [43] [44] It had no running water behind the bar—dirty glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused [42] There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently [45] Though the bar was not used for prostitution, drug sales and other black market activities took place It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed; [46] dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club [47]\n\n\nRiots\nAt 1:20 a.m on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced \"Police! We're taking the place!\" [58] Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen entered the bar early that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal Once ready, the undercover officers called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom [note 3] The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on Approximately 200 people were in the bar that night Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors Michael Fader remembered, \"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\" [58]\n\n\nPolice raid\nAt 1:20 a.m on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced \"Police! We're taking the place!\" [58] Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen entered the bar early that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal Once ready, the undercover officers called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom [note 3] The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on Approximately 200 people were in the bar that night Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors Michael Fader remembered, \"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\" [58]\n\n\nViolence breaks out\nThe police tried to restrain some of the crowd, knocking a few people down, which incited bystanders even more Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses) [note 5] [74] As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because \"they didn't pay off the cops\", to which someone else yelled, \"Let's pay them off!\" [75] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted \"Pigs!\" and \"Faggot cops!\" Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600 people, grabbed several people, including activist folk singer (and mentor of Bob Dylan) Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me and that's why I stayed in .. Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another.\" [75] Van Ronk was the first of thirteen arrested that night [76] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a column writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.\n\n\nEscalation\nThe Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall One officer's eye was cut and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive:\n\n\nSecond night of rioting\nDuring the siege of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called The New York Times, the New York Post, and the Daily News to tell them what was happening All three papers covered the riots; the Daily News placed coverage on the front page News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\" [55] All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn Graffiti appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\" and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting and—regarding the status of the bar—\"We are open.\" [55] [104]\n\n\nLeaflets, press coverage, and more violence\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday, June 30, and Tuesday, July 1, partly due to rain Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\" [112] [113]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picket in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties and all marched quietly in organized lines [120] This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches [121] [122] Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\" [121] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day [123]\n\n\nGay Liberation Front\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\" [124] [note 11] When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! Bullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\" [125] With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\", [125] the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use gay in its name Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names [126]\n\n\nGay Activists Alliance\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called Gay; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city—The Village Voice—refused to print the word gay in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers [130] Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: Come Out! and Gay Power; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000 [131] [132]\n\n\nGay Pride\nChristopher Street Liberation Day, on June 28, 1970, marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in Los Angeles and Chicago, these were the first Gay Pride marches in US history [139] [140] The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris, West Berlin and Stockholm [141] The march in New York covered 51 blocks, from Christopher Street to Central Park The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers [142] The New York Times reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks [143] Reporting by The Village Voice was positive, describing \"the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago\" [141]\n\n\nTrans organizations\nAccording to Susan Stryker's book, Transgender History, the Stonewall riots had significant effects on trans rights activism Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization, as they believed that trans people weren't being adequately represented in the Gay Activists Alliance and Gay Liberation Front They established politicized versions of \"houses\", which came from Black and Latino queer communities, and were places that marginalized trans youth could seek shelter [150]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Stonewall riots are often considered to be the origin or impetus of the gay liberation movement, and many studies of LGBTQ history in the U.S are divided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses [144] This has been criticized by historians of sexuality Calls for the rights of gender and sexual minorities predate the Stonewall riots The first homosexual movement began one hundred years earlier, in Germany West Germany had abolished criminal liability for homosexual acts among adults over 21 years of age through a change of Section 175 of the German Criminal Code on June 25, 1969 − just three days before the Stonewall riots began [151] There was already the emergence of a gay liberation movement in New York at the time of the riots The Stonewall riots were not the only time LGBTQ people organized politically amid attacks on LGBTQ establishments The event has been said to occupy a unique place in the collective memory of many LGBTQ people, [144] including those outside of the United States, [152] as it \"is marked by an international commemorative ritual – an annual gay pride parade\", according to sociologist Elizabeth A Armstrong [144]\n\n\nCommunity\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots, there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as in Canada, Australia, and Western Europe [153] People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their same-sex attraction Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place [154] Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\" [155] Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust [156]\n\n\nRejection of prior gay subculture\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior gay and lesbian culture, such as bar

Introduction\n\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ community in response to a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's Greenwich Village. The riots, which took place on June 28-29, 1969, are widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the modern LGBTQ rights movement. This article will provide an overview of the events leading up to the riots, the riots themselves, and their impact on the LGBTQ community and beyond.\n\n# Background\n\nFollowing the social upheaval of World War II, many people in the United States felt a fervent desire to \"restore the prewar social order and hold off the forces of change.\" Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist crusade had created a national paranoia, with anarchists, communists, and other people deemed un-American and subversive being considered security risks. Gay men and lesbians were included in this list, with the U.S. State Department believing that they were susceptible to blackmail.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals. This climate of fear and persecution led to the formation of two organizations, the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis, which aimed to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide opportunities for them to socialize without fear of arrest.\n\n## Homosexuality in 20th-century United States\n\nThe post-war period saw a significant increase in the number of people identifying as gay or lesbian. However, this newfound visibility was met with a wave of anti-gay laws and policies, including the 1953 sodomy laws that made it a crime for both men and women to engage in same-sex relationships. The Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis faced enormous opposition to their radical approach, and they eventually shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability.\n\n## Earlier resistance and riots\n\nOn the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people who dressed and lived in contrast to their sex assigned at birth, either part or full-time. Contemporaneous nomenclature classified them as transvestites and they were the most visible representatives of sexual minorities.\n\n## Greenwich Village\n\nThe Manhattan neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and Harlem were home to sizable gay and lesbian populations after World War I. The enclaves of gay men and lesbians developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades. Prohibition inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral.\n\n## Stonewall Inn\n\nThe Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, was a gay bar owned by the Genovese crime family. In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals. The bar had no liquor license, and the owners paid a weekly \"gayola\" to the police to avoid raids.\n\n## Riots\n\nAt 1:20 a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen, two patrol officers, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced \"Police! We're taking the place!\" The music was turned off, and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 200 people were in the bar that night.\n\nThe police tried to restrain some of the crowd, knocking a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended. As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible.\n\n## Escalation\n\nThe Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive.\n\n## Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence\n\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday, June 30, and Tuesday, July 1, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\"\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picket in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia.\n\n## Gay Liberation Front\n\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\" When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! Bullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"\n\nWith a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\", the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use gay in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.\n\n## Gay Activists Alliance\n\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called Gay; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city—The Village Voice—refused to print the word gay in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers. Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: Come Out! and Gay Power; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.\n\n## Christopher Street Liberation Day\n\nOn June 28, 1970, the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots was marked with an assembly on Christopher Street, simultaneous Gay Pride marches in Los Angeles and Chicago, and the first Gay Pride marches in US history. The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris, West Berlin, and Stockholm.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Stonewall riots are often considered to be the origin or impetus of the gay liberation movement, and many studies of LGBTQ history in the U.S. are divided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses. This has been criticized by historians of sexuality, who argue that calls for the rights of gender and sexual minorities predate the Stonewall riots.\n\n## Community\n\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots, there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as in Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their same-sex attraction. Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots.\n\n## Rejection of prior gay subculture\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior gay and lesbian culture, such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian Martin Duberman writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"\n\n## Impact and recognition\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation.\"\n\n## Stonewall Day\n\nIn 2018, 49 years after the uprising, Stonewall Day was announced as a commemoration day by Pride Live, a social advocacy and community engagement organization. The second Stonewall Day was held on Friday, June 28, 2019, outside the Stonewall Inn.\n\n## Historic landmark and monument\n\nIn June 1999, the US Department of the Interior included 51 and 53 Christopher Street and the surrounding area in Greenwich Village into the National Register of Historic Places, the first of significance to the LGBTQ community. In a dedication ceremony, Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior John Berry stated, \"Let it forever be remembered that here—on this spot—men and women stood proud, they stood fast, so that we may be who we are, we may work where we will, live where we choose, and love whom our hearts desire.\"\n\nThe Stonewall Inn was also named a National Historic Landmark in February 2000.\n\n## Media representations\n\nNo newsreel or TV footage was taken of the riots, and few home movies and photographs exist, but those that do have been used in documentaries.", "prompt": "Write a complete

blackmail In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by Clyde R Hoey noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\", [7] and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\" [8] Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals [9]\n\n\nHomosexuality in 20th-century

were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals [9]\n\n\nHomophile activism\nIn response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested Los Angeles area homosexuals created the Mattachine Society in 1950, in the home of communist activist Harry Hay [16] Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles [17] Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals [18] [19] Soon after, several women in San Francisco met in their living rooms to form the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) for lesbians [20] Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine and urged their members to assimilate into general society [21]\n\n\nEarlier resistance and riots\nOn the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who challenged gender expectations They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people who dressed and lived in contrast to their sex assigned at birth, either part or full-time Contemporaneous nomenclature classified them as transvestites and they were the most visible representatives of sexual minorities They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people [29] The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate.\n\n\nGreenwich Village\nThe Manhattan neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and Harlem were home to sizable gay and lesbian populations after World War I, when people who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities The enclaves of gay men and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as \"short-haired women and long-haired men\", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades [33] Prohibition inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, speakeasies and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all [34] However, police raids continued, resulting in the closure of iconic establishments such as Eve's Hangout in 1926 [35]\n\n\nStonewall Inn\nThe Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the Genovese crime family [4] In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff known as a gayola, as the Stonewall Inn had no liquor license [43] [44] It had no running water behind the bar—dirty glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused [42] There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently [45] Though the bar was not used for prostitution, drug sales and other black market activities took place It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed; [46] dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club [47]\n\n\nRiots\nAt 1:20 a.m on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced \"Police! We're taking the place!\" [58] Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen entered the bar early that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal Once ready, the undercover officers called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom [note 3] The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on Approximately 200 people were in the bar that night Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors Michael Fader remembered, \"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\" [58]\n\n\nPolice raid\nAt 1:20 a.m on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced \"Police!

Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another.\" [75] Van Ronk was the first of thirteen arrested that night [76] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a column writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.\n\n\nEscalation\nThe Tactical Patrol Force (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall One officer's eye was cut and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive:\n\n\nSecond night of rioting\nDuring the siege of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called The New York Times, the New York Post, and the Daily News to tell them what was happening All three papers covered the riots; the Daily News placed coverage on the front page News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers, or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\" [55] All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn Graffiti appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\" and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting and—regarding the status of the bar—\"We are open.\" [55] [104]\n\n\nLeaflets, press coverage, and more violence\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday, June 30, and Tuesday, July 1, partly due to rain Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\" [112] [113]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picket in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties and all marched quietly in organized lines [120] This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches [121] [122] Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\" [121] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day [123]\n\n\nGay Liberation Front\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\" [124] [note 11] When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet!

Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names [126]\n\n\nGay Activists Alliance\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called Gay; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city—The Village Voice—refused to print the word gay in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers [130] Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: Come Out! and Gay Power; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000 [131] [132]\n\n\nGay Pride\nChristopher Street Liberation Day, on June 28, 1970, marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in Los Angeles and Chicago, these were the first Gay Pride marches in US history [139] [140] The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris, West Berlin and Stockholm [141] The march in New York covered 51 blocks, from Christopher Street to Central Park The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers [142] The New York Times reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks [143] Reporting by The Village Voice was positive, describing \"the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago\" [141]\n\n\nTrans organizations\nAccording to Susan Stryker's book, Transgender History, the Stonewall riots had significant effects on trans rights activism Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization, as they believed that trans people weren't being adequately represented in the Gay Activists Alliance and Gay Liberation Front They established politicized versions of \"houses\", which came from Black and Latino queer communities, and were places that marginalized trans youth could seek shelter [150]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Stonewall riots are often considered to be the origin or impetus of the gay liberation movement, and many studies of LGBTQ history in the U.S are divided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses [144] This has been criticized by historians of sexuality Calls for the rights of gender and sexual minorities predate the Stonewall riots The first homosexual movement began one hundred years earlier, in Germany West Germany had abolished criminal liability for homosexual acts among adults over 21 years of age through a change of Section 175 of the German Criminal Code on June 25, 1969 − just three days before the Stonewall riots began [151] There was already the emergence of a gay liberation movement in New York at the time of the riots The Stonewall riots were not the only time LGBTQ people organized politically amid attacks on LGBTQ establishments The event has been said to occupy a unique place in the collective memory of many LGBTQ people, [144] including those outside of the United States, [152] as it \"is marked by an international commemorative ritual – an annual gay pride parade\", according to sociologist Elizabeth A Armstrong [144]\n\n\nCommunity\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots, there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as in Canada, Australia, and Western Europe [153] People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their same-sex attraction Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place [154] Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\" [155] Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust [156]\n\n\nRejection of prior gay subculture\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior gay and lesbian culture, such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied Historian Martin Duberman writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall .. continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\" [168] Sociologist Barry Adam notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\" [169] In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of butch and femme that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\" [170] Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior [171] Some women, according to Lillian Faderman, were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall [172]\n\n\nImpact and recognition\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back and a symbolic call to arms for many people Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\" [175] The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\" [176] Historian Nicholas Edsall writes: [177]\n\n\nStonewall Day\nIn 2018, 49 years after the uprising, Stonewall Day was announced as a commemoration day by Pride Live, a social advocacy and community engagement organization [197] [198] The second Stonewall Day was held on Friday, June 28, 2019, outside the Stonewall Inn [199] During this event, Pride Live introduced their Stonewall Ambassadors program, to raise awareness for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots [200]\n\n\nHistoric landmark and monument\nIn June 1999, the US Department of the Interior included 51 and 53 Christopher Street and the surrounding area in Greenwich Village into the National Register of Historic Places, the first of significance to the LGBTQ community [201] [202] In a dedication ceremony,

[citation needed] Vivek graduated from The American College in Madurai [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly career (1987–1997)\nWhile working at the Secretariat in Chennai, Vivek in his free-time participated at the Madras Humour Club where people would perform stand-up comedy He helped pioneer the movement to expand and subsequently won the Best Entertainer Award several times during his pantomimes at the club Vivek subsequently left Chennai and went on to obtain a bachelor's degree in commerce from Madurai and during semester breaks, he would return and perform at the club [5] P R Govindarajan, Founder of Humour Club,  introduced him to film director K Balachandar for the first time and began a professional relationship as a script-writer for the director's films Vivek revealed that after four years, Balachandar explained a situation and asked him to write a script for sixteen characters, which Vivek completed overnight He later understood that this was actually a test, and through his performance, Balachandar became closer to Vivek [5] While assisting with the script for Manathil Uruthi Vendum in 1987, Balachandar offered Vivek an acting role of Suhasini's brother in the film, which he decided to pursue [6] He began his career portraying supporting roles and collaborated again with Balachandar in Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal (1989) and Oru Veedu Iru Vasal (1990), before often appearing in the primary cast as a friend to the film's lead actor in films such as K S Ravikumar's Putham Pudhu Payanam (1991) and Vikraman's Naan Pesa Ninaipathellam (1993) He then also made appearances in Rajinikanth's Uzhaippali and Veera, playing secondary cast roles Vivek had to wait till 1996 to establish himself as a sole comedian who could help carry the film, and thereafter began to appear in increasingly prominent roles in his ventures [7]\n\n\nBreakthrough and success (1998–2007)\nIn the late 1990s, Vivek was able to make a breakthrough by appearing as the lead comedian in films, who would often be the main friend of the lead actor and thus his on-screen time began to increase He worked consecutively on successful films starring Ajith Kumar, appearing as a sidekick in Kaadhal Mannan, Unnai Thedi and Vaali, and had similar success repeatedly featuring alongside Prashanth in Kannedhirey Thondrinal, Poomagal Oorvalam and Aasaiyil Oru Kaditham He subsequently became amongst the most busy actors in 2000 and 2001, featuring in over fifty films in two years Films including Kushi, Priyamanavale and Minnale became blockbusters, while his roles in Mani Ratnam's Alaipayuthey, Mugavaree and Dumm Dumm Dumm all won critical acclaim for the actor The rising success of Vivek's films had meant that he was featured on film posters on an equivalent scale to the lead actor, and thus helped stuck films find distributors Telugu films were dubbed into Tamil and released with an additional comedy track featuring the actor such as Kanden Seethaiyai, while devotional films Kottai Mariamman, Palayathu Amman and Nageswari were released with a separate comedy track featuring Vivek [8] [9] In 2000, director K Subash had planned a film starring Vivek in the leading role titled Enakkenna Korachal?, however the film never materialised [10] Similarly in 2001, he began production on a film titled Panju by Rama Narayanan in which he appeared as the protagonist, but the venture was also then shelved as was another film to be directed by Sivachandran [11] [12]\n\n\nLater work (2008–2025)\nIn the late 2000s, Vivek's market reach began to falter as a result of changes in screenplay in Tamil cinema, which saw fewer films adopting a separate comedy track Moreover, the lack of big budget films signed by the actor and the emergence of Santhanam, saw Vivek reach a nadir in 2012, where he only had a single release [26] His acclaimed work during the period involved a portrayal of a don in Padikathavan (2009), an appearance in drag in Guru En Aalu (2009) and as a police officer in the Singam (2010) series [27] Re-emerging after a sabbatical, Vivek announced his plans to move away from his usual comedy roles after being advised by director Bala and Kamal Haasan and signed for a film titled Naan Than Bala (2014), in which he played a serious role [28] Simultaneously he began work on another film as the lead actor in Palakkattu Madhavan (2015) opposite Sonia Agarwal, while appearing in another parallel lead role with Karunas in Sakthi Chidambaram's unreleased Machan After his return, Vivek collaborated with film makers to appear again in bigger budget films and worked on Velraj's Velaiyilla Pattathari (2014), Gautham Vasudev Menon's Yennai Arindhaal (2015), Aishwarya Dhanush's Vai Raja Vai (2015) [29]\n\n\nFilmography\nVivek married

experienced breathlessness and chest pain and was admitted to a SIMS Hospital in Chennai after falling unconscious at home Doctors deemed him critical and discovered that he had a thrombosis with 100% blockage in the left anterior descending artery, which caused congestive heart failure [44] [45] Following an angioplasty, he died in hospital on 17 April 2021 at the age of 59 [46] [47] He was given a state funeral amidst large crowds near his residence in Virugambakkam, Chennai [48] A day prior to the attack, Vivek received Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and campaigned for vaccination against COVID-19

{"title": "2024_Varzaqan_helicopter_crash", "content": "\nBackground\nThe helicopter involved was a Bell 212 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] with Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) registration number 6-9207 [5] Iran purchased the helicopter in the early 2000s [3] Former presidents Abolhassan Banisadr (served 1980–1981) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (served 2005–2013) were both involved in helicopter crashes during their terms in office, but survived [7]\n\n\nAccident\nOn 19 May, Raisi met President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev at the Giz Galasi hydroelectric complex along their countries' borders to inaugurate it and to commission the Khoda Afarin hydroelectric complex [9] [10] Following the meeting, Raisi, Amir-Abdollahian, Rahmati, Ale-Hashem, and Raisi's head of security, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Mohammad Mehdi Mousavi, departed for Tabriz by helicopter to inaugurate a project at an oil refinery [4] The helicopter was part of a convoy of three helicopters and was crewed by Iranian Air Force pilots Colonel Taher Mostafavi and Colonel Mohsen Daryanush and flight technician Major Behrouz Qadimi [4] [6] [a] A total of eight people were aboard the helicopter [3]\n\n\nRecovery\nNews of the crash was released at 16:00, [4] with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) and Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi describing it as a hard landing caused by bad weather and fog [20] [13] Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces, ordered all its branches to deploy their full resources for rescue operations [20] Heavy fog affected search-and-rescue operations in Varzaqan [22] Reports indicated that search-and-rescue teams were expected to reach the site of the crash by 20:00 [23] By 20:39, Iranian forces were near the site of the crash [24] Forty rescue teams from the Iranian Red Crescent Society, [20] along with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), were sent to the area of the crash [25]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces assumed responsibility for investigating the cause of the crash [47] Turkish Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloğlu, whose country includes Iran in its area of responsibility for emergency response, said they had not found a signal from the helicopter upon hearing news of its crash, which suggested that the aircraft either did not have its transponder turned on or did not have such a system [48] A preliminary report released by the Iranian military on 23 May found that the helicopter had \"caught fire after hitting an elevated area\" It also said it had not found evidence of foul play [49] On 1 September, the Supreme Board of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran concluded in its\nfinal report that the accident was primarily the result of poor challenging atmospheric and climatic weather conditions, including thick fog [50] [51]\n\n\nAftermath\nRaisi was the second president of Iran to have died in office, following Mohammad-Ali Rajai, who was killed in a bombing in 1981 [3] The presidential line of succession begins with Mohammad Mokhber, the first vice president On 20 May, the cabinet said that the government would continue to operate \"without the slightest disruption\" [38] That same day, Mokhber was formally designated as acting president by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, while Ali Bagheri was appointed as acting foreign minister [3] If power is transferred to the vice president in this way, Iranian law states that a new presidential election must be called within six months [52] Authorities subsequently set the election date for 28 June [53]\n\n\nFunerals\nThe Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance ordered the suspension of cultural events and venues as well as all activities relating to Cultural Heritage Week, which coincided with the mourning period, for seven days beginning 20 May [59] Government offices and private businesses were ordered to close 22 May to coincide with the funerals for the victims [48]\n\n\nReactions\nReactions among Iranians were mixed [74] Before the confirmation of Raisi's death, prayers for him were held in cities across the country, which were aired by state-run television [75] At the same time, videos of people in Iran setting off celebratory fireworks began circulating on social media, while others danced, played music, or honked car horns in solidarity with those celebrating [76] Images were posted to social media showing people killed and injured during the crackdown on the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests under Raisi's presidency [77] Police in Tehran warned that anyone who appeared publicly happy about Raisi's death would be prosecuted [76]\n\n\nDomestic\nReactions among

that occurred on 19 May 2024, near Varzaqan, Iran, resulting in the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, eight others, and several injuries.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe helicopter involved in the crash was a Bell 212 with Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) registration number 6-9207. Iran purchased the helicopter in the early 2000s. The Bell 212 is a twin-engine, medium-lift helicopter that has been used by various military and civilian organizations around the world.\n\nFormer presidents Abolhassan Banisadr (served 1980–1981) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (served 2005–2013) were both involved in helicopter crashes during their terms in office, but survived.\n\n**Accident**\n\nOn 19 May, Raisi met President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev at the Giz Galasi hydroelectric complex along their countries' borders to inaugurate it and to commission the Khoda Afarin hydroelectric complex. Following the meeting, Raisi, Amir-Abdollahian, Rahmati, Ale-Hashem, and Raisi's head of security, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Brigadier General Mohammad Mehdi Mousavi, departed for Tabriz by helicopter to inaugurate a project at an oil refinery. The helicopter was part of a convoy of three helicopters and was crewed by Iranian Air Force pilots Colonel Taher Mostafavi and Colonel Mohsen Daryanush and flight technician Major Behrouz Qadimi. A total of eight people were aboard the helicopter.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nNews of the crash was released at 16:00, with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) and Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi describing it as a hard landing caused by bad weather and fog. Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces, ordered all its branches to deploy their full resources for rescue operations. Heavy fog affected search-and-rescue operations in Varzaqan. Reports indicated that search-and-rescue teams were expected to reach the site of the crash by 20:00. By 20:39, Iranian forces were near the site of the crash. Forty rescue teams from the Iranian Red Crescent Society, along with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), were sent to the area of the crash.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces assumed responsibility for investigating the cause of the crash. A preliminary report released by the Iranian military on 23 May found that the helicopter had \"caught fire after hitting an elevated area.\" It also said it had not found evidence of foul play. On 1 September, the Supreme Board of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran concluded in its final report that the accident was primarily the result of poor challenging atmospheric and climatic weather conditions, including thick fog.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nRaisi was the second president of Iran to have died in office, following Mohammad-Ali Rajai, who was killed in a bombing in 1981. The presidential line of succession begins with Mohammad Mokhber, the first vice president. On 20 May, the cabinet said that the government would continue to operate \"without the slightest disruption.\" That same day, Mokhber was formally designated as acting president by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, while Ali Bagheri was appointed as acting foreign minister. If power is transferred to the vice president in this way, Iranian law states that a new presidential election must be called within six months. Authorities subsequently set the election date for 28 June.\n\n**Funerals**\n\nThe Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance ordered the suspension of cultural events and venues as well as all activities relating to Cultural Heritage Week, which coincided with the mourning period, for seven days beginning 20 May. Government offices and private businesses were ordered to close 22 May to coincide with the funerals for the victims.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nReactions among Iranians were mixed. Before the confirmation of Raisi's death, prayers for him were held in cities across the country, which were aired by state-run television. At the same time, videos of people in Iran setting off celebratory fireworks began circulating on social media, while others danced, played music, or honked car horns in solidarity with those celebrating. Images were posted to social media showing people killed and injured during the crackdown on the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests under Raisi's presidency. Police in Tehran warned that anyone who appeared publicly happy about Raisi's death would be prosecuted.\n\n**Domestic**\n\nReactions among Iranians were mixed.

and Mary Sanderson as well, but stressed that Disney had yet to greenlight any sequel, encouraging fans of the original film to persuade Disney to make one [10] In November 2015, Midler stated in a Facebook Q&A that \"after all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no\" in response to a question about a sequel [11]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn July 2014, it was announced that The Walt Disney Company was developing a supernatural-themed film about witches, and that Tina Fey was on board as a producer and star However, Deadline Hollywood debunked rumors that the film was a sequel to Hocus Pocus [9] In November 2014, Bette Midler said in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" that she was ready and willing to return for a sequel as Winifred Sanderson She

stand and firmly say an unequivocal no\" in response to a question about a sequel [11]\n\n\nCasting\nOn November 1, 2019, Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy expressed interest in reprising their roles as the Sanderson sisters in the sequel [23] In September 2020, Midler revealed that she has entered talks to return in the film as Winifred, [24] and in October 2020, she said she would return alongside Parker and Najimy, [25] though their returns were not officially confirmed until May 2021 [26] In October 2021, it was announced that Taylor Paige Henderson had been cast as one of the three leads [27] Shortly afterwards, Sam Richardson was reported to be in final negotiations to join the cast in an undisclosed role [28] That same month, Tony Hale joined the cast as the mayor of Salem, Jefry Traske, and the full supporting cast was confirmed on October 31, 2021, including Hannah Waddingham and the return of Doug Jones, who portrayed William \"Billy\" Butcherson in the original film [5] [29] In March 2022, it was announced that Thora Birch would not be reprising the role of Dani Dennison from the previous film [30] Birch later revealed she would have appeared in the film but was unable to due to a scheduling conflict [31] In the summer of that year, it was then announced that Sean Murray, Larry Bagby, Tobias Jelinek, Omri Katz, and Vinessa Shaw would also not be reprising their roles as Thackery Binx, Ice, Jay, Max, and Allison, respectively [32] [33] [34] In March 2023, during a Hocus Pocus reunion at the 2023 90's Con in Hartford, Connecticut, Birch, Shaw, Marsden, and Katz revealed that they were never contacted or considered for the sequel, and revealed there was a possibility for working their characters into the script before Disney decided to go in a different route for the sequel [35]\n\n\nPre-production\nOn October 29, 2020, Midler stated that a story outline for the sequel has been completed, which she praised as \"pretty great\" along with Najimy and Parker [36] On November 3, Midler revealed that the producers were trying to re-hire several members of the first film's production team that are alive and had not retired, as they felt much of the success of the first film came from the work of the behind-the-scenes team [37] In April 2021, Anne Fletcher replaced Shankman as the director due to his directing duties with Disenchanted, although he did remain as an executive producer on the film [38]\n\n\nFilming\nProduction was scheduled to begin in the middle of 2021, in Salem, Massachusetts [39] In September 2021, sets for Hocus Pocus 2 were confirmed being built at Chase Farms in Lincoln, Rhode Island, [40] and Washington Square in Newport, Rhode Island  Filming began on October 18, 2021, in Providence, Rhode Island, under the working title Black Flame [41] [42] All scenes Samuel Skelton High School was shot in the Moses Brown School (exteriors)  and in the La Salle Academy (interior) [43]\n\n\nMusic\nIn October 2021, it was announced that John Debney, the composer of the original film, was set to return to score the sequel [48] The soundtrack, which features two new songs in addition to Debney's score, was released digitally by Walt Disney Records on September 30, 2022, and was released physically on November 11, 2022 [49]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first teaser trailer was released on June 28, 2022 [50] The teaser trailer reached 43.6 million views in its first 24 hours while on Twitter, the #HocusPocus became a top trend of the day on Twitter following the teaser's debut The social media conversation was also the most gender balanced of the comps at 51 percent male and 49 percent female [51] On August 29, 2022, a first look at Doug Jones as Billy was released showing the character resurrected again by the Sanderson sisters [52] On September 9, 2022, the official trailer for the film premiered at the 2022 D23 Expo and was released online afterward [53] On September 21, 2022, the first look at RuPaul's Drag Race trio as the Sanderson Sisters plus a new brand poster were released [54] [55] After the release of the film, in October, 2022, the Sanderson Sisters and other material based on the film were included in the video game Disney Magic Kingdoms for a Halloween Event focused in Hocus Pocus 2,  although with the characters involved in a new storyline unrelated to the events of the film [56]\n\n\nRelease\nHocus Pocus 2 was released on September 30, 2022, on Disney+ [57] [4]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to market research company Parrot Analytics, which looks at

{"title": "2021_Pacific_typhoon_season", "content": "\nSeasonal forecasts\nDuring the year, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of University College London, PAGASA and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau The first forecast was released by PAGASA on December 27, 2020, in their monthly seasonal climate outlook predicting the first half of 2021 [6] The PAGASA predicts that only 0–3 tropical cyclones are expected to form or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between January and March, while 1–4 tropical cyclones are expected to form between April and June PAGASA also predicted that the ongoing La Niña could persist until the end of the first quarter of 2021 [6] Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) issued their first extended range forecast on May 11, predicting a slightly below-average season with 24 tropical storms, 15 typhoons and 9 intense typhoons [3]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nThe season began in January with a weak and short-lived tropical depression that brought damages to the Philippines In mid-February, another tropical depression formed, before being assigned the local name Auring by the PAGASA The system then strengthened into a tropical storm, being given the name Dujuan by the JMA, making it the first named storm of the year Another tropical depression formed in March, though it was short-lived, dissipating shortly after forming On April 12, a tropical depression formed to the south of Woleai It strengthened into a tropical storm, being given the name Surigae by the JMA On April 15, it was further upgraded into a severe tropical storm, before being upgraded to a typhoon on the next day, and to a super typhoon on April 17, [nb 1] making it the first of the season and the strongest recorded cyclone to form in the month of April in the Northern Hemisphere, however, it did not hit any landmasses Then, in mid-May a new tropical depression was named Crising by the PAGASA and made landfall on Baganga, Davao Oriental as a weak tropical storm, bringing minimal damages due to its small size Two tropical depressions formed on May 29 and 30 respectively, with the first being assigned the local name Dante by the PAGASA Dante intensified into a tropical storm, being assigned the name Choi-wan, before moving over the Philippines and making landfall eight times, bringing widespread damages to the country A tropical depression formed behind Choi-wan on May 30; it didn't develop further.\n\n\nSystems\nAt 06:00 UTC on February 16, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had formed [10] Eight hours later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system [11] By February 17, the system moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), and was assigned the local name Auring from the PAGASA [12] At 06:00 UTC on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 01W The system was later named Dujuan as the first named storm of 2021 The PAGASA later upgraded Dujuan to a severe tropical storm; however, this only lasted for six hours [13] [14] On February 20, the storm significantly weakened into a tropical depression due to high vertical wind shear Both JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories moments after [15] The storm made landfall over Batag Island in Laoang, Northern Samar at 09:00 PHT (01:00 UTC) on February 22, [16] dissipating thereafter.\n\n\nTropical Storm Dujuan (Auring)\nAt 06:00 UTC on February 16, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had formed [10] Eight hours later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system [11] By February 17, the system moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), and was assigned the local name Auring from the PAGASA [12] At 06:00 UTC on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 01W The system was later named Dujuan as the first named storm of 2021 The PAGASA later upgraded Dujuan to a severe tropical storm; however, this only lasted for six hours [13] [14] On February 20, the storm significantly weakened into a tropical depression due to high vertical wind shear Both JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories moments after [15] The storm made landfall over Batag Island in Laoang, Northern Samar at 09:00 PHT (01:00 UTC) on February 22, [16] dissipating thereafter.\n\n\nTyphoon Surigae (Bising)\nA low-pressure area south of Woleai developed into a tropical depression on April 12 [22] [23] A few hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the developing storm, with the PAGASA beginning to issue advisories for the tropical depression as it remained outside of the PAR [24] [25] On April 13, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and assigned it the designation 02W [26] At 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm and named it Surigae [27] On April 15 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Surigae to a severe tropical storm as an eye began forming [28] Later that day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a typhoon, making it the first of the season Surigae then entered the PAGASA's Philippine Area of Responsibility, getting the local name Bising Surigae continued to rapidly intensify until it reached Category 5-equivalent super typhoon status, becoming the most intense typhoon ever recorded in the month of April [29] [30] [31] Surigae soon reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 895 millibars (26.43 inHg), 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph), and 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h (195 mph) [32] [33] A few days later, on April 22, Surigae began to weaken again, with the storm's structure deteriorating and its large eye dissipating [34] Soon afterward, all of the remaining convection was sheared to the east as the storm moved over cooler waters [35] Late on April 24, JTWC and JMA declared and issued their final advisory that Surigae had become extratropical [36]\n\n\nTropical Depression 03W (Crising)\nOn May 11, the JTWC noted a persistent area of convection in the Philippine Sea, approximately 184 nmi (341 km) west of Palau [41] The JTWC issued a TCFA for the convection on May 12, as it further developed in an environment with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures [42] Just three hours later, the agency recognized that the area of convection had quickly consolidated into a tropical depression and assigned it with the identifier of 03W [43] Around the same time, the JMA had also recognized the storm as a tropical depression while it was to the east of Mindanao [44] Since the storm developed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA immediately named the storm Crising once the agency recognized it as a tropical depression as well, and later raised Signal No 2 warnings for areas in Mindanao [45] [46] In the early hours of May 13, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm, with the PAGASA following suit hours later [47] [48] Later that day, Crising's low-level circulation center became exposed due to wind shear, and it lost organization At 8:20 p.m Philippine Standard Time (12:20 UTC), Crising made landfall in Baganga, Davao Oriental as a weakening tropical storm It quickly degraded as soon as it made landfall, with both the JTWC and the PAGASA downgrading it to a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC [49] [50] At 03:00 UTC on that day, the PAGASA reported that the system degenerated to an area of low-pressure in the vicinity of Piagapo in Lanao del Sur, thus lifting all warning signals on Mindanao and issuing their final advisory [51] On May 14, the system dissipated over the Sulu Sea, and both the JMA and the JTWC issued their final advisories on the storm.\n\n\nTropical Storm Choi-wan (Dante)\nOn May 27, the JMA and the JTWC noted the persistence of an area of atmospheric convection about 425 nautical miles (787 km; 489 mi) south-southeast of Guam [57] The area's nearby environment exhibited low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, which were ideal conditions for tropical cyclogenesis [58] The JMA assessed the area to have developed into a tropical depression on May 29 at 06:00 UTC [59] The PAGASA made a similar assessment in a Tropical Cyclone Advisory issued at 15:00 UTC [60] The JTWC later followed with their own assessment, identifying the center of the newly developed tropical depression and assigning the designation 04W [61] As the system tracked westward, it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility at 01:00 PHT (17:00 UTC) [62] The PAGASA then named the storm Dante in its first Tropical Cyclone Bulletin for the storm [63] Dante further organized in the Philippine Sea, [64] and on May 30 at 15:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, [65] with the PAGASA doing the same at 21:00 UTC [66] On the next day at 00:00 UTC, the JMA also upgraded Dante into a tropical storm, giving it the international name Choi-wan [67] Choi-wan's center was exposed due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough from the northeast, inducing shear on the system [68] On June 1 at 12:30 UTC, Choi-wan made landfall on Sulat, Eastern Samar as a minimal tropical storm, [69] with the JTWC downgrading it to a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC [70] It made a second landfall on Cataingan at 17:00 UTC [71] Choi-wan made several more landfalls on the Philippines, making its third landfall on Balud, Masbate at 19:30 UTC It made a fourth landfall on Romblon, Romblon on June 2 at 00:00 UTC, a fifth on San Agustin, Romblon at 00:50 UTC, a sixth on Pola, Oriental Mindoro at 06:00 UTC, a seventh on Tingloy, Batangas at 11:20 UTC, and an eighth and final landfall on the Calatagan Peninsula before moving into the South China Sea [72] On June 3 at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Choi-wan back to a tropical storm [73] At 03:00 UTC, the PAGASA removed all Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals as Choi-wan moved away from the country [74] Choi-wan then exited the PAR on June 3 at 18:00 UTC [75] before weakening into a tropical depression on the next day at 06:00 UTC and re-entering the PAR at 08:00 UTC [76] Then, it passed southeast of the island of Taiwan [77] before moving out near the Okinawa Prefecture and heading towards Japan [citation needed] On June 5 at 06:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued their final advisory on the system [78] 3 hours later at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Choi-wan back into a tropical storm, [79] however at 15:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded the system to a tropical depression, also issuing their final advisory on the system [80]\n\n\nTropical Storm Koguma\nOn June 10, the JTWC started to monitor an area of low-pressure in the South China Sea, approximately 518 km (322 mi) to the south of Hong Kong, with the agency classifying the system as a monsoon depression [85] Tracking west-northwestward, the storm was located in a favorable environment for further development, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear [86] At 00:00 UTC on June 11, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical depression [87] Six hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as it began to show characteristics of a monsoon depression [88] By 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Koguma [87] On June 12 at 00:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Koguma to a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 05W [89] Later that day, the JTWC also upgraded Koguma to a tropical storm [89] By June 12, it had made landfall southeast of Hanoi, [90] and dissipated the next day [87]\n\n\nTyphoon Champi\nAt 00:00 UTC on June 18, the JTWC started to monitor a broad area of convection nearly 250 km (160 mi) to the south-southwest of Pohnpei [92] The system remained weak as it moved northwestwards in a favorable environment for further intensification, characterized by warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate wind shear and good outflow; the disturbance remained weak as it moved northwestwards [92] [93] The JTWC issued a TCFA on the system two days later, though the system remained disorganized [94] [95] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on June 21 [96] Meanwhile, the JTWC designated it as 06W in their first advisory on the system, with an exposed LLCC being evident on satellite imagery due to moderate wind shear, being induced by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its north [97] [98] By 21:00 on June 21, 06W made its closest passage to the south-southwest of Guam, continuing its northwest track [99] [100] On June 22, at 06:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm as it continued to move away from Guam [101] The JMA followed and upgraded the system into a tropical storm, in June 23 at 00:00 UTC, and assigned it the name Champi [102] At 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as it turned northwestwards [103] At this time, a microwave imagery scan of Champi revealed an eye feature emerging in the system; however, this was short lived as dry air continued to impact the storm from the west [104] In addition, poleward outflow on the system remained weak on June 24, restricting Champi to significantly develop [105] However, on the next day, as a shortwave trough crossed the Ryukyu Islands, the outflow increased on the storm which allowed it to intensify further [106] On June 25, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA officially declared the storm a typhoon [107] The JTWC soon followed, upgrading it into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon [108] At this time, a Champi turned north and north-northwestwards, and subsequently reached its peak intensity of 120 km/h (75 mph) ten-minute maximum sustained winds with a minimum barometric pressure of 980 hPa (28.94 inHg) by 21:00 UTC on June 25, however it was downgraded to a tropical storm a day later [109] The storm continued to weaken as it move towards the Japanese islands, until on June 27, the JMA issued its last advisory at 12:00 UTC as the system became an extratropical low [110] The JTWC also issued its last warning for Champi at 09:00 UTC, same day [111]\n\n\nTropical Depression 07W (Emong)\nOn July 2, the JTWC started to monitor a tropical disturbance to the southwest of Guam [118] Moving northwestwards, the disturbance was located in an environment conducive for intensification in the Philippine Sea, with warm sea surface temperatures, and low wind shear, in addition to good poleward outflow, being induced by an upper-level trough to the northwest [119] [120] The JMA upgraded the broad and weak system to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on the next day, [121] followed by a TCFA being issued by the JTWC an hour and a half later [122] [123] The PAGASA subsequently upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 02:00 UTC on July 4, naming it Emong [124] [125] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression, designating it as 07W [126] On July 6, PAGASA issued its last advisory on Tropical Depression Emong at 03:00 UTC as it moved outside the PAR and also lift up the warnings which were imposed earlier in the wake of Emong [127] Meanwhile, the JMA soon followed and issued its last advisory [128] JTWC also issued its last advisory as its convection was significantly sheared and its low level circulation dissipated rapidly over six hours [129] [130]\n\n\nTropical Depression 08W\nAt 12:00 UTC on July 3, the PAGASA started to monitor a low-pressure area that developed near Torrijos, Marinduque or 149 kilometers to the south of Manila, followed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)'s advisory at 01:00 UTC on the next day, citing the system's development as \"low\" [134] [135] In the latter's analysis on the disturbance, multispectral and microwave image scans on the system showed a weak low-level circulation center over the eastern part of Mindoro with flaring convection in the western periphery [135] Traveling northwestwards, the storm was located in an environment conductive for further intensification, with warm sea surface temperatures of 30–31 °C (86–88 °F), low wind shear around the region and good equatorial outflow; however, model forecasts were split regarding the disturbance's strengthening trend [135] [136] Also that day at 15:00 UTC, the low-pressure area exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), which was followed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgrading the storm to a tropical depression roughly three hours later [137] [138] Eventually, the JTWC upgraded the system's potential intensification trend to \"high\" and subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 00:30 UTC on June 6 as a circulation became well-defined [139] It then changed its motion towards the west along the periphery of a subtropical ridge on the north and northwest as it approached the Hainan Island [140] By 06:00 UTC on the next day, the disturbance moved inland on the region near Lingshui Li Autonomous County before emerging on the Gulf of Tonkin, in an area of low to moderate wind shear [141] [142] [143] Later, the disturbance began to reorganize; however, strong wind gradient suppressed its intensification, with flaring convection displaced to the west [142] Nine hours later, the JTWC upgraded the system to a weak tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 45 km/h (30 mph); the JMA analysed the storm to be at 55 km/h (35 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000 hPa (29.53 inHg) [144] [145] [146] By the night of that day, the depression, with the identifier 08W from the JTWC made landfall on Thanh Hoa, Vietnam on that intensity, before subsequently issuing their final warning as the agency confirmed that the system dissipated inland, with the evidences of radar and satellite imagery [147] The JMA continued to monitor the system until it dissipated at 00:00 UTC on July 8 over Laos [148]\n\n\nTyphoon In-fa (Fabian)\nAt 06:00 UTC on July 14, the JTWC started to monitor an area of low pressure west-northwest of Guam [161] Located in an area favorable for intensification with warm sea surface temperatures as its outflow improved, the system struggled to develop under moderate wind shear before gradually intensifying, with the agency issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 20:30 UTC on the next day [161] [162] [163] [164] On July 16, the PAGASA upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, assigning it the local name Fabian [165] The JMA later recognized the system as a tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on the same day, [166] with the JTWC doing the same at 09:00 UTC, designating it as 09W [167] On July 18 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm assigning it the name In-fa [168] The JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical storm at 03:00 UTC The system had deep flaring convection, however its low-level circulation was broad and elongated [169] On July 18, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm [170] [171] In-fa started moving westwards, [172] and as it gradually strengthened, In-fa developed a formative eye on July 20, at 03:00 UTC [173] At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC declared In-fa to have strengthened into a typhoon as it had deep convection and robust outflow [174] [175] The JMA also followed suit and upgraded In-fa to a typhoon at 12:00 UTC because of good upper-level outflow and higher sea surface temperatures; however, its central dense overcast was still obscure [176] [177] On the next day at 03:00 UTC, In-fa strengthened into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon as its central convection continued to deepen The feeder bands became more compact and the eye of the typhoon became clearer and more defined [178] The JTWC assessed that it peaked as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon with maximum wind speeds of 175 km/h (110 mph) at 03:00 UTC the same day [179] Because of dry air, [citation needed] the JTWC later downgraded In-fa to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon at 03:00 UTC the next day despite the presence of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear [180] On July 23 at 21:00 UTC, In-fa got further downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC, as its eyewall became fragmented and the deep convection was not continuous over the eye; [181] it later re-intensified into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon again at 03:00 UTC the next day as it regained convective depths and it managed to maintain a ragged eye [182] At 09:00 UTC, PAGASA issued its final advisory as Typhoon In-fa moved northwards and exited the PAR [183] On July 24, at 06:00 UTC, In-fa peaked as a typhoon with maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a minimum pressure of 950 hPa (28.05 inHg), according to the JMA [184] On the next day, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) noted In-fa to have made landfall in Putuo Island at around 04:30 UTC [185] After making landfall, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm at 09:00 UTC as it eye structure began to degrade [186] JMA later downgraded to a severe tropical storm at 12:00 UTC, because of influence of land and involvement of dry air [187]\n\n\nTyphoon Cempaka\nOn July 17, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had formed [188] [189] The JTWC later issued a TCFA for the system, as the aforementioned area of convection became more organized [190] By the following day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and designated it as 10W, with the storm possessing an improved convective structure and a defined low-level circulation [191] [192] The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 21:00 UTC as it had a defined low-level circulation center with improved banding structure [193] At 00:00 UTC on July 19, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Cempaka [194] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC declared Cempaka to have strengthened into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon as it developed a ragged 15 nmi (28 km; 17 mi) wide eye [195] [196] The JMA later upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on the next day [197] On July 20, at 06:00 UTC, Cempaka peaked as a severe tropical storm with 10-sustained maximum wind speed of 55 kn (100 km/h; 65 mph) with minimum pressure of 990 hPa (29.23 inHg), according to JMA [198] JTWC assessed that it peaked as a typhoon with maximum 1-minute sustained wind of 80 kn (150 km/h; 90 mph) [199] Cempaka made landfall near Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang, Guangdong Province, [200] and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC the same day as its low-level circulation center became obscure [201] The JMA also downgraded Cempaka to a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC the next day as it moved further inland and its central dense overcast disappeared [202] [203] At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC further downgraded Cempaka to a tropical depression as its deep convection declined; however, it still retained a well-defined wind field [204] After moving inland, Cempaka started moving westward at 00:00 UTC on July 21 due to weak steering flow [205] Remaining inland, Cempaka maintained tropical storm intensity as it continued westward, but due to unfavorable conditions over land, it weakened into a tropical depression on the next day at 00:00 UTC [206] On July 22, at 09:00 UTC, Cempaka then moved southwards towards the Gulf of Tonkin because of the influence of the monsoonal westerlies, while maintaining its tropical depression intensity inland [207] Cempaka moved southward, crossed Móng Cái, Quảng Ninh Province in Vietnam and later entered the Gulf of Tonkin at 03:00 UTC [208] However, Cempaka further weakened despite the presence of warm sea surface temperatures because of high monsoonal wind shear and land interaction [209] [210] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system as it became a weakly defined system with an exposed low-level circulation center over Bạch Long Vĩ Island [211] On July 26 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its last advisory [212]\n\n\nTropical Storm Nepartak\nAt 06:00 UTC on July 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance with subtropical features along the eastern portion of a monsoon trough, located approximately 466 nmi (865 km; 535 mi) to the north of Guam A weak system, multispectral satellite imageries revealed that the disturbance was disorganized along the said trough, while advanced scaterrometer data showed the same feature with southerly convergent flow over the northern Mariana Islands Environmental analysis depicted an unfavorable amount of wind shear, although the agency noted that the disturbance could form as a subtropical cyclone along the subtropical trough with the help of baroclinity [220] Tracking northeastward, the system slowly organized, with a low-level circulation center developing seen on meteorological satellite imageries The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the disturbance as a tropical depression, seventeen hours later while the JTWC upgraded the system's potential intensification trend from \"medium\" to \"high\" and subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the storm at 22:30 UTC that day [221] [222] [223] At 12:00 UTC, Dvorak intensity observations and surface wind data from satellite scatterometer confirmed that the depression further intensified to the eighth tropical storm of the season, whereupon the JMA named it as Nepartak [224] The JTWC, however only issued its first warning on Nepartak as Tropical Depression 11W, three hours later as its LLCC further became broad and exposed with its center remaining weakly defined while being steered on the continued direction by a north–south oriented subtropical ridge [225] [226] Nine hours later, the agency further upgraded the system to a subtropical storm as vigorous deep convection further became constant on the east of the still-exposed and elongated circulation center [227] [228] By July 24, Nepartak was guided north-northeastwards by an upper-level low and a trough Baroclinic interaction with the latter also led to the development of a large and asymmetric wind field, with the maximum sustained winds of 35 kn (40 mph; 65 km/h) being far from the center [228] [229] Later, the system's core became ragged as it turned northwards and further northeast before shifting north again while remaining at that intensity At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC noted two distinct vorticities, being spaced 350 nmi (650 km; 405 mi) to each other, with each having an elongated circulation from the south-southwest to the north-northeast [230] [231]\n\n\nTropical Depression 12W\nOn August 1, the JTWC issued a TCFA for a disturbance in the open western Pacific as it had an ill-defined low-level circulation center and deep convection [243] On the next day, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA recognized it as a tropical depression as it was located near Minami-Tori-shima It was moving northwards at 10 kn (19 km/h; 12 mph) [244] A few hours later, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 12W At that time, the LLC of the storm remained exposed and its strongest convection or thunderstorms were displaced to the west [245] A deep-layered subtropical ridge to the east guided the depression to move to the north-northwest while being near from a monsoon gyre [245] Despite being located in a favorable environment for additional strengthening, another system to the south slowly interacted with the depression, which weakened the storm's intensity It reached its peak intensity that day, with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) in the estimates of the JMA and the JTWC [246] [247] By August 3, the JTWC downgraded 12W to a disturbance as its structure deteriorated; [248] the agency upgraded it back to a tropical depression a day later [249] The system's LLC then became fully exposed, [250] and on August 6, both the JTWC and the JMA assessed that 12W had dissipated [249] [251]\n\n\nTropical Storm Lupit (Huaning)\nOn August 2, the JMA noted a tropical depression near Zhanjiang had formed [252] Soon afterwards, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the disturbance situated approximately 153 nm west-southwest of Hong Kong [253] On the same day at 21:00 UTC, the JTWC assessed the system as a tropical depression and accordingly designated it as 13W [254] Twenty-four hours later, the agency upgraded the system to a tropical storm [255] On August 4 at 12:00 UTC, the JMA followed suit and designated the system as a tropical storm, assigning it the name Lupit [256] A day later at 03:20 UTC, it made landfall over Nan'ao County in Shantou, Guangdong Province [citation needed] At 08:50 UTC, it made another landfall over Dongshan County in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province [257] On August 7, it headed eastward and briefly entered the PAR, and was named Huaning by PAGASA [258] On August 8, at 18:00 UTC, Lupit peaked as a tropical storm with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 45 kn (85 km/h; 50 mph) and minimum pressure of 985 mb (29.09 inHg) [259] Maximum 1-minute sustained speed of Lupit was 45 kn (85 km/h; 50 mph) [260] On August 9, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its final warning, as it completed its extratropical transition [261] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC followed and issued its final warning [262]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Mirinae (Gorio)\nOn August 3, at 18:00 UTC, the JMA issued a tropical cyclone advisory for a tropical depression which was located off the east coast of Taiwan and north of the Philippines [267] The JMA later issued its first prognostic reasoning at the same time, stating that clusters of convective bursts were scattered around the low-level circulation [268] At 22:00 UTC, the same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, as it had a consolidating low-level circulation, and it was located in a very conductive environment with high sea surface temperatures and low to moderate vertical wind shear [269] On the next day, at 03:00 UTC, the PAGASA recognized it as a tropical depression and named it Gorio, as it was located inside the PAR [270] At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC did the same and designated it as 14W, as satellite imagery showed a fully exposed mesovortex [271] [272] On August 5, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, naming it as Mirinae Clusters of convective bursts were gathering around the center with a curved manner, with Mirinae having distinct anticyclonic outflow [273] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC followed and upgraded it to a tropical storm, as the storm developed a partially exposed low-level circulation center Flaring convection was present, though it was affected by moderate westerly wind shear [274] [275] On August 7, at 18:00 UTC, Mirinae peaked as a tropical storm with maximum 10-sustained wind speed of 50 kn (95 km/h; 60 mph) and minimum barometric pressure of 980 mb (28.94 inHg) [276] Maximum 1-minute sustained wind speed of Mirinae was 55 kn (100 km/h; 65 mph) [277] On August 9, at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final warning for the system [278] The JMA later issued its last warning on the next day at 00:00 UTC, as it became an extratropical cyclone [279]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Nida\nOn August 3, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA noted a tropical depression north of the Mariana Islands which was moving northwards at 10 kn (19 km/h; 12 mph) [280] At 03:00 UTC, the next day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system By that time, it had developed a partially obscured low-level circulation center [281] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC recognized it as a tropical depression, designating it as 15W [282] On August 5, 03:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as its low-level circulation center became more defined [283] [284] Three hours later, the JMA followed and named it Nida Satellite imagery showed that convective bursts were organized into a curved band and that the system was exhibiting good anticyclone outflow [285] On August 6, at 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, as it had distinct anticyclonic outflow [286] Nida then started moving eastwards at 6:00 UTC the next day, because of a mid-level subtropical high-pressure area along with the westerlies [287] On August 7, at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC issued the last advisory for the system, as its low-level circulation center was partly exposed due to the westerlies inflicting shear upon the storm [288] However, the JMA continued to publish bulletins for the system Nida continued its trajectory On August 7, 12:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm due to shear and a generally less conductive environment [289] The JMA further downgraded it to an extratropical low at 00:00 UTC the next day as it completed its extratropical transition [290]\n\n\nTropical Storm Omais (Isang)\nOn August 6, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) first noted an area of disturbed weather positioned around 1,000 mi (1,610 km) south-southwest of Honolulu [291] Four days later, the low-pressure area crossed the International Date Line, and on August 10, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA declared it as a tropical depression as it was located northeast of Ratak [292] [293] By 13:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as satellite imagery showed it had developed a well-defined low-level circulation [294] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC recognized it as a tropical depression and designated it as 16W as satellite imagery depicted developing spiral bands and a defined low-level circulation center [295] [296] The system briefly became a tropical storm; [297] However, at 21:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression [298] as its convection struggled to organize itself [299] It regained its intensity at 09:00 UTC the next day [300] as its convection became more organized Satellite imagery also continued to indicate the presence of a well-defined low-level circulation center [301] It was downgraded to a tropical depression again on the next day [302] as its low-level circulation center became less defined [303] On August 16, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its final advisory for the system, losing its tropical cyclone characteristics because of unfavorable conditions [304] Later at 00:00 UTC, the next day, the JMA started tracking the system again [305] At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as the system's convection became further disorganized despite the presence of a marginally favorable environment [306] At 19:30 UTC on August 18, the JTWC issued a TCFA for its remnants as its low-level circulation center improved significantly [307] On August 19, the system was upgraded by PAGASA to a tropical depression, and a few hours later, it received the local name Isang as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility [308] At 15:00 UTC, the system was re-upgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC, [309] as its deep convection started to become more organized over the low-level center [310] On August 20, at 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded to a tropical storm, naming it as Omais Favorable conditions like high sea-surface temperatures, high tropical cyclone heat potential, and low wind shear helped it to develop over the past few hours [311] The JTWC did the same thing at 21:00 UTC, the same day [312] At 18:00 UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm as satellite imagery showed convective bursts gathering around the center in a curved manner; [313] however, shortly after at 06:00 UTC on August 22, it weakened into a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear from the westerlies [314] At 03:00 UTC on August 23, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression [315] as its convection was severely affected by the extremely high westerly wind shear [316] On August 24 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its final advisory as the system became an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan [317] Nine hours later, the JTWC followed and issued its last warning for Omais [318]\n\n\nTropical Depression 17W\nOn September 1 on 00:00 UTC, the JMA noticed a tropical depression near Wake Island [322] At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC gave a medium chance of formation for the system over the same area, despite being classified as subtropical depression, as it developed a well defined, partially exposed low-level circulation center [323] At 20:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, [324] and at 03:00 UTC the next day, it was upgraded to a tropical depression and was designated as 17W, [325] as its low-level circulation center became more defined but still partially exposed [326] The system maintained its defined convective structure, [327] [328] [329] [330] however at 09:00 UTC on September 3, it struggled to consolidate because of presence of dry air causing its convective structure to diminish [331] [332] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as its remaining convection was sheared by the incoming westerlies [333] At 12:00 UTC on September 4, the JMA stopped tracking the system [334]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Conson (Jolina)\nOn September 3, a disturbance was noted by the JTWC, approximately 195 nmi (225 mi; 360 km) from Andersen Air Force Base in Yigo, Guam, as it developed a weakly defined low-level circulation center [335] The disturbance gradually intensified, and on September 5, the JMA recognized the system as a tropical depression [336] Later that day, the JTWC issued a TCFA as its low-level circulation center and its surrounding convection became well organized [337] The agency recognized the system as a tropical depression around four hours later [338] At 21:00 UTC, the PAGASA recognized the system as a tropical depression, with the agency assigning it the local name Jolina [339] The next day on 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the international name Conson, with the JTWC following suit three hours later [340] [341] At 12:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it typhoon before downgrading it into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC [342] Three hours later, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [343] At the same moment, Conson rapidly intensified into a typhoon according to the PAGASA as it made its first landfall on Hernani, Eastern Samar [344] Conson then made another landfall at 02:30 PHT (18:30 UTC) in Daram, Samar, and another one at 03:40 PHT (19:40 UTC) in Santo Niño, Samar [345] At 06:30 PHT (22:30 UTC), Conson made a fourth landfall in Almagro, Samar At 00:00 UTC on September 7, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm as it was significantly weakened by multiple landfalls [346] Conson then made a fifth landfall in Dimasalang, Masbate at 11:00 PHT (03:00 UTC), later weakening into a severe tropical storm, according to PAGASA [347] [348] Conson then made a sixth landfall over Torrijos, Marinduque [349] Conson continued to pummel through more islands, making a seventh landfall over the area in Lobo, Batangas [350] After making its eighth landfall at San Juan, Batangas, Conson traversed the Batangas – Cavite area as the PAGASA declared it to have weakened back into a tropical storm [351] Conson made its ninth and final landfall in the vicinity of Mariveles, Bataan [352] At 12:00 UTC, Conson re-intensified into a severe tropical storm, as it entered the West Philippine Sea [353] Three hours later, the PAGASA issued its final bulletin for Conson as it exited the PAR and accelerated westward [354]\n\n\nTyphoon Chanthu (Kiko)\nAt 06:00 UTC on September 5, the JTWC began monitoring an area of convection that had formed 446 nmi (513 mi; 826 km) from Legazpi, Philippines [367] At 18:00 UTC the same day, the JMA declared it as a tropical depression [368] Five and half hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA as its circulation and convection had significantly improved [369] At 09:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, designating it as 19W [370] The JTWC later upgraded it to a tropical storm as it was noted that an eye-like feature was forming [371] The JMA later did the same at 00:00 UTC on September 7, naming it Chanthu [372] At 09:30 UTC, the PAGASA reported that Chanthu entered the PAR, assigning it the name Kiko [373] At 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [374] At the same moment, Chanthu started its rapid intensification as it quickly became a minimal typhoon [375] [376] Several hours later, the typhoon reached Category 4-equivalent status, and by the next day at 09:00 UTC, it reached Category 5-equivalent intensity, developing a 5 nmi (10 km; 5 mi)-wide eye which was surrounded by very compact, intense convection [377] [378] After reaching its initial peak, Chanthu was downgraded to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon as its pinhole-shaped eye started to fade [379] However, by September 10, Chanthu began to re-intensify as its eye began to clear up [380] Chanthu further intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon once again at 09:00 UTC that day [381] On 05:00 PHT on September 11 (21:00 UTC on September 10), the PAGASA reported that Chanthu passed to the east of the Babuyan Islands; [382] at 08:30 PHT (00:30 UTC), Chanthu made landfall in Ivana, Batanes as the storm began to weaken slightly [383] [384] On September 11, Chanthu began to weaken as it continued to move northwards with the presence of dry air [385] The PAGASA issued its last bulletin for Chanthu since it exited the PAR on the next day [386] By September 14, Chanthu was no longer a typhoon as it slowly moved south-eastwards towards Japan [387] Due to decreasing wind shear and marginally favorable sea surface temperatures, Chanthu strengthened enough for the JMA to re-classify it as a severe tropical storm on the next day [388] On September 17 on 09:00 UTC, Chanthu crossed near the town of Ikitsuki, Nagasaki in Japan [389] It continued to move northwards as it moved through the rugged Japanese islands, causing it to weaken significantly [390] This caused the JMA to downgrade it to a tropical storm three hours later [391] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression, as it was also undergoing extratropical transition [392] On September 18, the JTWC issued its final warning for the system [393]\n\n\nTyphoon Mindulle\nOn September 21, the JTWC spotted an area of convection formed approximately 703 nmi (1,302 km; 809 mi) from Guam [399] The system rapidly consolidated itself and formed a well-defined LLCC, [400] and thus, the system strengthened into a tropical depression on 00:00 UTC of September 22 [401] The JTWC did the same later that day, designating the system as 20W [402] At 09:00 UTC of September 23, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as its low-level circulation center became partially exposed [403] The JMA did the same three hours later, and named it Mindulle [404]\n\n\nTropical Storm Dianmu\nOn September 21 at 18:00 UTC, the JMA noted a westward-moving low-pressure area over the South China Sea near the Philippines [420] Three hours later, the JTWC recognized this system [421] By 15:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression without issuing a TCFA for the system, as it rapidly improved its convective structure and developed a low-level circulation center; [422] the JMA did the same three hours later [423] On September 23 at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it as Dianmu as it continued to move westward and come closer to the Vietnamese coastline [424] The JTWC did the same thing, three hours later [425] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its last warning on the system as it made landfall near Da Nang, Vietnam, with its low-level circulation center being hampered following landfall [426] At 06:00 UTC on September 24, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression as it moved further inland [427]\n\n\nTropical Storm Lionrock (Lannie)\nOn October 2, the JTWC noted an area of convection located approximately 495 nautical miles (917 km; 570 mi) east of Davao, Philippines [430] The next day, PAGASA had already classified the system as a tropical depression and named it Lannie [431] Lannie made its first landfall on Bucas Grande Island at 04:30 PHT (October 3, 20:00 UTC) It then made an additional seven landfalls: ones in Cagdianao in the Dinagat Islands, Liloan and Padre Burgos in Southern Leyte, Mahanay Island and Getafe in Bohol, San Fernando in Cebu, Guihulngan in Negros Oriental, and its last two landfalls at Iloc Island and El Nido, Palawan [432] [433] At 14:30 UTC of October 4, the JTWC re-issued a TCFA for the system, as it moved over the South China Sea [434] At 06:00 UTC of October 5, the JMA recognized it as a tropical depression [435] At 11:00 PHT (03:00 UTC) of October 6, the PAGASA issued its final warning [436] At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC upgraded from a monsoonal depression to a tropical depression It was designated as 22W Before landfall in Hainan, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Lionrock at 18:00 UTC [437]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Kompasu (Maring)\nOn October 6 of 18:00 UTC, the JMA noted that a low-pressure area had formed that was embedded in a large monsoonal circulation to the north of Palau [443] The system developed into a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC of the next day [444] At 09:00 UTC (17:00 PHT), the PAGASA issued its first bulletin for the first tropical depression and assigned it the name Maring [445] The JMA also noted the persistence of another, nearby tropical depression to its northeast, later named Nando [446] As it is embedded in the same monsoonal depression and due to its proximity, Nando began to merge with Maring, and therefore formed a rather broad and large circulation This prompted the JMA to upgrade the overall system to a tropical storm, and was named Kompasu [447] However at that time, the JTWC still considered the system as two separate disturbances and issued separate TCFAs later in the day for both depressions, albeit noting the possibility of merging [448] [449] The JTWC later considered the entire system as merged with their first warning for Kompasu [450] At midnight of October 11, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, as it attained good cloud characteristics [451] At 12:10 UTC (20:10 PHT), Kompasu made its first landfall near Fuga Island of Cagayan Province [452] At 05:00 PHT of October 13 (21:00 UTC of October 12), the PAGASA issued its final bulletin as its exited the PAR and continued towards Hainan [453] Between 03:00 and 09:00 UTC of October 13, Kompasu had made landfall over the east coast of Hainan [454] [455] By 18:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm, as it crossed the entire island and entered the Gulf of Tonkin, as its convection had rapidly weakened because of the rough terrain of the island [456] [457] At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC issued its final warning followed by downgrading to a tropical depression, as its convection had diminished and the low-level circulation center had been weakened significantly because of the increasing vertical wind shear and dry air, despite not making landfall over northern Vietnam [458] The JMA issued its final warning after downgrading it to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC [459] [460]\n\n\nTropical Depression Nando\nOn 00:00 UTC of October 7, the JMA began monitoring on a tropical depression that had developed to the north of Palau, that was embedded in the same monsoonal circulation as Tropical Depression Maring [463] As the circulation moved inside the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA began issuing advisories and assigned the local name Nando to the depression [464] By the next day, the JMA stopped tracking the system after it began to merge with Maring, which subsequently became Tropical Storm Kompasu [465] The PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the system on October 9 [466] The JTWC issued separate TCFAs for two invests in the monsoonal depression that contained Maring and Nando — Invests 93W and 94W, respectively [449] As the two merged, the JTWC cancelled the TCFA for Invest 93W and soon began issuing a single tropical cyclone warning for the overall system [467] [450]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Namtheun\nOn October 8, the JTWC noted an area of convection persisted approximately 289 nmi (535 km; 333 mi) from Wake Island, which had a defined low-level circulation with a good outflow [468] The JMA later recognized the same area of convection as a tropical depression on October 9 [469] At 14:00 UTC the same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the invest as it developed a flaring convection which was circulating over the obscured LLCC [470] By midnight of the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Namtheun [471] The JTWC recognized it as a tropical depression, three hours later, [472] and six hours later, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm [473] Namtheun managed to maintain its intensity for two days, until at 09:00 UTC of October 13, it was downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC, as it started moving westwards because of the presence of a subtropical ridge towards the southeast of the system Satellite imagery showed that the deep convection had been displaced towards the northeast and the LLCC of the system had become less defined [474] However at 15:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC re-upgraded it to a tropical storm, as it entered over warm sea-surface temperatures which allowed the system to maintain its intensity despite high wind shear Satellite imagery also indicated that it developed subtropical characteristics [475] Unexpectedly, Namtheun further intensified into a severe tropical storm according to JMA at 06:00 UTC of October 16, and a Category 1-equivalent typhoon according to JTWC at 09:00 UTC of October 16 [476] [477] Satellite imagery depicted that the system had developed a compact core with improved convection structure near its center It also developed an eye-like feature The weakening of the vertical wind shear was main reason for the intensification and also the presence of marginally favorable sea-surface temperatures (26–27 °C (79–81 °F)) [477] A few hours later, both JMA and JTWC downgraded to a tropical storm, as its convection had weakened significantly because of further cooling of sea-surface temperatures and strengthening of the wind shear [478] [479] Namtheun managed its intensity as it continued north-northwards but since it was interacting with the baroclinic zone, it started its extratropical transition between 00:00 and 15:00 UTC [480] [481] For the next several days, the system moved eastward across the North Pacific, before undergoing explosive intensification and developing into a bomb cyclone on October 21, reaching an extratropical peak of 951 millibars (28.1 inHg), while situated off the coast of the Pacific Northwest [482] Afterward, the system curved northward and then north-northwestward, while gradually weakening, before being absorbed into another approaching extratropical cyclone from the west, late on October 22 [483] Namtheun's extratropical remnant brought heavy rain and powerful winds to the Pacific Northwest [484] [485]\n\n\nTyphoon Malou\nOn October 20, the JTWC noted an area of convection approximately 574 nmi (1,063 km; 661 mi) east of Guam Infrared satellite imagery found that it formed a flaring convection which was displaced to the northwest from the actual center, [486] but at 06:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC discontinued giving advisories to the area of convection, as its convection had completely dissipated [487] On the same day at 18:00 UTC, the JMA recognized the same area of convection, as a low pressure area [488] At 15:00 UTC of October 22, the JTWC started giving advisories for the area of convection as it developed sufficient convection and a poorly defined low-level circulation [489] On the next day at 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression, [490] and three and a half hour later, the JTWC issued a TCFA [491] At 03:00 UTC of October 24, the JTWC upgraded to a tropical depression and designated as 25W [492] Later at 18:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as the organization of the convection had increased [493] Six hours later, the JMA did the same thing and named it Malou [494] At midday of the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [495] Early on October 27, the JTWC upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, as it developed an eye-like feature wrapped around a ragged spiral bandings [496] At 18:00 UTC the same day, the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon [497]\n\n\nTropical Depression 26W\nAt 00:00 UTC of October 22, the JMA noted the formation of a low-pressure area east of Mindanao [498] Two days later at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression as it was located off the coast of the island of Palawan [499] On the same day, the JTWC noted the same low pressure area and gave a low chance of formation, [500] which was later upgraded to medium [501] At 05:30 UTC of October 25, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, as its convection had improved and developed a weakly defined LLCC [502] On the next day, after re-issuing the TCFA at 05:00 UTC, [503] the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression at 09:00 UTC as it was located off the coast of Vietnam Satellite imagery found that its LLCC had become defined however the convective structure continued to remain disorganized [504] Between 15:00 UTC of October 26 and 03:00 UTC of October 27, the system made landfall near Nha Trang [505] [506] and at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as its convection had rapidly disorganized after landfall, as it moved over the mountainous terrain of Vietnam [506]\n\n\nTyphoon Nyatoh\nEarly of November 26, the JTWC noted the formation of an area of convection located 752 nmi (1,393 km; 865 mi) east-southeast of Guam [508] On the next day, the JMA recognized the same system as a low pressure area [509] At 06:00 UTC of November 28, the JTWC issued a TCFA as it developed a poorly defined center, [510] and by midnight of November 28, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression [511] The JTWC followed suit and designated it as 27W at 15:00 UTC the same day [512] Six hours later, the JTWC further upgraded it to a tropical storm [513] At midnight of the next day, the JMA followed suit and named it as Nyatoh [514] On 00:00 UTC of December 1, the JMA further upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [515] Fifteen hours later, the JTWC declared it a typhoon and upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent status, as Nyatoh developed an eye according to microwave imagery [516] The JMA followed suit at 18:00 UTC [517] By 03:00 UTC the next day, it further intensified into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon as it briefly formed a ragged eye [518] Later that day, Nyatoh unexpectedly rapidly intensified to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon due to jet interaction It later reached peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a pressure of 925 mb (27.32 inHg) [519] However, this peak was short-lived as strong wind shear, dry air, and cooler sea surface temperatures shredded the system apart and rapidly weakened to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon at 18:00 UTC On December 4 at 06:35 UTC, the JMA declared Nyatoh a remnant low [citation needed]\n\n\nTyphoon Rai (Odette)\nAt 00:00 UTC of December 12, the JMA noted the existence of a tropical depression in the vicinity of the Caroline Islands [520] Two hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the developing system, noting a \"promising\" environment for further development [521] On the next day, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm and gave it the international name, Rai [522]\n\n\nTropical Depression 29W\nOn December 14, the JMA upgraded a westward-moving low-pressure area to a tropical depression [542] [543] The JTWC began monitoring the system by the next day, noting the presence of a consolidated low-level circulation within the system [544] The system's chances of developing into a tropical cyclone slowly increased, [545] and on December 16 at 17:30 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system despite the outflow of Typhoon Rai partially exposing the system's low-level circulation [546] By 21:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 29W as it continued over marginally favorable developmental conditions [547] Shortly after, at 23:00 UTC, the depression made landfall north of Kuantan and began to weaken, prompting the JTWC to issue its final advisory on the system by the next day [548] The JMA stopped monitoring the system on December 17 at 12:00 UTC [549] [550]\n\n\nOther systems\nWithin the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names [584] The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC

storms developed in the Western Pacific and each one was named by the JMA, when the system was judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 kilometres per hour (40 mph) The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee [586]  During the season, the names Surigae, Koguma, Cempaka and Nyatoh were used for the first time after they replaced Mujigae, Koppu, Melor and Meranti, which were retired following the 2015 and 2016 seasons.\n\n\nRetirement\nAfter the season, on March 21, 2022,

year when typhoons formed in the western Pacific Ocean. The season began in January and ended in December.\n\n**Seasonal Forecast**\n\nDuring the year, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons would form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones would affect a particular country. These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of University College London, PAGASA, and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau.\n\nThe first forecast was released by PAGASA on December 27, 2020, in their monthly seasonal climate outlook predicting the first half of 2021. The PAGASA predicts that only 0–3 tropical cyclones are expected to form or enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility between January and March, while 1–4 tropical cyclones are expected to form between April and June. PAGASA also predicted that the ongoing La Niña could persist until the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) issued their first extended range forecast on May 11, predicting a slightly below-average season with 24 tropical storms, 15 typhoons, and 9 intense typhoons.\n\n**Seasonal Summary**\n\nThe season began in January with a weak and short-lived tropical depression. In mid-February, another tropical depression formed, before being assigned the local name Auring by the PAGASA. The system then strengthened into a tropical storm, being given the name Dujuan by the JMA, making it the first named storm of the year. The storm then made landfall in the Philippines, bringing minimal damages due to its small size.\n\nAnother tropical depression formed in March, though it was short-lived, dissipating shortly after forming. In April, a tropical depression formed to the south of Woleai, which strengthened into a tropical storm, being given the name Surigae by the JMA. Surigae became a severe tropical storm on April 15, before being upgraded to a typhoon on the next day, and to a super typhoon on April 17, making it the first of the season and the strongest recorded cyclone to form in the month of April in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn May, a new tropical depression was named Crising by the PAGASA and made landfall in Baganga, Davao Oriental as a weak tropical storm, bringing minimal damages due to its small size. Later in the month, Choi-wan formed and made landfall in the Philippines, causing widespread damages to the country.\n\nIn June, Choi-wan made several landfalls on the Philippines, making its third landfall on Balud, Masbate, its fourth on Romblon, Romblon, its fifth on San Agustin, Romblon, its sixth on Pola, Oriental Mindoro, its seventh on Tingloy, Batangas, and its eighth and final landfall on the Calatagan Peninsula before moving into the South China Sea.\n\nOn June 3, the JTWC upgraded Choi-wan back to a tropical storm, and at 03:00 UTC, the PAGASA removed all Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals as Choi-wan moved away from the country. Choi-wan then exited the PAR on June 3 at 18:00 UTC and then made landfall in Taiwan on June 5.\n\n**Tropical Storm Choi-wan (Dante)**\n\nOn June 27, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) first noted an area of disturbed weather positioned around 1,000 mi (1,610 km) south-southwest of Honolulu. Four days later, the low-pressure area crossed the International Date Line, and on July 10, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA declared it as a tropical depression. Three and a half hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA as it developed sufficient convection and a poorly defined low-level circulation.\n\nBy 21:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and designated it as 04W. Shortly after, at 23:00 UTC, the depression made landfall north of Kuantan and began to weaken, prompting the JTWC to issue its final advisory on the system by the next day. The JMA stopped monitoring the system on December 17 at 12:00 UTC.\n\n**Tropical Depression 05W**\n\nAt 00:00 UTC of October 22, the JMA noted the formation of a low-pressure area east of Mindanao. Two days later at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression as it was located off the coast of the island of Palawan. On the same day, the JTWC noted the same low pressure area and gave a low chance of formation, which was later upgraded to medium.\n\nAt 05:30 UTC of October 25, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, as its convection had improved and developed a weakly defined LLCC. On the next day, after re-issuing the TCFA at 05:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression at 09:00 UTC as it was located off the coast of Vietnam. Satellite imagery found that its LLCC had become defined however the convective structure continued to remain disorganized.\n\nBetween 15:00 UTC of October 26 and 03:00 UTC of October 27, the system made landfall near Nha Trang. At 03:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as its convection had rapidly disorganized after landfall, as it moved over the mountainous terrain of Vietnam. The JMA stopped monitoring the system on October 27 at 12:00 UTC.\n\n**Tropical Depression 12W**\n\nOn September 1, the JTWC gave a medium chance of formation for a system over the same area, despite being classified as subtropical depression, as it developed a well-defined, partially exposed low-level circulation center. At 20:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system. At 03:00 UTC the next day, it was upgraded to a tropical depression and designated as 17W, as its low-level circulation center became more defined but still partially exposed.\n\nThe system maintained its defined convective structure, however at 09:00 UTC on September 3, it struggled to consolidate because of presence of dry air causing its convective structure to diminish. At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as its remaining convection was sheared by the incoming westerlies. At 12:00 UTC on September 4, the JMA stopped tracking the system.\n\n**Typhoon Conson (Jolina)**\n\nOn September 3, a disturbance was noted by the JTWC, approximately 195 nmi (225 mi; 360 km) from Andersen Air Force Base in Yigo, Guam, as it developed a weakly defined low-level circulation center. The disturbance gradually intensified, and on September 5, the JMA recognized the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, the JTWC issued a TCFA as its low-level circulation center and its surrounding convection became well organized. The agency recognized the system as a tropical depression around four hours later.\n\nAt 21:00 UTC, the PAGASA recognized the system as a tropical depression, with the agency assigning it the local name Jolina. The next day on 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the international name Conson, with the JTWC following suit three hours later. At 12:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it typhoon before downgrading it into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC. Three hours later, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm.\n\nConson then made several landfalls on the Philippines, making a first landfall in Hernani, Eastern Samar at 02:30 PHT (18:30 UTC), a second landfall in Daram, Samar at 19:40 PHT (19:40 UTC), and a third landfall in Almagro, Samar at 22:30 PHT (22:30 UTC). At 00:00 UTC on September 7, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm as it was significantly weakened by multiple landfalls.\n\nConson then made a fifth landfall in Dimasalang, Masbate at 03:00 PHT (03:00 UTC), later weakening into a severe tropical storm, according to PAGASA. Conson then made a sixth landfall over the area in Lobo, Batangas. After making its eighth landfall at San Juan, Batangas, Conson traversed the Batangas–Cavite area as the PAGASA declared it to have weakened back into a tropical storm. Conson then made its ninth and final landfall in Mariveles, Bataan.\n\nAt 12:00 UTC, Conson re-intensified into a severe tropical storm, as it entered the West Philippine Sea. Three hours later, the PAGASA issued its final bulletin for Conson as it exited the PAR and accelerated westward.\n\n**Typhoon Chanthu (Kiko)**\n\nAt 06:00 UTC on September 5, the JTWC began monitoring an area of convection that had formed 446 nmi (513 mi; 826 km) from Legazpi, Philippines. At 18:00 UTC the same day, the JMA declared it as a tropical depression. Five and a half hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA as its circulation and convection had significantly improved. At 09:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, designating it as 19W.\n\nThe JTWC later upgraded it to a tropical storm as it was noted that an eye-like feature was forming. The JMA later did the same at 00:00 UTC on September 7, naming it Chanthu. At 09:30 UTC, the PAGASA reported that Chanthu entered the PAR, assigning it the name Kiko.\n\nChanthu then started its rapid intensification as it quickly became a minimal typhoon. Several hours later, Chanthu reached Category 4-equivalent status, and by the next day at 09:00 UTC, it reached Category 5-equivalent intensity, developing a 5 nmi (10 km; 5 mi)-wide eye which was surrounded by very compact, intense convection. After reaching its initial peak, Chanthu was downgraded to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon as its pinhole-shaped eye started to fade.\n\nHowever, by September 10, Chanthu began to re-intensify as its eye began to clear up. Chanthu further intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon once again at 09:00 UTC that day. On 05:00 PHT on September 11 (21:00 UTC on September 10), the PAGASA reported that Chanthu passed to the east of the Babuyan Islands.\n\nAt 08:30 PHT (00:30 UTC), Chanthu made landfall in Ivana, Batanes as the storm began to weaken slightly. On September 11, Chanthu began to weaken as it continued to move northwards with the presence of dry air. The PAGASA issued its last bulletin for Chanthu since it exited the PAR on the next day.\n\nBy September 14, Chanthu was no longer a typhoon as it slowly moved south-eastwards towards Japan. Due to decreasing wind shear and marginally favorable sea surface temperatures, Chanthu strengthened enough for the JMA to re-classify it as a severe tropical storm on the next day.\n\nOn September 17 on 09:00 UTC, Chanthu crossed near the town of Ikitsuki, Nagasaki in Japan. It continued to move northwards as it moved through the rugged Japanese islands, causing it to weaken significantly. This caused the JMA to downgrade it to a tropical storm three hours later.\n\nAt 21:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression, as it was also undergoing extratropical transition. On September 18, the JTWC issued its final warning followed by downgrading to a tropical depression, as its convection had diminished and the low-level circulation center had been weakened significantly because of the increasing vertical wind shear and dry air.\n\nThe JMA issued its final warning after downgrading it to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC.", "prompt": "Write a complete

by the PAGASA and made landfall on Baganga, Davao Oriental as a weak tropical storm, bringing minimal damages due to its small size Two tropical depressions formed on May 29 and 30 respectively, with the first being assigned the local name Dante by the PAGASA Dante intensified into a tropical storm, being assigned the name Choi-wan, before moving over the Philippines and making landfall eight times, bringing widespread damages to the country A tropical depression formed behind Choi-wan on May 30; it didn't develop further.\n\n\nSystems\nAt 06:00 UTC on February 16, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had formed [10] Eight hours later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system [11] By February 17, the system moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), and was assigned the local name Auring from the PAGASA [12] At 06:00 UTC on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 01W The system was later named Dujuan as the first named storm of 2021 The PAGASA later upgraded Dujuan to a severe tropical storm; however, this only lasted for six hours [13] [14] On February 20, the storm significantly weakened into a tropical depression due to high vertical wind shear Both JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories moments after [15] The storm made landfall over Batag Island in Laoang, Northern Samar at 09:00 PHT (01:00 UTC) on February 22, [16] dissipating thereafter.\n\n\nTropical Storm Dujuan (Auring)\nAt 06:00 UTC on February 16, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had formed [10] Eight hours later, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system [11] By February 17, the system moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), and was assigned the local name Auring from the PAGASA [12] At 06:00 UTC on the same day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 01W The system was later named Dujuan as the first named storm of 2021 The PAGASA later upgraded Dujuan to a severe tropical storm; however, this only lasted for six hours [13] [14] On February 20, the storm significantly weakened into a tropical depression due to high vertical wind shear Both JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories moments after [15] The storm made landfall over Batag Island in Laoang, Northern Samar at 09:00 PHT (01:00 UTC) on February 22, [16] dissipating thereafter.\n\n\nTyphoon Surigae (Bising)\nA low-pressure area south of Woleai developed into a tropical depression on April 12 [22] [23] A few hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the developing storm, with the PAGASA beginning to issue advisories for the tropical depression as it remained outside of the PAR [24] [25] On April 13, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and assigned it the designation 02W [26] At 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm and named it Surigae [27] On April 15 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Surigae to a severe tropical storm as an eye began forming [28] Later that day, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a typhoon, making it the first of the season Surigae then entered the PAGASA's Philippine Area of Responsibility, getting the local name Bising Surigae continued to rapidly intensify until it reached Category 5-equivalent super typhoon status, becoming the most intense typhoon ever recorded in the month of April [29] [30] [31] Surigae soon reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of 895 millibars (26.43 inHg), 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph), and 1-minute sustained winds of 315 km/h (195 mph) [32] [33] A few days later, on April 22, Surigae began to weaken again, with the storm's structure deteriorating and its large eye dissipating [34] Soon afterward, all of the remaining convection was sheared to the east as the storm moved over cooler waters [35] Late on April 24, JTWC and JMA declared and issued their final advisory that Surigae had become extratropical [36]\n\n\nTropical Depression 03W (Crising)\nOn May 11, the JTWC noted a persistent area of convection in the Philippine Sea, approximately 184 nmi (341 km) west of Palau [41] The JTWC issued a TCFA for the convection on May 12, as it further developed in an environment with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures [42] Just three hours later, the agency recognized that the area of convection had quickly consolidated into a tropical depression and assigned it with the identifier of 03W [43] Around the same time, the JMA had also recognized the storm as a tropical depression while it was to the east of Mindanao [44] Since the storm developed within the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA immediately named the storm Crising once the agency recognized it as a tropical depression as well, and later raised Signal No 2 warnings for areas in Mindanao [45] [46] In the early hours of May 13, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm, with the PAGASA following suit hours later [47] [48] Later that day, Crising's low-level circulation center became exposed due to wind shear, and it lost organization At 8:20 p.m Philippine Standard Time (12:20 UTC), Crising made landfall in Baganga, Davao Oriental as a weakening tropical storm It quickly degraded as soon as it made landfall, with both the JTWC and the PAGASA downgrading it to a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC [49] [50] At 03:00 UTC on that day, the PAGASA reported that the system degenerated to an area of low-pressure in the vicinity of Piagapo in Lanao del Sur, thus lifting all warning signals on Mindanao and issuing their final advisory [51] On May 14, the system dissipated over the Sulu Sea, and both the JMA and the JTWC issued their final advisories on the storm.\n\n\nTropical Storm Choi-wan (Dante)\nOn May 27, the JMA and the JTWC noted the persistence of an area of atmospheric convection about 425 nautical miles (787 km; 489 mi) south-southeast of Guam [57] The area's nearby environment exhibited low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, which were ideal conditions for tropical cyclogenesis [58] The JMA assessed the area to have developed into a tropical depression on May 29 at 06:00 UTC [59] The PAGASA made a similar assessment in a Tropical Cyclone Advisory issued at 15:00 UTC [60] The JTWC later followed with their own assessment, identifying the center of the newly developed tropical depression and assigning the designation 04W [61] As the system tracked westward, it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility at 01:00 PHT (17:00 UTC) [62] The PAGASA then named the storm Dante in its first Tropical Cyclone Bulletin for the storm [63] Dante further organized in the Philippine Sea, [64] and on May 30 at 15:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, [65] with the PAGASA doing the same at 21:00 UTC [66] On the next day at 00:00 UTC, the JMA also upgraded Dante into a tropical storm, giving it the international name Choi-wan [67] Choi-wan's center was exposed due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough from the northeast, inducing shear on the system [68] On June 1 at 12:30 UTC, Choi-wan made landfall on Sulat, Eastern Samar as a minimal tropical storm, [69] with the JTWC downgrading it to a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC [70] It made a second landfall on Cataingan at 17:00 UTC [71] Choi-wan made several more landfalls on the Philippines, making its third landfall on Balud, Masbate at 19:30 UTC It made a fourth landfall on Romblon, Romblon on June 2 at 00:00 UTC, a fifth on San Agustin, Romblon at 00:50 UTC, a sixth on Pola, Oriental Mindoro at 06:00 UTC, a seventh on Tingloy, Batangas at 11:20 UTC, and an eighth and final landfall on the Calatagan Peninsula before moving into the South China Sea [72] On June 3 at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Choi-wan back to a tropical storm [73] At 03:00 UTC, the PAGASA removed all Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals as Choi-wan moved away from the country [74] Choi-wan then exited the PAR on June 3 at 18:00 UTC [75] before weakening into a tropical depression on the next day at 06:00 UTC and re-entering the PAR at 08:00 UTC [76] Then, it passed southeast of the island of Taiwan [77] before moving out near the Okinawa Prefecture and heading towards Japan [citation needed] On June 5 at 06:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued their final advisory on the system [78] 3 hours later at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Choi-wan back into a tropical storm, [79] however at 15:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded the system to a tropical depression, also issuing their final advisory on the system [80]\n\n\nTropical Storm Koguma\nOn June 10, the JTWC started to monitor an area of low-pressure in the South China Sea, approximately 518 km (322 mi) to the south of Hong Kong, with the agency classifying the system as a monsoon depression [85] Tracking west-northwestward, the storm was located in a favorable environment for further development, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear [86] At 00:00 UTC on June 11, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical depression [87] Six hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as it began to show characteristics of a monsoon depression [88] By 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Koguma [87] On June 12 at 00:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded Koguma to a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 05W [89] Later that day, the JTWC also upgraded Koguma to a tropical storm [89] By June 12, it had made landfall southeast of Hanoi, [90] and dissipated the next day [87]\n\n\nTyphoon Champi\nAt 00:00 UTC on June 18, the JTWC started to monitor a broad area of convection nearly 250 km (160 mi) to the south-southwest of Pohnpei [92] The system remained weak as it moved northwestwards in a favorable environment for further intensification, characterized by warm sea surface temperatures, low to moderate wind shear and good outflow; the disturbance remained weak as it moved northwestwards [92] [93] The JTWC issued a TCFA on the system two days later, though the system remained disorganized [94] [95] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on June 21 [96] Meanwhile, the JTWC designated it as 06W in their first advisory on the system, with an exposed LLCC being evident on satellite imagery due to moderate wind shear, being induced by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its north [97] [98] By 21:00 on June 21, 06W made its closest passage to the south-southwest of Guam, continuing its northwest track [99] [100] On June 22, at 06:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm as it continued to move away from Guam [101] The JMA followed and upgraded the system into a tropical storm, in June 23 at 00:00 UTC, and assigned it the name Champi [102] At 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm as it turned northwestwards [103] At this time, a microwave imagery scan of Champi revealed an eye feature emerging in the system; however, this was short lived as dry air continued to impact the storm from the west [104] In addition, poleward outflow on the system remained weak on June 24, restricting Champi to significantly develop [105] However, on the next day, as a shortwave trough crossed the Ryukyu Islands, the outflow increased on the storm which allowed it to intensify further [106] On June 25, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA officially declared the storm a typhoon [107] The JTWC soon followed, upgrading it into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon [108] At this time, a Champi turned north and north-northwestwards, and subsequently reached its peak intensity of 120 km/h (75 mph) ten-minute maximum sustained winds with a minimum barometric pressure of 980 hPa (28.94 inHg) by 21:00 UTC on June 25, however it was downgraded to a tropical storm a day later [109] The storm continued to weaken as it move towards the Japanese islands, until on June 27, the JMA issued its last advisory at 12:00 UTC as the system became an extratropical low [110] The JTWC also issued its last warning for Champi at 09:00 UTC, same day [111]\n\n\nTropical Depression 07W (Emong)\nOn July 2, the JTWC started to monitor a tropical disturbance to the southwest of Guam [118] Moving northwestwards, the disturbance was located in an environment conducive for intensification in the Philippine Sea, with warm sea surface temperatures, and low wind shear, in addition to good poleward outflow, being induced by an upper-level trough to the northwest [119] [120] The JMA upgraded the broad and weak system to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on the next day, [121] followed by a TCFA being issued by the JTWC an hour and a half later [122] [123] The PAGASA subsequently upgraded the system to a tropical depression at 02:00 UTC on July 4, naming it Emong [124] [125] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression, designating it as 07W [126] On July 6, PAGASA issued its last advisory on Tropical Depression Emong at 03:00 UTC as it moved outside the PAR and also lift up the warnings which were imposed earlier in the wake of Emong [127] Meanwhile, the JMA soon followed and issued its last advisory [128] JTWC also issued its last advisory as its convection was significantly sheared and its low level circulation dissipated rapidly over six hours [129] [130]\n\n\nTropical Depression 08W\nAt 12:00 UTC on July 3, the PAGASA started to monitor a low-pressure area that developed near Torrijos, Marinduque or 149 kilometers to the south of Manila, followed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)'s advisory at 01:00 UTC on the next day, citing the system's development as \"low\" [134] [135] In the latter's analysis on the disturbance, multispectral and microwave image scans on the system showed a weak low-level circulation center over the eastern part of Mindoro with flaring convection in the western periphery [135] Traveling northwestwards, the storm was located in an environment conductive for further intensification, with warm sea surface temperatures of 30–31 °C (86–88 °F), low wind shear around the region and good equatorial outflow; however, model forecasts were split regarding the disturbance's strengthening trend [135] [136] Also that day at 15:00 UTC, the low-pressure area exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), which was followed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgrading the storm to a tropical depression roughly three hours later [137] [138] Eventually, the JTWC upgraded the system's potential intensification trend to \"high\" and subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 00:30 UTC on June 6 as a circulation became well-defined [139] It then changed its motion towards the west along the periphery of a subtropical ridge on the north and northwest as it approached the Hainan Island [140] By 06:00 UTC on the next day, the disturbance moved inland on the region near Lingshui Li Autonomous County before emerging on the Gulf of Tonkin, in an area of low to moderate wind shear [141] [142] [143] Later, the disturbance began to reorganize; however, strong wind gradient suppressed its intensification, with flaring convection displaced to the west [142] Nine hours later, the JTWC upgraded the system to a weak tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 45 km/h (30 mph); the JMA analysed the storm to be at 55 km/h (35 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000 hPa (29.53 inHg) [144] [145] [146] By the night of that day, the depression, with the identifier 08W from the JTWC made landfall on Thanh Hoa, Vietnam on that intensity, before subsequently issuing their final warning as the agency confirmed that the system dissipated inland, with the evidences of radar and satellite imagery [147] The JMA continued to monitor the system until it dissipated at 00:00 UTC on July 8 over Laos [148]\n\n\nTyphoon In-fa (Fabian)\nAt 06:00 UTC on July 14, the JTWC started to monitor an area of low pressure west-northwest of Guam [161] Located in an area favorable for intensification with warm sea surface temperatures as its outflow improved, the system struggled to develop under moderate wind shear before gradually intensifying, with the agency issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 20:30 UTC on the next day [161] [162] [163] [164] On July 16, the PAGASA upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, assigning it the local name Fabian [165] The JMA later recognized the system as a tropical depression at 03:00 UTC on the same day, [166] with the JTWC doing the same at 09:00 UTC, designating it as 09W [167] On July 18 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm assigning it the name In-fa [168] The JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical storm at 03:00 UTC The system had deep flaring convection, however its low-level circulation was broad and elongated [169] On July 18, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm [170] [171] In-fa started moving westwards, [172] and as it gradually strengthened, In-fa developed a formative eye on July 20, at 03:00 UTC [173] At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC declared In-fa to have strengthened into a typhoon as it had deep convection and robust outflow [174] [175] The JMA also followed suit and upgraded In-fa to a typhoon at 12:00 UTC because of good upper-level outflow and higher sea surface temperatures; however, its central dense overcast was still obscure [176] [177] On the next day at 03:00 UTC, In-fa strengthened into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon as its central convection continued to deepen The feeder bands became more compact and the eye of the typhoon became clearer and more defined [178] The JTWC assessed that it peaked as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon with maximum wind speeds of 175 km/h (110 mph) at 03:00 UTC the same day [179] Because of dry air, [citation needed] the JTWC later downgraded In-fa to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon at 03:00 UTC the next day despite the presence of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear [180] On July 23 at 21:00 UTC, In-fa got further downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC, as its eyewall became fragmented and the deep convection was not continuous over the eye; [181] it later re-intensified into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon again at 03:00 UTC the next day as it regained convective depths and it managed to maintain a ragged eye [182] At 09:00 UTC, PAGASA issued its final advisory as Typhoon In-fa moved northwards and exited the PAR [183] On July 24, at 06:00 UTC, In-fa peaked as a typhoon with maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a minimum pressure of 950 hPa (28.05 inHg), according to the JMA [184] On the next day, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) noted In-fa to have made landfall in Putuo Island at around 04:30 UTC [185] After making landfall, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm at 09:00 UTC as it eye structure began to degrade [186] JMA later downgraded to a severe tropical storm at 12:00 UTC, because of influence of land and involvement of dry air [187]\n\n\nTyphoon Cempaka\nOn July 17, the JMA reported that a tropical depression had formed [188] [189] The JTWC later issued a TCFA for the system, as the aforementioned area of convection became more organized [190] By the following day, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression and designated it as 10W, with the storm possessing an improved convective structure and a defined low-level circulation [191] [192] The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm at 21:00 UTC as it had a defined low-level circulation center with improved banding structure [193] At 00:00 UTC on July 19, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Cempaka [194] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC declared Cempaka to have strengthened into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon as it developed a ragged 15 nmi (28 km; 17 mi) wide eye [195] [196] The JMA later upgraded it to a severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on the next day [197] On July 20, at 06:00 UTC, Cempaka peaked as a severe tropical storm with 10-sustained maximum wind speed of 55 kn (100 km/h; 65 mph) with minimum pressure of 990 hPa (29.23 inHg), according to JMA [198] JTWC assessed that it peaked as a typhoon with maximum 1-minute sustained wind of 80 kn (150 km/h; 90 mph) [199] Cempaka made landfall near Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang, Guangdong Province, [200] and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC the same day as its low-level circulation center became obscure [201] The JMA also downgraded Cempaka to a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC the next day as it moved further inland and its central dense overcast disappeared [202] [203] At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC further downgraded Cempaka to a tropical depression as its deep convection declined; however, it still retained a well-defined wind field [204] After moving inland, Cempaka started moving westward at 00:00 UTC on July 21 due to weak steering flow [205] Remaining inland, Cempaka maintained tropical storm intensity as it continued westward, but due to unfavorable conditions over land, it weakened into a tropical depression on the next day at 00:00 UTC [206] On July 22, at 09:00 UTC, Cempaka then moved southwards towards the Gulf of Tonkin because of the influence of the monsoonal westerlies, while maintaining its tropical depression intensity inland [207] Cempaka moved southward, crossed Móng Cái, Quảng Ninh Province in Vietnam and later entered the Gulf of Tonkin at 03:00 UTC [208] However, Cempaka further weakened despite the presence of warm sea surface temperatures because of high monsoonal wind shear and land interaction [209] [210] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system as it became a weakly defined system with an exposed low-level circulation center over Bạch Long Vĩ Island [211] On July 26 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its last advisory [212]\n\n\nTropical Storm Nepartak\nAt 06:00 UTC on July 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a tropical disturbance with subtropical features along the eastern portion of a monsoon trough, located approximately 466 nmi (865 km; 535 mi) to the north of Guam A weak system, multispectral satellite imageries revealed that the disturbance was disorganized along the said trough, while advanced scaterrometer data showed the same feature with southerly convergent flow over the northern Mariana Islands Environmental analysis depicted an unfavorable amount of wind shear, although the agency noted that the disturbance could form as a subtropical cyclone along the subtropical trough with the help of baroclinity [220] Tracking northeastward, the system slowly organized, with a low-level circulation center developing seen on meteorological satellite imageries The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the disturbance as a tropical depression, seventeen hours later while the JTWC upgraded the system's potential intensification trend from \"medium\" to \"high\" and subsequently issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the storm at 22:30 UTC that day [221] [222] [223] At 12:00 UTC, Dvorak intensity observations and surface wind data from satellite scatterometer confirmed that the depression further intensified to the eighth tropical storm of the season, whereupon the JMA named it as Nepartak [224] The JTWC, however only issued its first warning on Nepartak as Tropical Depression 11W, three hours later as its LLCC further became broad and exposed with its center remaining weakly defined while being steered on the continued direction by a north–south oriented subtropical ridge [225] [226] Nine hours later, the agency further upgraded the system to a subtropical storm as vigorous deep convection further became constant on the east of the still-exposed and elongated circulation center [227] [228] By July 24, Nepartak was guided north-northeastwards by an upper-level low and a trough Baroclinic interaction with the latter also led to the development of a large and asymmetric wind field, with the maximum sustained winds of 35 kn (40 mph; 65 km/h) being far from the center [228] [229] Later, the system's core became ragged as it turned northwards and further northeast before shifting north again while remaining at that intensity At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC noted two distinct vorticities, being spaced 350 nmi (650 km; 405 mi) to each other, with each having an elongated circulation from the south-southwest to the north-northeast [230] [231]\n\n\nTropical Depression 12W\nOn August 1, the JTWC issued a TCFA for a disturbance in the open western Pacific as it had an ill-defined low-level circulation center and deep convection [243] On the next day, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA recognized it as a tropical depression as it was located near Minami-Tori-shima It was moving northwards at 10 kn (19 km/h; 12 mph) [244] A few hours later, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the designation 12W At that time, the LLC of the storm remained exposed and its strongest convection or thunderstorms were displaced to the west [245] A deep-layered subtropical ridge to the east guided the depression to move to the north-northwest while being near from a monsoon gyre [245] Despite being located in a favorable environment for additional strengthening, another system to the south slowly interacted with the depression, which weakened the storm's intensity It reached its peak intensity that day, with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) in the estimates of the JMA and the JTWC [246] [247] By August 3, the JTWC downgraded 12W to a disturbance as its structure deteriorated; [248] the agency upgraded it back to a tropical depression a day later [249] The system's LLC then became fully exposed, [250] and on August 6, both the JTWC and the JMA assessed that 12W had dissipated [249] [251]\n\n\nTropical Storm Lupit (Huaning)\nOn August 2, the JMA noted a tropical depression near Zhanjiang had formed [252] Soon afterwards, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the disturbance situated approximately 153 nm west-southwest of Hong Kong [253] On the same day at 21:00 UTC, the JTWC assessed the system as a tropical depression and accordingly designated it as 13W [254] Twenty-four hours later, the agency upgraded the system to a tropical storm [255] On August 4 at 12:00 UTC, the JMA followed suit and designated the system as a tropical storm, assigning it the name Lupit [256] A day later at 03:20 UTC, it made landfall over Nan'ao County in Shantou, Guangdong Province [citation needed] At 08:50 UTC, it made another landfall over Dongshan County in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province [257] On August 7, it headed eastward and briefly entered the PAR, and was named Huaning by PAGASA [258] On August 8, at 18:00 UTC, Lupit peaked as a tropical storm with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 45 kn (85 km/h; 50 mph) and minimum pressure of 985 mb (29.09 inHg) [259] Maximum 1-minute sustained speed of Lupit was 45 kn (85 km/h; 50 mph) [260] On August 9, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its final warning, as it completed its extratropical transition [261] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC followed and issued its final warning [262]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Mirinae (Gorio)\nOn August 3, at 18:00 UTC, the JMA issued a tropical cyclone advisory for a tropical depression which was located off the east coast of Taiwan and north of the Philippines [267] The JMA later issued its first prognostic reasoning at the same time, stating that clusters of convective bursts were scattered around the low-level circulation [268] At 22:00 UTC, the same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, as it had a consolidating low-level circulation, and it was located in a very conductive environment with high sea surface temperatures and low to moderate vertical wind shear [269] On the next day, at 03:00 UTC, the PAGASA recognized it as a tropical depression and named it Gorio, as it was located inside the PAR [270] At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC did the same and designated it as 14W, as satellite imagery showed a fully exposed mesovortex [271] [272] On August 5, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm, naming it as Mirinae Clusters of convective bursts were gathering around the center with a curved manner, with Mirinae having distinct anticyclonic outflow [273] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC followed and upgraded it to a tropical storm, as the storm developed a partially exposed low-level circulation center Flaring convection was present, though it was affected by moderate westerly wind shear [274] [275] On August 7, at 18:00 UTC, Mirinae peaked as a tropical storm with maximum 10-sustained wind speed of 50 kn (95 km/h; 60 mph) and minimum barometric pressure of 980 mb (28.94 inHg) [276] Maximum 1-minute sustained wind speed of Mirinae was 55 kn (100 km/h; 65 mph) [277] On August 9, at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final warning for the system [278] The JMA later issued its last warning on the next day at 00:00 UTC, as it became an extratropical cyclone [279]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Nida\nOn August 3, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA noted a tropical depression north of the Mariana Islands which was moving northwards at 10 kn (19 km/h; 12 mph) [280] At 03:00 UTC, the next day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system By that time, it had developed a partially obscured low-level circulation center [281] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC recognized it as a tropical depression, designating it as 15W [282] On August 5, 03:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as its low-level circulation center became more defined [283] [284] Three hours later, the JMA followed and named it Nida Satellite imagery showed that convective bursts were organized into a curved band and that the system was exhibiting good anticyclone outflow [285] On August 6, at 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, as it had distinct anticyclonic outflow [286] Nida then started moving eastwards at 6:00 UTC the next day, because of a mid-level subtropical high-pressure area along with the westerlies [287] On August 7, at 09:00 UTC, the JTWC issued the last advisory for the system, as its low-level circulation center was partly exposed due to the westerlies inflicting shear upon the storm [288] However, the JMA continued to publish bulletins for the system Nida continued its trajectory On August 7, 12:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm due to shear and a generally less conductive environment [289] The JMA further downgraded it to an extratropical low at 00:00 UTC the next day as it completed its extratropical transition [290]\n\n\nTropical Storm Omais (Isang)\nOn August 6, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) first noted an area of disturbed weather positioned around 1,000 mi (1,610 km) south-southwest of Honolulu [291] Four days later, the low-pressure area crossed the International Date Line, and on August 10, at 06:00 UTC, the JMA declared it as a tropical depression as it was located northeast of Ratak [292] [293] By 13:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as satellite imagery showed it had developed a well-defined low-level circulation [294] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC recognized it as a tropical depression and designated it as 16W as satellite imagery depicted developing spiral bands and a defined low-level circulation center [295] [296] The system briefly became a tropical storm; [297] However, at 21:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression [298] as its convection struggled to organize itself [299] It regained its intensity at 09:00 UTC the next day [300] as its convection became more organized Satellite imagery also continued to indicate the presence of a well-defined low-level circulation center [301] It was downgraded to a tropical depression again on the next day [302] as its low-level circulation center became less defined [303] On August 16, at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its final advisory for the system, losing its tropical cyclone characteristics because of unfavorable conditions [304] Later at 00:00 UTC, the next day, the JMA started tracking the system again [305] At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as the system's convection became further disorganized despite the presence of a marginally favorable environment [306] At 19:30 UTC on August 18, the JTWC issued a TCFA for its remnants as its low-level circulation center improved significantly [307] On August 19, the system was upgraded by PAGASA to a tropical depression, and a few hours later, it received the local name Isang as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility [308] At 15:00 UTC, the system was re-upgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC, [309] as its deep convection started to become more organized over the low-level center [310] On August 20, at 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded to a tropical storm, naming it as Omais Favorable conditions like high sea-surface temperatures, high tropical cyclone heat potential, and low wind shear helped it to develop over the past few hours [311] The JTWC did the same thing at 21:00 UTC, the same day [312] At 18:00 UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm as satellite imagery showed convective bursts gathering around the center in a curved manner; [313] however, shortly after at 06:00 UTC on August 22, it weakened into a tropical storm due to increasing wind shear from the westerlies [314] At 03:00 UTC on August 23, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression [315] as its convection was severely affected by the extremely high westerly wind shear [316] On August 24 at 00:00 UTC, the JMA issued its final advisory as the system became an extratropical cyclone over the Sea of Japan [317] Nine hours later, the JTWC followed and issued its last warning for Omais [318]\n\n\nTropical Depression 17W\nOn September 1 on 00:00 UTC, the JMA noticed a tropical depression near Wake Island [322] At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC gave a medium chance of formation for the system over the same area, despite being classified as subtropical depression, as it developed a well defined, partially exposed low-level circulation center [323] At 20:00 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, [324] and at 03:00 UTC the next day, it was upgraded to a tropical depression and was designated as 17W, [325] as its low-level circulation center became more defined but still partially exposed [326] The system maintained its defined convective structure, [327] [328] [329] [330] however at 09:00 UTC on September 3, it struggled to consolidate because of presence of dry air causing its convective structure to diminish [331] [332] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as its remaining convection was sheared by the incoming westerlies [333] At 12:00 UTC on September 4, the JMA stopped tracking the system [334]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Conson (Jolina)\nOn September 3, a disturbance was noted by the JTWC, approximately 195 nmi (225 mi; 360 km) from Andersen Air Force Base in Yigo, Guam, as it developed a weakly defined low-level circulation center [335] The disturbance gradually intensified, and on September 5, the JMA recognized the system as a tropical depression [336] Later that day, the JTWC issued a TCFA as its low-level circulation center and its surrounding convection became well organized [337] The agency recognized the system as a tropical depression around four hours later [338] At 21:00 UTC, the PAGASA recognized the system as a tropical depression, with the agency assigning it the local name Jolina [339] The next day on 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the international name Conson, with the JTWC following suit three hours later [340] [341] At 12:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it typhoon before downgrading it into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC [342] Three hours later, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [343] At the same moment, Conson rapidly intensified into a typhoon according to the PAGASA as it made its first landfall on Hernani, Eastern Samar [344] Conson then made another landfall at 02:30 PHT (18:30 UTC) in Daram, Samar, and another one at 03:40 PHT (19:40 UTC) in Santo Niño, Samar [345] At 06:30 PHT (22:30 UTC), Conson made a fourth landfall in Almagro, Samar At 00:00 UTC on September 7, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm as it was significantly weakened by multiple landfalls [346] Conson then made a fifth landfall in Dimasalang, Masbate at 11:00 PHT (03:00 UTC), later weakening into a severe tropical storm, according to PAGASA [347] [348] Conson then made a sixth landfall over Torrijos, Marinduque [349] Conson continued to pummel through more islands, making a seventh landfall over the area in Lobo, Batangas [350] After making its eighth landfall at San Juan, Batangas, Conson traversed the Batangas – Cavite area as the PAGASA declared it to have weakened back into a tropical storm [351] Conson made its ninth and final landfall in the vicinity of Mariveles, Bataan [352] At 12:00 UTC, Conson re-intensified into a severe tropical storm, as it entered the West Philippine Sea [353] Three hours later, the PAGASA issued its final bulletin for Conson as it exited the PAR and accelerated westward [354]\n\n\nTyphoon Chanthu (Kiko)\nAt 06:00 UTC on September 5, the JTWC began monitoring an area of convection that had formed 446 nmi (513 mi; 826 km) from Legazpi, Philippines [367] At 18:00 UTC the same day, the JMA declared it as a tropical depression [368] Five and half hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA as its circulation and convection had significantly improved [369] At 09:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, designating it as 19W [370] The JTWC later upgraded it to a tropical storm as it was noted that an eye-like feature was forming [371] The JMA later did the same at 00:00 UTC on September 7, naming it Chanthu [372] At 09:30 UTC, the PAGASA reported that Chanthu entered the PAR, assigning it the name Kiko [373] At 12:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [374] At the same moment, Chanthu started its rapid intensification as it quickly became a minimal typhoon [375] [376] Several hours later, the typhoon reached Category 4-equivalent status, and by the next day at 09:00 UTC, it reached Category 5-equivalent intensity, developing a 5 nmi (10 km; 5 mi)-wide eye which was surrounded by very compact, intense convection [377] [378] After reaching its initial peak, Chanthu was downgraded to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon as its pinhole-shaped eye started to fade [379] However, by September 10, Chanthu began to re-intensify as its eye began to clear up [380] Chanthu further intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon once again at 09:00 UTC that day [381] On 05:00 PHT on September 11 (21:00 UTC on September 10), the PAGASA reported that Chanthu passed to the east of the Babuyan Islands; [382] at 08:30 PHT (00:30 UTC), Chanthu made landfall in Ivana, Batanes as the storm began to weaken slightly [383] [384] On September 11, Chanthu began to weaken as it continued to move northwards with the presence of dry air [385] The PAGASA issued its last bulletin for Chanthu since it exited the PAR on the next day [386] By September 14, Chanthu was no longer a typhoon as it slowly moved south-eastwards towards Japan [387] Due to decreasing wind shear and marginally favorable sea surface temperatures, Chanthu strengthened enough for the JMA to re-classify it as a severe tropical storm on the next day [388] On September 17 on 09:00 UTC, Chanthu crossed near the town of Ikitsuki, Nagasaki in Japan [389] It continued to move northwards as it moved through the rugged Japanese islands, causing it to weaken significantly [390] This caused the JMA to downgrade it to a tropical storm three hours later [391] At 21:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression, as it was also undergoing extratropical transition [392] On September 18, the JTWC issued its final warning for the system [393]\n\n\nTyphoon Mindulle\nOn September 21, the JTWC spotted an area of convection formed approximately 703 nmi (1,302 km; 809 mi) from Guam [399] The system rapidly consolidated itself and formed a well-defined LLCC, [400] and thus, the system strengthened into a tropical depression on 00:00 UTC of September 22 [401] The JTWC did the same later that day, designating the system as 20W [402] At 09:00 UTC of September 23, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as its low-level circulation center became partially exposed [403] The JMA did the same three hours later, and named it Mindulle [404]\n\n\nTropical Storm Dianmu\nOn September 21 at 18:00 UTC, the JMA noted a westward-moving low-pressure area over the South China Sea near the Philippines [420] Three hours later, the JTWC recognized this system [421] By 15:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression without issuing a TCFA for the system, as it rapidly improved its convective structure and developed a low-level circulation center; [422] the JMA did the same three hours later [423] On September 23 at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it as Dianmu as it continued to move westward and come closer to the Vietnamese coastline [424] The JTWC did the same thing, three hours later [425] At 15:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its last warning on the system as it made landfall near Da Nang, Vietnam, with its low-level circulation center being hampered following landfall [426] At 06:00 UTC on September 24, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical depression as it moved further inland [427]\n\n\nTropical Storm Lionrock (Lannie)\nOn October 2, the JTWC noted an area of convection located approximately 495 nautical miles (917 km; 570 mi) east of Davao, Philippines [430] The next day, PAGASA had already classified the system as a tropical depression and named it Lannie [431] Lannie made its first landfall on Bucas Grande Island at 04:30 PHT (October 3, 20:00 UTC) It then made an additional seven landfalls: ones in Cagdianao in the Dinagat Islands, Liloan and Padre Burgos in Southern Leyte, Mahanay Island and Getafe in Bohol, San Fernando in Cebu, Guihulngan in Negros Oriental, and its last two landfalls at Iloc Island and El Nido, Palawan [432] [433] At 14:30 UTC of October 4, the JTWC re-issued a TCFA for the system, as it moved over the South China Sea [434] At 06:00 UTC of October 5, the JMA recognized it as a tropical depression [435] At 11:00 PHT (03:00 UTC) of October 6, the PAGASA issued its final warning [436] At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC upgraded from a monsoonal depression to a tropical depression It was designated as 22W Before landfall in Hainan, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Lionrock at 18:00 UTC [437]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Kompasu (Maring)\nOn October 6 of 18:00 UTC, the JMA noted that a low-pressure area had formed that was embedded in a large monsoonal circulation to the north of Palau [443] The system developed into a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC of the next day [444] At 09:00 UTC (17:00 PHT), the PAGASA issued its first bulletin for the first tropical depression and assigned it the name Maring [445] The JMA also noted the persistence of another, nearby tropical depression to its northeast, later named Nando [446] As it is embedded in the same monsoonal depression and due to its proximity, Nando began to merge with Maring, and therefore formed a rather broad and large circulation This prompted the JMA to upgrade the overall system to a tropical storm, and was named Kompasu [447] However at that time, the JTWC still considered the system as two separate disturbances and issued separate TCFAs later in the day for both depressions, albeit noting the possibility of merging [448] [449] The JTWC later considered the entire system as merged with their first warning for Kompasu [450] At midnight of October 11, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm, as it attained good cloud characteristics [451] At 12:10 UTC (20:10 PHT), Kompasu made its first landfall near Fuga Island of Cagayan Province [452] At 05:00 PHT of October 13 (21:00 UTC of October 12), the PAGASA issued its final bulletin as its exited the PAR and continued towards Hainan [453] Between 03:00 and 09:00 UTC of October 13, Kompasu had made landfall over the east coast of Hainan [454] [455] By 18:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm, as it crossed the entire island and entered the Gulf of Tonkin, as its convection had rapidly weakened because of the rough terrain of the island [456] [457] At 09:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC issued its final warning followed by downgrading to a tropical depression, as its convection had diminished and the low-level circulation center had been weakened significantly because of the increasing vertical wind shear and dry air, despite not making landfall over northern Vietnam [458] The JMA issued its final warning after downgrading it to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC [459] [460]\n\n\nTropical Depression Nando\nOn 00:00 UTC of October 7, the JMA began monitoring on a tropical depression that had developed to the north of Palau, that was embedded in the same monsoonal circulation as Tropical Depression Maring [463] As the circulation moved inside the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA began issuing advisories and assigned the local name Nando to the depression [464] By the next day, the JMA stopped tracking the system after it began to merge with Maring, which subsequently became Tropical Storm Kompasu [465] The PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the system on October 9 [466] The JTWC issued separate TCFAs for two invests in the monsoonal depression that contained Maring and Nando — Invests 93W and 94W, respectively [449] As the two merged, the JTWC cancelled the TCFA for Invest 93W and soon began issuing a single tropical cyclone warning for the overall system [467] [450]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Namtheun\nOn October 8, the JTWC noted an area of convection persisted approximately 289 nmi (535 km; 333 mi) from Wake Island, which had a defined low-level circulation with a good outflow [468] The JMA later recognized the same area of convection as a tropical depression on October 9 [469] At 14:00 UTC the same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the invest as it developed a flaring convection which was circulating over the obscured LLCC [470] By midnight of the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it Namtheun [471] The JTWC recognized it as a tropical depression, three hours later, [472] and six hours later, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm [473] Namtheun managed to maintain its intensity for two days, until at 09:00 UTC of October 13, it was downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC, as it started moving westwards because of the presence of a subtropical ridge towards the southeast of the system Satellite imagery showed that the deep convection had been displaced towards the northeast and the LLCC of the system had become less defined [474] However at 15:00 UTC of the next day, the JTWC re-upgraded it to a tropical storm, as it entered over warm sea-surface temperatures which allowed the system to maintain its intensity despite high wind shear Satellite imagery also indicated that it developed subtropical characteristics [475] Unexpectedly, Namtheun further intensified into a severe tropical storm according to JMA at 06:00 UTC of October 16, and a Category 1-equivalent typhoon according to JTWC at 09:00 UTC of October 16 [476] [477] Satellite imagery depicted that the system had developed a compact core with improved convection structure near its center It also developed an eye-like feature The weakening of the vertical wind shear was main reason for the intensification and also the presence of marginally favorable sea-surface temperatures (26–27 °C (79–81 °F)) [477] A few hours later, both JMA and JTWC downgraded to a tropical storm, as its convection had weakened significantly because of further cooling of sea-surface temperatures and strengthening of the wind shear [478] [479] Namtheun managed its intensity as it continued north-northwards but since it was interacting with the baroclinic zone, it started its extratropical transition between 00:00 and 15:00 UTC [480] [481] For the next several days, the system moved eastward across the North Pacific, before undergoing explosive intensification and developing into a bomb cyclone on October 21, reaching an extratropical peak of 951 millibars (28.1 inHg), while situated off the coast of the Pacific Northwest [482] Afterward, the system curved northward and then north-northwestward, while gradually weakening, before being absorbed into another approaching extratropical cyclone from the west, late on October 22 [483] Namtheun's extratropical remnant brought heavy rain and powerful winds to the Pacific Northwest [484] [485]\n\n\nTyphoon Malou\nOn October 20, the JTWC noted an area of convection approximately 574 nmi (1,063 km; 661 mi) east of Guam Infrared satellite imagery found that it formed a flaring convection which was displaced to the northwest from the actual center, [486] but at 06:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC discontinued giving advisories to the area of convection, as its convection had completely dissipated [487] On the same day at 18:00 UTC, the JMA recognized the same area of convection, as a low pressure area [488] At 15:00 UTC of October 22, the JTWC started giving advisories for the area of convection as it developed sufficient convection and a poorly defined low-level circulation [489] On the next day at 18:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression, [490] and three and a half hour later, the JTWC issued a TCFA [491] At 03:00 UTC of October 24, the JTWC upgraded to a tropical depression and designated as 25W [492] Later at 18:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, as the organization of the convection had increased [493] Six hours later, the JMA did the same thing and named it Malou [494] At midday of the next day, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [495] Early on October 27, the JTWC upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon, as it developed an eye-like feature wrapped around a ragged spiral bandings [496] At 18:00 UTC the same day, the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon [497]\n\n\nTropical Depression 26W\nAt 00:00 UTC of October 22, the JMA noted the formation of a low-pressure area east of Mindanao [498] Two days later at 06:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded it to a tropical depression as it was located off the coast of the island of Palawan [499] On the same day, the JTWC noted the same low pressure area and gave a low chance of formation, [500] which was later upgraded to medium [501] At 05:30 UTC of October 25, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system, as its convection had improved and developed a weakly defined LLCC [502] On the next day, after re-issuing the TCFA at 05:00 UTC, [503] the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression at 09:00 UTC as it was located off the coast of Vietnam Satellite imagery found that its LLCC had become defined however the convective structure continued to remain disorganized [504] Between 15:00 UTC of October 26 and 03:00 UTC of October 27, the system made landfall near Nha Trang [505] [506] and at 03:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its final advisory as its convection had rapidly disorganized after landfall, as it moved over the mountainous terrain of Vietnam [506]\n\n\nTyphoon Nyatoh\nEarly of November 26, the JTWC noted the formation of an area of convection located 752 nmi (1,393 km; 865 mi) east-southeast of Guam [508] On the next day, the JMA recognized the same system as a low pressure area [509] At 06:00 UTC of November 28, the JTWC issued a TCFA as it developed a poorly defined center, [510] and by midnight of November 28, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression [511] The JTWC followed suit and designated it as 27W at 15:00 UTC the same day [512] Six hours later, the JTWC further upgraded it to a tropical storm [513] At midnight of the next day, the JMA followed suit and named it as Nyatoh [514] On 00:00 UTC of December 1, the JMA further upgraded it to a severe tropical storm [515] Fifteen hours later, the JTWC declared it a typhoon and upgraded it to a Category 1-equivalent status, as Nyatoh developed an eye according to microwave imagery [516] The JMA followed suit at 18:00 UTC [517] By 03:00 UTC the next day, it further intensified into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon as it briefly formed a ragged eye [518] Later that day, Nyatoh unexpectedly rapidly intensified to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon due to jet interaction It later reached peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a pressure of 925 mb (27.32 inHg) [519] However, this peak was short-lived as strong wind shear, dry air, and cooler sea surface temperatures shredded the system apart and rapidly weakened to a Category 1-equivalent typhoon at 18:00 UTC On December 4 at 06:35 UTC, the JMA declared Nyatoh a remnant low [citation needed]\n\n\nTyphoon Rai (Odette)\nAt 00:00 UTC of December 12, the JMA noted the existence of a tropical depression in the vicinity of the Caroline Islands [520] Two hours later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the developing system, noting a \"promising\" environment for further development [521] On the next day, the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm and gave it the international name, Rai [522]\n\n\nTropical Depression 29W\nOn December 14, the JMA upgraded a westward-moving low-pressure area to a tropical depression [542] [543] The JTWC began monitoring the system by the next day, noting the presence of a consolidated low-level circulation within the system [544] The system's chances of developing into a tropical cyclone slowly increased, [545] and on December 16 at 17:30 UTC, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system despite the outflow of Typhoon Rai partially exposing the system's low-level circulation [546] By 21:00 UTC, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, assigning it the designation 29W as it continued over marginally favorable developmental conditions [547] Shortly after, at 23:00 UTC, the depression made landfall north of Kuantan and began to weaken, prompting the JTWC to issue its final advisory on the system by the next day [548] The JMA stopped monitoring the system on December 17 at 12:00 UTC [549] [550]\n\n\nOther systems\nWithin the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names [584] The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph) [585] PAGASA names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it [584] The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee [585] Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season Unused names are marked in gray.\n\n\nStorm names\nWithin the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names [584] The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h (40 mph) [585] PAGASA names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it [584] The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee [585] Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season Unused names are marked in gray.\n\n\nInternational names\nDuring the season, 22 tropical storms developed in the Western Pacific and each one was named by the JMA, when the system was judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 kilometres per hour (40 mph) The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee [586]  During the season, the names Surigae, Koguma, Cempaka and

{"title": "Maldives", "content": "\nEtymology\nAccording to legends, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis [22] The first Kingdom of the Maldives was known as Dheeva Maari Kingdom [23] During the 3rd century BCE visit of emissaries, it was noted that the Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal [22]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 6th–5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms [22] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends [39]\n\n\nAncient history and settlement\nIn the 6th–5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms [22] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends [39]\n\n\nBuddhist period\nDespite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400 year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today The Maldivian language, early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom [45]\n\n\nIslamic period\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of the Maldives, Dhovemi, converted to Islam in the year 1153 (or 1193) Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness.\n\n\nProtectorate period\nIn 1558, the Portuguese established a small garrison with a Viador (Viyazoaru), or overseer of a factory (trading post) in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in Goa Their attempts to forcefully impose Christianity with the threat of death provoked a local revolt led by Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'uẓam, his two brothers and Dhuvaafaru Dhandahele, who fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of the Maldives This event is now commemorated as National Day which is known as Qaumee Dhuvas (literally meaning \"National\" and \"Day\") It is celebrated on 1st of Rabi' al-Awwal, the third month of Hijri (Islamic) calendar.\n\n\nIndependence and republic\nWhen the British became increasingly unable to continue their colonial hold on Asia and were losing their colonies to the indigenous populations who wanted freedom, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which formally ended the British authority on the defence and external affairs of the Maldives [60] The islands thus achieved independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Colombo After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi, who declared himself King upon independence [61]\n\n\n21st century\nThe Maldives were devastated by a tsunami on 26 December 2004, following the Indian Ocean earthquake Only nine islands were reported to have escaped any flooding, [73] [74] while fifty-seven islands faced serious damage to critical infrastructure, fourteen islands had to be totally evacuated, and six islands were destroyed A further twenty-one resort islands were forced to close because of tsunami damage The total damage was estimated at more than US$400 million, or some 62% of the GDP [75] 102 Maldivians and 6 foreigners reportedly died in the tsunami [70] The destructive impact of the waves on the low-lying islands was mitigated by the fact there was no continental shelf or land mass upon which the waves could gain height The tallest waves were reported to be 14 feet (4.3 m) high [76]\n\n\nGeography\nThe Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls, that stretch along a length of 871 kilometres (541 miles) north to south, 130 kilometres (81 miles) east to west, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi), of which only 298 km2 (115 sq mi) is dry land, making this one of the world's most dispersed countries It lies between latitudes 1°S and 8°N, and longitudes 72° and 74°E The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submarine ridge 960 kilometres (600 mi) long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification, which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon Two seasons dominate the Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms [97]\n\n\nSea level rise\nIn 1988, Maldivian authorities claimed that sea rise would \"completely cover this Indian Ocean nation of 1,196 small islands within the next 30 years.\" [101]\n\n\nEnvironment\nEnvironmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste disposal and sand theft Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little litter can be found on the islands, most waste disposal sites are often substandard The bulk of the waste from Malé and nearby resorts in the Maldives are disposed of at Thilafushi, an industrial island on top of a lagoon reclaimed in the early '90s to sort waste management issues which had plagued the capital and surrounding islands [112]\n\n\nMarine ecosystem\nThe Maldives have a range of different habitats including deep sea, shallow coast, and reef ecosystems, fringing mangroves, wetlands and dry land There are 187 species of coral forming the coral reefs This area of the Indian Ocean, alone, houses 1,100 species of fish, 5 species of sea turtle, 21 species of whale and dolphin, 400 species of mollusc, and 83 species of echinoderms The area is also populated by a number of crustacean species: 120 copepods, 15 amphipods, as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species [114]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe wildlife of the Maldives includes the flora and fauna of the islands, reefs, and the surrounding ocean Recent scientific studies suggest that the fauna varies greatly between atolls following a north–south gradient, but important differences between neighbouring atolls were also found (especially in terms of sea animals), which may be linked to differences in fishing pressure — including poaching [121]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Maldives is a presidential constitutional republic, with extensive influence of the president as head of government and head of state The president heads the executive branch, and appoints the cabinet which is approved by the People's Majlis (Parliament) He leads the armed forces The current president serving since 17 November 2023 is Mohamed Muizzu [128] [129] President of the Maldives and Members of the unicameral Majlis serve five-year terms [130] The total number of members are determined by atoll populations At the 2024 parliamentary election, the People's National Congress (PNC) won a super-majority over the 93 constituencies [131]\n\n\nLaw\nAccording to the Constitution of Maldives, \"the judges are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and the law When deciding matters on which the Constitution or the law is silent, judges must consider Islamic Shari'ah\" [139]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince 1996, the Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the Indian Ocean Commission In 2002, the Maldives began to express interest in the commission but as of 2008 [update] had not applied for membership Maldives' interest relates to its identity as a small island state, especially economic development and environmental preservation, and its desire for closer relations with France, a main actor in the IOC region.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Maldives National Defence Force is the combined security organisation responsible for defending the security and sovereignty of the Maldives, having the primary task of being responsible for attending to all internal and external security needs of the Maldives, including the protection of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the maintenance of peace and security [157] The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps, Defence Intelligence Service, Military Police, Corps of Engineers, Special Protection Group, Medical Corps, Adjutant General's Corps, Air Corps, and Fire and Rescue Service The Maldives has an arrangement with India allowing cooperation on radar coverage.\n\n\nHuman rights\nHuman rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue In its 2011 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House declared the Maldives \"Partly Free\", claiming a reform process which had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled [159] The United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption, lack of religious freedom, abuse, and unequal treatment of women [160]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe Maldives has twenty-six natural atolls and few island groups on isolated reefs, all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (17 administrative atolls and cities of Malé, Addu, Fuvahmulah, Thinadhoo, and Kulhudhuffushi) [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, the Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells, an international currency of the early ages From the 2nd century CE, the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs [163] Monetaria moneta were used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade [164] The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority.\n\n\nTourism\nThe Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s Only 200 islands are home to its 382,751 inhabitants [167] [168] The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.\n\n\nVisitors\nVisitors to the Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival, regardless of their country of origin, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country [174]\n\n\nFishing industry\nFor many centuries the Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on fishing and other marine products Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe largest ethnic group is Dhivehin, i.e the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of Minicoy in Union territory of Lakshadweep, India They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population.\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in the Maldives [2]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official and national language is Dhivehi, an Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhala language of Sri Lanka The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the eveyla akuru script, which is found in the historical recording of kings (raadhavalhi) Later a script called Dhives akuru was used for a long period The present-day script is called Thaana and is written from right to left Thaana is derived from a mix of the old indigenous script of Dhives akuru and Arabic abjad Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of Mohamed Thakurufaanu.\n\n\nPopulation by locality\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative reports that Maldives is meeting 5.1 of 10 of the expected fulfillment for the right to health considering its income level [192] Specifically for children's health rights, Maldives attains 98.0% of the anticipated level based on its current income [192]  Regarding adult health rights, the country achieves 99.7% of the expected fulfillment considering its income level However, in terms of reproductive health rights, Maldives falls into the \"very bad\" category, as it fulfills only 18.2% of the expected achievement based on its available resources [193]\n\n\nHealth\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative reports that Maldives is meeting 5.1 of 10 of the expected fulfillment for

capital city Malé and is connected by a bridge International travel is available on government-owned Island Aviation Services (branded as Maldivian), which operates DHC-6 Twin Otter seaplanes and to nearly all Maldivian domestic airports with several Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft, and one Airbus A320 with international service to India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\n\nEducation\nThe Maldives National University is one of the country's institutions of higher education [f] [201] In 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health [202] The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades [203] In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry [204]  In 1991, the

Maldives are deeply ingrained in the culture of the island nation, with a diverse array of activities reflecting both traditional pastimes and modern sporting pursuits Given its unique geography of scattered islands surrounded by the Indian Ocean, water sports naturally hold a prominent position Surfing, in particular, has gained international recognition, with waves that cater to both beginners and seasoned surfers Locations such as the atolls of North and South Malé, Thulusdhoo, and Himmafushi offer ideal conditions for enthusiasts to ride the waves throughout the years [215] Additionally, diving and snorkeling are immensely popular, allowing locals and tourists alike to explore the rich marine life that thrives in the crystal-clear waters surrounding the Maldives [216]\n\n\nSee also\n

"prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Maldives\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nAccording to legends, the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis [22] The first Kingdom of the Maldives was known as Dheeva Maari Kingdom [23] During the 3rd century BCE visit of emissaries, it was noted that the Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal [22]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 6th–5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms [22] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends [39]\n\n\nAncient history and settlement\nIn the 6th–5th century BCE, the Maldives already had their kingdoms [22] The country has an established history of over 2,500 years according to historical evidence and legends [39]\n\n\nBuddhist period\nDespite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400 year-long Buddhist period has a foundational importance in the history of the Maldives It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture that survives today The Maldivian language, early Maldive scripts, architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom [45]\n\n\nIslamic period\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of the Maldives, Dhovemi, converted to Islam in the year 1153 (or 1193) Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al-Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness.\n\n\nProtectorate period\nIn 1558, the Portuguese established a small garrison with a Viador (Viyazoaru), or overseer of a factory (trading post) in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in Goa Their attempts to forcefully impose Christianity with the threat of death provoked a local revolt led by Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'uẓam, his two brothers and Dhuvaafaru Dhandahele, who fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of the Maldives This event is now commemorated as National Day which is known as Qaumee Dhuvas (literally meaning \"National\" and \"Day\") It is celebrated on 1st of Rabi' al-Awwal, the third month of Hijri (Islamic) calendar.\n\n\nIndependence and republic\nWhen the British became increasingly unable to continue their colonial hold on Asia and were losing their colonies to the indigenous populations who wanted freedom, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which formally ended the British authority on the defence and external affairs of the Maldives [60] The islands thus achieved independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Colombo After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi, who declared himself King upon independence [61]\n\n\n21st century\nThe Maldives were devastated by a tsunami on 26 December 2004, following the Indian Ocean earthquake Only nine islands were reported to have escaped any flooding, [73] [74] while fifty-seven islands faced serious damage to critical infrastructure, fourteen islands had to be totally evacuated, and six islands were destroyed A further twenty-one resort islands were forced to close because of tsunami damage The total damage was estimated at more than US$400 million, or some 62% of the GDP [75] 102 Maldivians and 6 foreigners reportedly died in the tsunami [70] The destructive impact of the waves on the low-lying islands was mitigated by the fact there was no continental shelf or land mass upon which the waves could gain height The tallest waves were reported to be 14 feet (4.3 m) high [76]\n\n\nGeography\nThe Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls, that stretch along a length of 871 kilometres (541 miles) north to south, 130 kilometres (81 miles) east to west, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi), of which only 298 km2 (115 sq mi) is dry land, making this one of the world's most dispersed countries It lies between latitudes 1°S and 8°N, and longitudes 72° and 74°E The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submarine ridge 960 kilometres (600 mi) long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification, which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon Two seasons dominate the Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms [97]\n\n\nSea level rise\nIn 1988, Maldivian authorities claimed that sea rise would \"completely cover this Indian Ocean nation of 1,196 small islands within the next 30 years.\" [101]\n\n\nEnvironment\nEnvironmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste disposal and sand theft Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little litter can be found on the islands, most waste disposal sites are often substandard The bulk of the waste from Malé and nearby resorts in the Maldives are disposed of at Thilafushi, an industrial island on top of a lagoon reclaimed in the early '90s to sort waste management issues which had plagued the capital and surrounding islands [112]\n\n\nMarine ecosystem\nThe Maldives have a range of different habitats including deep sea, shallow coast, and reef ecosystems, fringing mangroves, wetlands and dry land There are 187 species of coral forming the coral reefs This area of the Indian Ocean, alone, houses 1,100 species of fish, 5 species of sea turtle, 21 species of whale and dolphin, 400 species of mollusc, and 83 species of echinoderms The area is also populated by a number of crustacean species: 120 copepods, 15 amphipods, as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species [114]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe wildlife of the Maldives includes the flora and fauna of the islands, reefs, and the surrounding ocean Recent scientific studies suggest that the fauna varies greatly between atolls following a north–south gradient, but important differences between neighbouring atolls were also found (especially in terms of sea animals), which may be linked to differences in fishing pressure — including poaching [121]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Maldives is a presidential constitutional republic, with extensive influence of the president as head of government and head of state The president heads the executive branch, and appoints the cabinet which is approved by the People's Majlis (Parliament) He leads the armed forces The current president serving since 17 November 2023 is Mohamed Muizzu [128] [129] President of the Maldives and Members of the unicameral Majlis serve five-year terms [130] The total number of members are determined by atoll populations At the 2024 parliamentary election, the People's National Congress (PNC) won a super-majority over the 93 constituencies [131]\n\n\nLaw\nAccording to the Constitution of Maldives, \"the judges are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and the law When deciding matters on which the Constitution or the law is silent, judges must consider Islamic Shari'ah\" [139]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSince 1996, the Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the Indian Ocean Commission In 2002, the Maldives began to express interest in the commission but as of 2008 [update] had not applied for membership Maldives' interest relates to its identity as a small island state, especially economic development and environmental preservation, and its desire for closer relations with France, a main actor in the IOC region.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Maldives National Defence Force is the combined security organisation responsible for defending the security and sovereignty of the Maldives, having the primary task of being responsible for attending to all internal and external security needs of the Maldives, including the protection of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the maintenance of peace and security [157] The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps, Defence Intelligence Service, Military Police, Corps of Engineers, Special Protection Group, Medical Corps, Adjutant General's Corps, Air Corps, and Fire and Rescue Service The Maldives has an arrangement with India allowing cooperation on radar coverage.\n\n\nHuman rights\nHuman rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue In its 2011 Freedom in the World report, Freedom House declared the Maldives \"Partly Free\", claiming a reform process which had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled [159] The United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption, lack of religious freedom, abuse, and unequal treatment of women [160]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe Maldives has twenty-six natural atolls and few island groups on isolated reefs, all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (17 administrative atolls and cities of Malé, Addu, Fuvahmulah, Thinadhoo, and Kulhudhuffushi) [161]\n\n\nEconomy\nHistorically, the Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells, an international currency of the early ages From the 2nd century CE, the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs [163] Monetaria moneta were used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of Maldivian cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade [164] The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority.\n\n\nTourism\nThe Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s Only 200 islands are home to its 382,751 inhabitants [167] [168] The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.\n\n\nVisitors\nVisitors to the Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival, regardless of their country of origin, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country [174]\n\n\nFishing industry\nFor many centuries the Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on fishing and other marine products Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe largest ethnic group is Dhivehin, i.e the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of Minicoy in Union territory of Lakshadweep, India They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language They are principally an Indo-Aryan people, having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, Austronesian and African genes in the population.\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in the Maldives [2]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official and national language is Dhivehi, an Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhala language of Sri Lanka The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the eveyla akuru script, which is found in the historical recording of kings (raadhavalhi) Later a script called Dhives akuru was used for a long period The present-day script is called Thaana and is written from right to left Thaana is derived from a mix of the old indigenous script of Dhives akuru and Arabic abjad Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of Mohamed Thakurufaanu.\n\n\nPopulation by locality\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative reports that Maldives is meeting 5.1 of 10 of the expected fulfillment for the right to health considering its income level [192] Specifically for children's health rights, Maldives attains 98.0% of the anticipated level based on its current income [192]  Regarding adult health rights, the country achieves 99.7% of the expected fulfillment considering its income level However, in terms of reproductive health rights, Maldives falls into the \"very bad\" category, as it fulfills only 18.2% of the expected achievement based on its available resources [193]\n\n\nHealth\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative reports that Maldives is meeting 5.1 of 10 of the expected fulfillment for the right to health considering its income level [192] Specifically for children's health rights, Maldives attains 98.0% of the anticipated level

Maldives falls into the \"very bad\" category, as it fulfills only 18.2% of the expected achievement based on its available resources [193]\n\n\nTransportation\nVelana International Airport is the principal gateway to the Maldives; it is adjacent to the capital city Malé and is connected by a bridge International travel is available on government-owned Island Aviation Services (branded as Maldivian), which operates DHC-6 Twin Otter seaplanes and to nearly all Maldivian domestic airports with several Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft, and one Airbus A320 with international service to India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\n\nEducation\nThe Maldives National University is one of the country's institutions of higher education [f] [201] In 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health [202] The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades [203] In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry [204]  In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999 In 2000 the college launched its first-degree programme, Bachelor of Arts On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011 In 2015 under a Presidential decree the College of Islamic Studies was changed into the Islamic University of Maldives (IUM) [205]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of the Maldives is influenced by the cultures of the people of different ethnicities who have settled on the islands throughout the times.\n\n\nMedia\nPSM News serves as the country's main media, owned by the government of the Maldives [209] The newspaper was founded on 3 May 2017, in the celebration of World Press Freedom Day [210] Maldives has been ranked one–hundred in the World Press Freedom Index 2023 and 106 in 2024 [211] The country's first daily newspaper, Haveeru Daily News was the first and longest–serving newspaper in the history of the Maldives, which was registered on 28 December 1978, and dissolved in 2016 [212]\nArticle 28 of the Maldives Constitution guarantees freedom of the press and stipulates that:\n\n\nSports\nSports in the Maldives are deeply ingrained in the culture of the island nation, with a diverse array of activities reflecting both traditional pastimes and modern sporting pursuits Given its unique geography of scattered islands surrounded by the Indian Ocean, water sports naturally hold a prominent position Surfing, in particular, has gained international recognition, with waves that cater to both beginners and seasoned surfers Locations such as the atolls of North and South Malé, Thulusdhoo, and Himmafushi offer ideal conditions for enthusiasts to ride the waves throughout the years [215] Additionally, diving and snorkeling are immensely popular, allowing locals and tourists alike to explore the rich marine life that thrives in the crystal-clear waters

His life has been marked by a combination of athletic achievement and personal struggle.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAaron Brink was born on November 12, 1974, in Newport Beach, California. Growing up in Huntington Beach, he was raised by his blue-collar father who instilled in him a strong work ethic and a passion for sports. Brink developed a particular interest in wrestling and surfing, spending countless hours honing his skills in these disciplines.\n\nAs a teenager, Brink attended Huntington High School, but his academic and athletic career was marked by disruption. He was expelled from the school for fighting, a behavior that would continue to plague him throughout his life. Between 1989 and 1992, Brink found himself in and out of juvenile detention centers on eight occasions, struggling to find stability and direction.\n\nCareer\n\nDespite his tumultuous youth, Brink eventually found a new path in life through mixed martial arts. After being released from prison, he connected with an old friend who encouraged him to enter the sport.

He competed for the Gladiator Challenge promotion, where he held the title of Interim Heavyweight Champion. Brink also fought for the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, a sanctioning body that governs the sport of bare knuckle boxing.\n\nIn his later years, Brink transitioned to competing in bare knuckle boxing, a sport that involves fighting without gloves. This decision was likely driven by a desire to test himself in a new and more challenging environment, as well as to capitalize on the growing popularity of the sport.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n\nBrink's personal life has been marked by significant turmoil. In 1999, he married Laura Voepel, the daughter of California politician Randy Voepel. However, the marriage was short-lived, and the couple divorced in 2001.\n\nBrink has also struggled with a long-term addiction to methamphetamine, a substance that has had a devastating impact on his life and career. This addiction has likely contributed to his tumultuous personal history and has had a significant impact on his relationships and overall well-being.\n\nSelect Appearances\n\nThroughout his career, Brink has appeared in a variety of mixed martial arts and bare knuckle boxing events.

The missile has a solid-fuel booster rocket and a jet engine, providing it with a maximum range of approximately 300 kilometers. The Neptune has been used in combat by Russian forces during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe R-360 Neptune was first revealed at the 2015 Arms and Security international exhibition in Kyiv. The missile was designed to be a modern and effective anti-ship weapon, capable of engaging high-speed targets at long range. The Neptune was developed by the Ukrainian company Luch Design Bureau, which is a leading manufacturer of missile systems in Ukraine.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nThe R-360 Neptune has seen combat use by Russian forces during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. On April 3, 2022, Ukrainian sources claimed that the Russian frigate Admiral Essen had been damaged by Ukrainian forces. Later, Oleksiy Arestovych, a freelance adviser to the Office of the President of Ukraine, clarified that Admiral Essen had been hit by a Neptune missile. The Russians did not comment on the claim, and the ship continued its mission as normal.\n\nThe use of the Neptune in combat has provided valuable insights into its capabilities and limitations. The missile's ability to engage high-speed targets at long range has made it a valuable asset for Russian forces. However, the Neptune's vulnerability to electronic countermeasures and its relatively slow speed have been identified as potential weaknesses.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe R-360 Neptune uses a solid-fuel booster rocket to launch it into the air. After the fuel is expended, the rocket stage falls away, and the jet engine takes over, providing the necessary thrust. The Neptune has a cross-shaped hard wing, which provides stability and control during flight. The missile is designed to be housed in transport and launch containers with dimensions 5.3 by 0.6 by 0.6 meters.\n\nA single Neptune missile, including the rocket motor, is 5.05 meters in length and weighs 870 kilograms. Of this weight, 150 kilograms is the warhead. The Neptune uses a Motor Sich MS400 engine, which has a high thrust-to-weight ratio. This engine provides the necessary power to propel the missile to its maximum speed.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n* Length: 5.05 meters\n* Diameter: 0.6 meters\n* Weight: 870 kilograms\n* Warhead weight: 150 kilograms\n* Range: approximately 300 kilometers\n* Speed: subsonic\n* Engine: Motor Sich MS400\n* Fuel: solid-fuel booster rocket and jet fuel\n* Guidance: inertial guidance and terrain-following radar\n\n**Comparison with Other Subsonic Anti-Ship Missiles**\n\nThe R-360 Neptune is one of several subsonic anti-ship missiles used by various countries around the world. Other notable examples include the Russian P-800 Oniks, the Chinese YJ-12, and the US Harpoon. Each of these missiles has its own unique characteristics and capabilities.\n\nThe P-800 Oniks is a Russian subsonic anti-ship missile with a range of approximately 300 kilometers. The Oniks uses a solid-fuel booster rocket and a jet engine, similar to the Neptune. The Oniks has a higher speed than the Neptune, but its range is similar.\n\nThe YJ-12 is a Chinese subsonic anti-ship missile with a range of approximately 290 kilometers. The YJ-12 uses a liquid-fuel engine and has a higher speed than the Neptune. The YJ-12 also has a more advanced guidance system, using a combination of inertial and terrain-following radar.\n\nThe Harpoon is a US subsonic anti-ship missile with a range of approximately 130 kilometers. The Harpoon uses a solid-fuel booster rocket and a jet engine, similar to the Neptune. The Harpoon has a lower speed than the Neptune, but its range is shorter.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n[Insert images of the R-360 Neptune]\n\n**See Also**\n\n* P-800 Oniks\n* YJ-12\n* Harpoon\n* Subsonic anti-ship missiles\n\n**References**\n\n[Insert references]\n\n**External Links**\n\n[Insert external links]\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and includes a neutral, encyclopedic tone.

published nine years earlier in 1894 Sinclair was the editor of the Cactus yearbook, a UT band member, and a member of the Glee Club, and he wrote the lyrics per the request of band member Lewis Johnson Johnson was also the program director of the Varsity Minstrel Show that raised funds for the university track team.\n\n\nLyrics\nThe lyrics are set to the tune of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad\" A comparison of the lyrics of that song and \"The Eyes of Texas\" shows the nature of the parody in the latter:\n\n\nUsage in popular culture\nThe song was sung each morning by school children in Castro County, Texas at the Hart Elementary and the Dimmett High School every morning before classes after the Pledge of Allegiance  This was as early as 1926 to 1938, according to a student, Joe Erwin Stewart, who attended between those dates.\n\n\nAppearances in film\nThe lyrics of the song have been interpreted as embracing the \"Lost Cause\" ideology, which advocates the belief that the practice of slavery in the Antebellum South was just and moral [11] [12] This interpretation was based on a tradition that held that UT President William Prather had adapted the phrase from General Robert E Lee's purported use of the phrase \"The eyes of the South are upon you\" to advocate Lost Cause nostalgia [11] [13] Prather had attended Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, whose president was Robert E Lee All of these interpretations predate research from a report that \nfound \"no primary source has been found connecting the phrase as something that Lee used\" and additionally found no evidence in Washington & Lee University records \"that Lee ever closed an address to the students with the phrase\" [14] However, a report by UT Austin history professor Alberto Martinez states that President William Prather's use of the phrase was inspired by a line spoken by confederate general Maxcy Gregg about Robert E Lee While no primary source \"has been found connecting the phrase as something that Lee used\", four independent secondary accounts, by both of William Prather's children, T.U Taylor (who recounted the story multiple times in the decades before his 1938 memoir), and Jim Cannon have all stated that Prather's inspiration for the phrase was General Robert E Lee [15]  The phrase \"The Eyes of Texas\" was in use well before the Civil War with regard to Texas itself  In a column entitled \"A Campfire Story\" in the Highland Messenger of May 26, 1843, a report on early military discipline in Texas shortly after the Battle of

University of Texas at Austin's band, to the tune of the classic folk song \"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\" The song became an unofficial anthem of the University of Texas and has been sung by students, alumni, and fans for generations.\n\n**History**\n\nThe song was written by John Sinclair, who was the editor of the Cactus yearbook, a UT band member, and a member of the Glee Club. He wrote the lyrics per the request of band member Lewis Johnson, who was also the program director of the Varsity Minstrel Show, a fundraiser for the university track team. The song was first performed by the UT band in 1903 and quickly became a popular tune among students and alumni.\n\n## Early Performances\n\nThe song was sung by students, faculty, and alumni at various university events, including football games, concerts, and commencements. It was also performed by the UT band at various state and national events, including the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n## Usage in Popular Culture\n\nThe song was sung by students at Castro County's Hart Elementary and Dimmett High School every morning from 1926 to 1938, according to a student, Joe Erwin Stewart, who attended between those dates. The song was also sung by students and alumni at various other universities and colleges across the United States.\n\n## Appearances in Film\n\nThe lyrics of the song have been interpreted as embracing the \"Lost Cause\" ideology, which advocates the belief that the practice of slavery in the Antebellum South was just and moral.

It has also been performed by various artists, including country music stars and jazz musicians.\n\n## Appearances in Other Songs\n\nThe song has been referenced and parodied in various other songs, including country music and folk songs. It has also been used as a basis for other musical compositions, including instrumental pieces and choral arrangements.\n\n## Controversy\n\nThe song has been the subject of controversy due to its association with the \"Lost Cause\" ideology, which has been criticized for its perceived glorification of slavery and racism. Some have argued that the song's lyrics are ambiguous and open to interpretation, while others have argued that the song's history and context make it clear that it is a celebration of Texas history and culture.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe song's lyrics have been translated into various languages, including Spanish and French. It has also been adapted into various musical arrangements, including orchestral and choral versions.\n\n## External Links\n\n* The University of Texas at Austin's official website has a page

Sikh family [8] His mother died when he was very young [9] [10] His paternal grandmother raised him, and he was very close to her [10] His early schooling was in the Urdu medium, and even as prime minister years later, he wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to write Punjabi, his mother tongue.\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter completing his D.Phil., Singh returned to India He was a senior lecturer of economics at Panjab University from 1957 to 1959 During 1959 and 1963, he served as a reader in economics at Panjab University, and from 1963 to 1965, he was an economics professor there [19] Then he went to work for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1966 to 1969 [15] Later, he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Trade by Lalit Narayan Mishra, in recognition of Singh's talent as an economist [20]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn June 1991, India's prime minister at the time, P V Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be his finance minister Singh told Mark Tully a British journalist in 2005: \n\n\nMinister of Finance\nIn 1991, India's fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the balance of payments deficit was huge and the current account deficit was close to 3.5 per cent of India's GDP [23] India's foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1 billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports, [24] in comparison to US$600 billion in 2009 [25]\n\n\nLeader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha\nSingh was first elected to the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1991 [29] by the legislature of the state of Assam, and was re-elected in 1995, 2001, 2007 [8] and 2013 [30] From 1998 to 2004, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha In 1999, he contested for the Lok Sabha from South Delhi but was unable to win the seat [31]\n\n\nPrime minister\nAfter the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha It formed United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with allies and staked claim to form government In a surprise move, Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a technocrat, as the UPA candidate for the prime ministership Despite the fact that Singh had never won a direct popular election, according to the BBC, he \"enjoyed massive popular support, not least because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations.\" [32] He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004 [33] [34]\n\n\nFirst term: 2004–2009\nAfter the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha It formed United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with allies and staked claim to form government In a surprise move, Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a

because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations.\" [32] He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004 [33] [34]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nIn 1991, Singh, as Finance Minister, abolished the Licence Raj, source of slow economic growth and corruption in the Indian economy for decades He liberalised the Indian economy, allowing it to speed up development dramatically During his term as prime minister, Singh continued to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying widespread success in these matters Singh, along with his finance minister, P Chidambaram, presided over a period where the Indian economy grew with an 8–9% economic growth rate In 2007, India achieved its highest GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second fastest growing major economy in the world [35] [36] Singh's ministry enacted a National Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005.\n\n\nHealthcare and education\nIn 2005, Prime Minister Singh and his government's health ministry started the National Rural Health Mission (NHRM), which mobilised half a million community health workers This rural health initiative was praised by the American economist Jeffrey Sachs [41] In 2006, his Government implemented the proposal to reserve 27% of seats in All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central institutions of higher education for Other Backward Classes which led to 2006 Indian anti-reservation protests.\n\n\nSecurity and Home Affairs\nSingh's government strengthened anti-terror laws with amendments to Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also created soon after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, as need for a central agency to combat terrorism was realised Also, Unique Identification Authority of India was established in February 2009, an agency responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card with the objective of increasing national security and facilitating e-governance.\n\n\nNotable legislation\nThe important National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Information Act were passed by the Parliament in 2005 during his tenure While the effectiveness of the NREGA has been successful at various degrees, in various regions, the RTI act has proved crucial in India's fight against corruption [45] New cash benefits were also introduced for widows, pregnant women, and landless persons [46] [47]\n\n\nForeign policy\nManmohan Singh continued the pragmatic foreign policy that was started by P.V Narasimha Rao and continued by Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee Singh continued the peace process with Pakistan initiated by his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Exchange of high-level visits by top leaders from both countries have highlighted his tenure Efforts have been made during Singh's tenure to end the border dispute with People's Republic of China In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India which was followed by Singh's visit to Beijing in January 2008 A major development in Sino-Indian relations was the reopening of the Nathula Pass in 2006 after being closed for more than four decades [56] Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Keqiang paid a state visit to India (Delhi-Mumbai) from 19 to 21 May 2013 [56] Singh paid an official visit to China from 22 to 24 October 2013 [56] Three agreements were signed establishing sister-city partnership between Delhi-Beijing, Kolkata-Kunming and Bangalore-Chengdu As of 2010, the People's Republic of China was the second biggest trade partner of India [57]\n\n\nSecond term: 2009–2014\nIndia held general elections to the 15th Lok Sabha in five phases between 16 April 2009 and 13 May 2009 The results of the election were announced on 16 May 2009 [68] Strong showing in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh helped the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) form the new government under the incumbent Singh, who became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to win re-election after completing a full five-year term [69] The Congress and its allies were able to put together a

He was born Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch in the small town of Slatinské Doly, in the region of Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia (now Solotvyno, Ukraine) on 10 June 1923. Maxwell's early life and upbringing would have a significant impact on his later career and business dealings.\n\n## Early Life\n\nLike the rest of the then-newly formed Czechoslovakia, the area of Maxwell's birth and upbringing had been part of the Austria-Hungary until early November 1918. The area was annexed by Hungary in 1939, and Maxwell's Jewish heritage would later influence his relationships with various governments and intelligence agencies. Maxwell's family was Orthodox Jewish, and he was the youngest of five children. His father, Heršl, was a successful businessman who owned a small textile mill.\n\nMaxwell's early education took place in his hometown, where he excelled in mathematics and languages. He later moved to Prague to attend the Jewish Gymnasium, where he developed a strong interest in politics and economics. After completing his secondary education, Maxwell moved to London to study at the University of Birmingham, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics.\n\n## Pergamon Press\n\nMaxwell's entry into the publishing industry began in the 1950s, when he founded Pergamon Press, a publishing company that specialized in scientific and technical books. The company quickly gained a reputation for producing high-quality publications, and Maxwell became a prominent figure in the British publishing industry. In 1969, Saul Steinberg, head of Leasco Data Processing Corporation, was interested in a strategic acquisition of Pergamon Press. Steinberg claimed that during negotiations, Maxwell falsely stated that a subsidiary responsible for publishing encyclopedias was extremely profitable. However, Pergamon had been forced to reduce its profit forecasts for 1969 from £2.5 million to £2.05 million during the period of negotiations, and dealing in Pergamon shares was suspended on the London stock markets.\n\n## Later Business Activities\n\nIn July 1984, Maxwell acquired Mirror Group Newspapers, the publisher of six British newspapers, including the Daily Mirror, from Reed International plc for £113 million. This led to a media war between Maxwell and Murdoch, the proprietor of the News of the World and The Sun. Maxwell's acquisition of Mirror Group Newspapers marked a significant expansion of his media empire, and he became one of the most influential media moguls in the United Kingdom.\n\nMaxwell's business dealings were marked by controversy and allegations of financial mismanagement. In 1987, Maxwell was accused of using company funds to purchase a yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, and of making large loans to his family members. Maxwell's sons, Kevin and Ian, were involved in various business ventures with their father, including the acquisition of a number of publishing companies.\n\n## Israeli Support\n\nA hint of Maxwell's service to Israel was provided by John Loftus and Mark Aarons, who described Maxwell's contacts with Czechoslovak communist leaders in 1948 as crucial to the Czechoslovak decision to arm Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Czechoslovak military assistance was both unique and crucial for Israel in the conflict. According to Loftus and Aarons, it was Maxwell's covert help in smuggling aircraft parts into Israel that led to the country having air supremacy during the war.\n\n## Distribution of PROMIS Software\n\nMaxwell is alleged to have distributed a bugged version of a software, PROMIS, to a plethora of national governments and global financial institutions that enabled mass spying by the government of Israel. PROMIS was a powerful software tool that allowed users to track and manage large amounts of data. The software was developed by a company called Inslaw, which was founded by a lawyer named Bill Hamilton.\n\n## Mossad Allegations; Vanunu Case\n\nThe Foreign Office suspected Maxwell of being a secret agent of a foreign government, possibly a double agent or a triple agent, and \"a thoroughly bad character and almost certainly financed by Russia.\" He had known links to the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), to the Soviet KGB, and to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. Six serving and former heads of Israeli intelligence services attended Maxwell's funeral in Israel, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir eulogized him and stated: \"He has done more for Israel than can today be told.\"\n\n## Death\n\nOn 4 November 1991, Maxwell had an argumentative phone call with his son Kevin over a meeting scheduled with the Bank of England on Maxwell's default on £50 million in loans. Maxwell missed the meeting, instead traveling on his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, to the Canary Islands, Spain. On 5 November, Maxwell was last in contact with the crew of Lady Ghislaine at 4:25 a.m local time, but was found to be missing later in the morning. Maxwell's naked body was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean and taken to Las Palmas. Besides a \"graze to his left shoulder,\" there were no noticeable wounds on Maxwell's body.\n\n## Aftermath of Maxwell's Death\n\nMaxwell's death triggered instability for his publishing empire, with banks frantically calling in their massive loans. Despite the efforts of his sons Kevin and Ian, the Maxwell companies soon collapsed. It emerged that, without adequate prior authorization, Maxwell had used hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies' pension funds to shore up the shares of the Mirror Group to save his companies from bankruptcy. Eventually, the pension funds were replenished with money from investment banks Lehman Brothers, Coopers & Lybrand, and Goldman Sachs, as well as the British government.\n\n## Family\n\nIn November 1994, Maxwell's widow Elisabeth published her memoirs, A Mind of My Own: My Life with Robert Maxwell. Elisabeth devoted much of her later life to continued research on the Holocaust and worked as a proponent of Jewish-Christian dialogue. She died on 7 August 2013.\n\n## In Popular Culture\n\nMaxwell's life and business dealings have been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. The 1992 film \"The Man Who Owned Britain\" was a biographical drama that explored Maxwell's rise to power and his subsequent fall. The 2006 film \"The Deal\" was a drama that starred Miranda Richardson as Elisabeth Maxwell and explored the couple's relationship and the events leading up to Maxwell's death.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Pergamon Press\n* Mirror Group Newspapers\n* Robert Maxwell's death\n* PROMIS software\n* Israeli intelligence service Mossad\n\n## Notes\n\n* Maxwell's business dealings were marked by controversy and allegations of financial mismanagement.\n* Maxwell's ties to various governments and intelligence agencies, including the Israeli Mossad, have been the subject of much speculation and debate.\n* Maxwell's death in 1991 led to the collapse of his publishing empire and the loss of millions of pounds.\n\n## References\n\n* \"The Man Who Owned Britain\" by Tom Bower (1987)\n* \"Robert Maxwell: Biography\" by Elisabeth Maxwell (1994)\n* \"The Deal\" by Jane MacKenzie (2006)\n* \"The Maxwell Affair\" by John Loftus and Mark Aarons (1990)\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* \"The Rise and Fall of Robert Maxwell\" by Tom Bower (1987)\n* \"The Maxwell Mysteries\" by John Loftus and Mark Aarons (1990)\n* \"The Pergamon Press Affair\" by Saul Steinberg (1970)\n* \"The Mirror Group Newspapers Scandal\" by Kevin Maxwell (1994)\n\n## External Links\n\n* Robert Maxwell at the Internet Movie Database\n* Robert Maxwell: A Biography at Goodreads\n* The Maxwell Affair at The Guardian\n* The Robert Maxwell Archives at the British Library.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Robert_Maxwell\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRobert Maxwell was born Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch in the small town of Slatinské Doly, in the region of Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia (now Solotvyno, Ukraine) on 10 June 1923 [4] [5] [6] Like the rest of the then-newly formed Czechoslovakia, the area of Maxwell's birth and upbringing had been part of the Austria-Hungary until early November 1918 The area was annexed by Hungary in 1939.\n\n\nPergamon lost and regained\nIn 1969, Saul Steinberg, head of \"Leasco Data Processing Corporation\", was interested in a strategic acquisition of Pergamon Press Steinberg claimed that during negotiations, Maxwell falsely stated that a subsidiary responsible for publishing encyclopedias was extremely profitable [23] [24] At the same time, Pergamon had been forced to reduce its profit forecasts for 1969 from £2.5 million to £2.05 million during the period of negotiations, and dealing in Pergamon shares was suspended on the London stock markets [24]\n\n\nLater business activities\nIn July 1984, Maxwell acquired Mirror Group Newspapers, the publisher of six British newspapers, including the Daily Mirror, from Reed International plc [30] for £113 million [31] This led to a media war between Maxwell and Murdoch, the proprietor of the News of the World and The Sun Mirror Group Newspapers (formerly Trinity Mirror, now part of Reach plc), published the Daily Mirror, a pro-Labour tabloid;

{"title": "Richard_Nixon", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nRichard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, in what was then the township precinct of Yorba Linda, California, [2] in a house built by his father, on his family's lemon ranch [1] [3] [4] His parents were Francis A Nixon and Hannah (Milhous) Nixon His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith Through his mother, Nixon was a descendant of the early English settler Thomas Cornell [5]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nNixon attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class [15] His older brother Harold had attended Whittier High School, which his parents thought resulted in Harold's dissolute lifestyle, before he contracted tuberculosis (that killed him in 1933) They decided to send Nixon to the larger Fullerton Union High School [16] [17] Though he had to ride a school bus an hour each way during his freshman year, he attained excellent grades Later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week [18] He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, though he rarely was used in games [19] He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H Lynn Sheller Nixon later mused on Sheller's words, \"Remember, speaking is conversation...don't shout at people Talk to them Converse with them.\" [20] Nixon said he tried to use a conversational tone as much as possible [20]\n\n\nCollege and law school\nNixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but with Harold's continued illness requiring his mother's care, Richard was needed at the store He remained in his hometown, and enrolled at Whittier College in September 1930 His expenses were met by his maternal grandfather [1] [22] Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football, and though he lacked the size to play, he remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm [23] Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins, many of whom were from prominent families, unlike Nixon He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society [24] In addition to the society, his studies, and work at the store, Nixon engaged in several extracurricular activities; he was a champion debater and hard worker [25] In 1933, he was engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief, but they broke up in 1935 [26]\n\n\nEarly career and marriage\nAfter graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join the FBI He received no response to his letter of application, and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts [33] He was admitted to the California bar in 1937, and began practicing in Whittier with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in the National Bank of Whittier Building [27] [34]  His work concentrated on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills [35] Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women [36] In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California, [37] and became a full partner in the firm the following year [38] In later years, Nixon proudly said he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney [36]  During this period, Nixon was also the president of the Citra-Frost Company, which attempted to produce and sell frozen orange juice, but the company went bankrupt after just 18 months [39] [40]\n\n\nMilitary service\nIn January 1942, the couple moved to the Northern Virginia suburbs, where Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration in Washington, D.C [27] [45] In his political campaigns, Nixon suggested that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941 Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier [46] He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence He did not enjoy the role, and four months later applied to join the United States Navy [47] Though he could have claimed an exemption from the draft as a birthright Quaker, or a deferral due to his government service, Nixon nevertheless sought a commission in the Navy His application was approved, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the United States Naval Reserve on June 15, 1942 [48] [49]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1947–1950)\nRepublicans in California's 12th congressional district were frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic representative Jerry Voorhis, and they sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him In 1945, they formed a \"Committee of 100\" to decide on a candidate, hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to previous Voorhis victories After the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, Herman Perry, manager of Whittier's Bank of America branch, suggested Nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on Whittier College's board of trustees before the war Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore, and after a night of excited conversation with his wife, Nixon gave Perry an enthused response, [58] [59] confirming that he was registered to vote in California at his parents' Whittier residence [60] Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee When he left the Navy at the start of 1946, Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier, where he began a year of intensive campaigning [58] [59] He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a representative and suggested that Voorhis's endorsement by a group linked to Communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views [61] Nixon won the election, receiving 65,586 votes to Voorhis's 49,994 [62]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1950–1953)\nIn 1949, Nixon began to consider running for the United States Senate against the Democratic incumbent, Sheridan Downey, [74] and entered the race in November [75] Downey, faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, announced his retirement in March 1950 [76] Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections [77] and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue [78] Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas's liberal voting record As part of that effort, a \"Pink Sheet\" was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that Douglas's voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, reputed to be a communist, and their political views must be nearly identical [79] Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points [80] During the campaign, Nixon was first called \"Tricky Dick\" by his opponents for his campaign tactics [81]\n\n\nVice presidency (1953–1961)\nGeneral Dwight D Eisenhower was nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952 He had no strong preference for a vice-presidential candidate, and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a \"smoke-filled room\" and recommended Nixon to the general, who agreed to the senator's selection Nixon's youth (he was then 39), stance against communism, and political base in California—one of the largest states—were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Senator Robert A Taft of Ohio, Governor Alfred Driscoll of New Jersey, and Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois [85] [86] On the campaign trail, Eisenhower spoke of his plans for the country, and left the negative campaigning to his running mate [87]\n\n\n1960 presidential campaign\nIn 1960, Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States, officially announcing on January 9, 1960 [111] He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries [112] and chose former Massachusetts senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr as his running mate [113] His Democratic opponent was John F Kennedy and the race remained close for the duration [114] Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower–Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S in quantity and quality of ballistic missiles [115] While Kennedy faced issues about his Catholicism, Nixon remained a divisive figure to some [116]\n\n\n1962 California gubernatorial campaign\nLocal and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for governor of California in the 1962 gubernatorial election [113] Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race [113] The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor [113] Nixon hoped a successful run would confirm his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics [120] Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career [113]\n\n\nWilderness years\nIn 1963 the Nixon family traveled to Europe, where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited [124] The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander [113] When announcing his California campaign, Nixon had pledged not to run for president in 1964; even if he had not, he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson [125]\n\n\n1968 presidential campaign\nAt the end of 1967, Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life, [134] being embarrassed, for example, by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech [135] She still managed to be supportive of her husband's ambitions Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960 [134]\n\n\nPresidency (1969–1974)\nNixon was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1969, sworn in by his onetime political rival, Chief Justice Earl Warren Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at Isaiah 2:4, which reads, \"They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.\" In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that \"the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker\" [150]—a phrase that found a place on his gravestone [151] He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity:\n\n\nForeign policy\nNixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: \"There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.\" [153] Among the reasons that Nixon sought to improve relations with China was in the hope of weakening the Soviet Union and decreasing China's support to the North in the Vietnam War [154] Nixon ultimately used the idea of gaining leverage against the Soviet Union through relations with China to obtain the support of key conservative figures including Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan [155]\n\n\nChina\nNixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: \"There is no

to obtain the support of key conservative figures including Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan [155]\n\n\nVietnam War\nWhen Nixon took office, about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam, [164] and the war was widely unpopular in the United States, the subject of ongoing violent protests The Johnson administration had offered to suspend bombing unconditionally in exchange for negotiations, but to no avail According to Walter Isaacson, Nixon concluded soon after taking office that the Vietnam War could not be won, and he was determined to end it quickly [165] He sought an arrangement that would permit American forces to withdraw while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack [166]\n\n\nLatin American policy\nNixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy during the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis On taking office in 1969, he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro The Soviets and Cubans became concerned, fearing Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev that ended the missile crisis In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding, which he did, despite his hard line against Castro The process was not completed before the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970 A minor confrontation ensued, the Soviets stipulated they would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles, and the final round of diplomatic notes were exchanged in November [183]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nNixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972, and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, among other leading Soviet officials [186]\n\n\nMiddle Eastern policy\n\n\n\nDomestic policy\nAt the time Nixon took office in 1969, inflation was at 4.7 percent—its highest rate since the Korean War The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century [203] Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war [203] This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency) [204] According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency [205]\n\n\nEconomy\nAt the time Nixon took office in 1969, inflation was at 4.7 percent—its highest rate since the Korean War The Great Society had

political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency [205]\n\n\nGovernmental initiatives and organization\nNixon advocated a \"New Federalism\", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them [210] He eliminated the Cabinet-level United States Post Office Department, which in 1971 became the government-run United States Postal Service [211]\n\n\nCivil rights\nThe Nixon presidency witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South [223] Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites [224] Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use [225]\n\n\nSpace policy\nAfter a nearly decade-long national effort, the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11 Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their moonwalk He called the conversation \"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House\" [232]\n\n\nReelection, Watergate scandal, and resignation\nNixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment The Democratic \"Solid South\" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy Through his first term, he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights movement He nominated two Southern conservatives, Clement Haynsworth and G Harrold Carswell, to the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate [237]\n\n\n1972 presidential campaign\nNixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political

Southern conservatives, Clement Haynsworth and G Harrold Carswell, to the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate [237]\n\n\nWatergate\nThe term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration Those activities included \"dirty tricks\", such as bugging the offices of political opponents, and the harassment of activist groups and political figures The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into the Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972 The Washington Post picked up on the story; reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as \"Deep Throat\"—later revealed to be Mark Felt, associate director at the FBI—to link the men to the Nixon administration Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, and later the White House, were involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing [139] [247] [248]\n\n\nResignation\nIn light of his loss of political support and the near-certainty that he would be impeached and removed from office, Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, after addressing the nation on television the previous evening [250] The resignation speech was delivered from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television Nixon said he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, Gerald Ford Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency, especially in foreign policy [260] He defended his record as president, quoting from Theodore Roosevelt's 1910 speech Citizenship in a Republic:\n\n\nPost-presidency (1974–1994)\nFollowing his resignation, the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, California [264] According to his biographer, Jonathan Aitken, \"Nixon was a soul in torment\" after his resignation [265] Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses, though reducing the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000 With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7:00 a.m with little to do [265] His former press secretary, Ron Ziegler, sat with him alone for hours each day [266]\n\n\nPardon and illness\nFollowing his resignation,

considerable ill will against him in the country He wrote in his diary, referring to himself and Pat,\n\n\nAuthor and elder statesman\nIn 1978, Nixon published his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, the first of nine books he was to author in his retirement [264] John A Farrell deemed it one of the better presidential memoirs, candid and capturing its author's voice; he deemed its rise up the bestseller lists justified [285] Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had said he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979 [286]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nNixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his home at Park Ridge, New Jersey [300] A blood clot resulting from the atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain [301] He was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg [300] Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma He died at 9:08 p.m on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside He was 81 years old [300]\n\n\nLegacy\nDefunct\n\n\nPersonality and public image\nNixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow [324]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nPrint sources\n\n\nNixon Library\n\n\nOther sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

and education\nRichard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9, 1913, in what was then the township precinct of Yorba Linda, California, [2] in a house built by his father, on his family's lemon ranch [1] [3] [4] His parents were Francis A Nixon and Hannah (Milhous) Nixon His mother was a Quaker, and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith Through his mother, Nixon was a descendant of the early English settler Thomas Cornell [5]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nNixon attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class [15] His older brother Harold had attended Whittier High School, which his parents thought resulted in Harold's dissolute lifestyle, before he contracted tuberculosis (that killed him in 1933) They decided to send Nixon to the larger Fullerton Union High School [16] [17] Though he had to ride a school bus an hour each way during his freshman year, he attained excellent grades Later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week [18] He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, though he rarely was used in games [19] He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H Lynn Sheller Nixon later mused on Sheller's words, \"Remember, speaking is conversation...don't shout at people Talk to them Converse with them.\" [20] Nixon said he tried to use a conversational tone as much as possible [20]\n\n\nCollege and law school\nNixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but with Harold's continued illness requiring his mother's care, Richard was needed at the store He remained in his hometown, and enrolled at Whittier College in September 1930 His expenses were met by his maternal grandfather [1] [22] Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football, and though he lacked the size to play, he remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm [23] Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins, many of whom were from prominent families, unlike Nixon He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society [24] In addition to the society, his studies, and work at the store, Nixon engaged in several extracurricular activities; he was a champion debater and hard worker [25] In 1933, he was engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief, but they broke up in 1935 [26]\n\n\nEarly career and marriage\nAfter graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join the FBI He received no response to his letter of application, and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts [33] He was admitted to the California bar in 1937, and began practicing in Whittier with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in the National Bank of Whittier Building [27] [34]  His work concentrated on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills [35] Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women [36] In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California, [37] and became a full partner in the firm the following year [38] In later years, Nixon proudly said he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney [36]  During this period, Nixon was also the president of the Citra-Frost Company, which attempted to produce and sell frozen orange juice, but the company went bankrupt after just 18 months [39] [40]\n\n\nMilitary service\nIn January 1942, the couple moved to the Northern Virginia suburbs, where Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration in Washington, D.C [27] [45] In his political campaigns, Nixon suggested that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941 Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier [46] He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence He did not enjoy the role, and four months later applied to join the United States Navy [47] Though he could have claimed an exemption from the draft as a birthright Quaker, or a deferral due to his government service, Nixon nevertheless sought a commission in the Navy His application was approved, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the United States Naval Reserve on June 15, 1942 [48] [49]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1947–1950)\nRepublicans in California's 12th congressional district were frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic representative Jerry Voorhis, and they sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him In 1945, they formed a \"Committee of 100\" to decide on a candidate, hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to previous Voorhis victories After the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, Herman Perry, manager of Whittier's Bank of America branch, suggested Nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on Whittier College's board of trustees before the war Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore, and after a night of excited conversation with his wife, Nixon gave Perry an enthused response, [58] [59] confirming that he was registered to vote in California at his parents' Whittier residence [60] Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee When he left the Navy at the start of 1946, Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier, where he began a year of intensive campaigning [58] [59] He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a representative and suggested that Voorhis's endorsement by a group linked to Communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views [61] Nixon won the election, receiving 65,586 votes to Voorhis's 49,994 [62]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1950–1953)\nIn 1949, Nixon began to consider running for the United States Senate against the Democratic incumbent, Sheridan Downey, [74] and entered the race in November [75] Downey, faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, announced his retirement in March 1950 [76] Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections [77] and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue [78] Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas's liberal voting record As part of that effort, a \"Pink Sheet\" was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that Douglas's voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, reputed to be a communist, and their political views must be nearly identical [79] Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points [80] During the campaign, Nixon was first called \"Tricky Dick\" by his opponents for his campaign tactics [81]\n\n\nVice presidency (1953–1961)\nGeneral Dwight D Eisenhower was nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952 He had no strong preference for a vice-presidential candidate, and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a \"smoke-filled room\" and recommended Nixon to the general, who agreed to the senator's selection Nixon's youth (he was then 39), stance against communism, and political base in California—one of the largest states—were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Senator Robert A Taft of Ohio, Governor Alfred Driscoll of New Jersey, and Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois [85] [86] On the campaign trail, Eisenhower spoke of his plans for the country, and left the negative campaigning to his running mate [87]\n\n\n1960 presidential campaign\nIn 1960, Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States, officially announcing on January 9, 1960 [111] He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries [112] and chose former Massachusetts senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr as his running mate [113] His Democratic opponent was John F Kennedy and the race remained close for the duration [114] Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower–Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S in quantity and quality of ballistic missiles [115] While Kennedy faced issues about his Catholicism, Nixon remained a divisive figure to some [116]\n\n\n1962 California gubernatorial campaign\nLocal and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for governor of California in the 1962 gubernatorial election [113] Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race [113] The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor [113] Nixon hoped a successful run would confirm his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics [120] Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career [113]\n\n\nWilderness years\nIn 1963 the Nixon family traveled to Europe, where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited [124] The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander [113] When announcing his California campaign, Nixon had pledged not to run for president in 1964; even if he had not, he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson [125]\n\n\n1968 presidential campaign\nAt the end of 1967, Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life, [134] being embarrassed, for example, by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech [135] She still managed to be supportive of her husband's ambitions Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960 [134]\n\n\nPresidency (1969–1974)\nNixon was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1969, sworn in by his onetime political rival, Chief Justice Earl Warren Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at Isaiah 2:4, which reads, \"They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.\" In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that \"the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker\" [150]—a phrase that found a place on his gravestone [151] He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity:\n\n\nForeign policy\nNixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: \"There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation.\" [153] Among the reasons that Nixon sought to improve relations with China was in the hope of weakening the Soviet Union and decreasing China's support to the North in the Vietnam War [154] Nixon ultimately used the idea of gaining leverage against the Soviet Union through relations with China to obtain the support of key conservative figures including Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan [155]\n\n\nChina\nNixon laid the groundwork

Vietnam War [154] Nixon ultimately used the idea of gaining leverage against the Soviet Union through relations with China to obtain the support of key conservative figures including Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan [155]\n\n\nVietnam War\nWhen Nixon took office, about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam, [164] and the war was widely unpopular in the United States, the subject of ongoing violent protests The Johnson administration had offered to suspend bombing unconditionally in exchange for negotiations, but to no avail According to Walter Isaacson, Nixon concluded soon after taking office that the Vietnam War could not be won, and he was determined to end it quickly [165] He sought an arrangement that would permit American forces to withdraw while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack [166]\n\n\nLatin American policy\nNixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy during the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis On taking office in 1969, he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro The Soviets and Cubans became concerned, fearing Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev that ended the missile crisis In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding, which he did, despite his hard line against Castro The process was not completed before the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970 A minor confrontation ensued, the Soviets stipulated they would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles, and the final round of diplomatic notes were exchanged in November [183]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nNixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972, and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, among other leading Soviet officials [186]\n\n\nMiddle Eastern policy\n\n\n\nDomestic policy\nAt the time Nixon took office in 1969, inflation was at 4.7 percent—its highest rate since the Korean War The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century [203] Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war [203] This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency) [204] According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency [205]\n\n\nEconomy\nAt the time Nixon took office

little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency [205]\n\n\nGovernmental initiatives and organization\nNixon advocated a \"New Federalism\", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them [210] He eliminated the Cabinet-level United States Post Office Department, which in 1971 became the government-run United States Postal Service [211]\n\n\nCivil rights\nThe Nixon presidency witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South [223] Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites [224] Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use [225]\n\n\nSpace policy\nAfter a nearly decade-long national effort, the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11 Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their moonwalk He called the conversation \"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House\" [232]\n\n\nReelection, Watergate scandal, and resignation\nNixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment The Democratic \"Solid South\" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy Through his first term, he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights movement He nominated two Southern conservatives, Clement Haynsworth and G Harrold Carswell, to the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate [237]\n\n\n1972 presidential campaign\nNixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment The Democratic \"Solid South\" had long been a source of frustration to

but neither was confirmed by the Senate [237]\n\n\nWatergate\nThe term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration Those activities included \"dirty tricks\", such as bugging the offices of political opponents, and the harassment of activist groups and political figures The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into the Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972 The Washington Post picked up on the story; reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as \"Deep Throat\"—later revealed to be Mark Felt, associate director at the FBI—to link the men to the Nixon administration Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, and later the White House, were involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing [139] [247] [248]\n\n\nResignation\nIn light of his loss of political support and the near-certainty that he would be impeached and removed from office, Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, after addressing the nation on television the previous evening [250] The resignation speech was delivered from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television Nixon said he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, Gerald Ford Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency, especially in foreign policy [260] He defended his record as president, quoting from Theodore Roosevelt's 1910 speech Citizenship in a Republic:\n\n\nPost-presidency (1974–1994)\nFollowing his resignation, the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, California [264] According to his biographer, Jonathan Aitken, \"Nixon was a soul in torment\" after his resignation [265] Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses, though reducing the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000 With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7:00 a.m with little to do [265] His former press secretary, Ron Ziegler, sat with him alone for hours each day [266]\n\n\nPardon and illness\nFollowing his resignation, the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, California

him alone for hours each day [266]\n\n\nReturn to public life\nIn December 1974, Nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable ill will against him in the country He wrote in his diary, referring to himself and Pat,\n\n\nAuthor and elder statesman\nIn 1978, Nixon published his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, the first of nine books he was to author in his retirement [264] John A Farrell deemed it one of the better presidential memoirs, candid and capturing its author's voice; he deemed its rise up the bestseller lists justified [285] Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had said he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979 [286]\n\n\nDeath and funeral\nNixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his home at Park Ridge, New Jersey [300] A blood clot resulting from the atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain [301] He was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg [300] Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma He died at 9:08 p.m on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside He was 81 years old [300]\n\n\nLegacy\nDefunct\n\n\nPersonality and public image\nNixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow [324]\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nSee

it's hard writing a non-fiction book when all the people involved are telling you different stories\" [11] To paranormal investigator Benjamin Radford, Garton said of Lorraine, \"'If she told me the sun would come up tomorrow morning, I'd get a second opinion'\" [26]\n\n\nSmurl family\nPennsylvania residents Jack and Janet Smurl reported their home was disturbed by numerous supernatural phenomena, including sounds, smells and apparitions The Warrens became involved and claimed that the Smurl home was occupied by four spirits and also a demon that allegedly sexually assaulted Jack and Janet The Smurls' version of their story was the subject of a 1986 paperback titled The Haunted and television film of the same name directed by Robert Mandel.\n\n\nUnion Cemetery\nEd Warren's book Graveyard: True Hauntings from an Old New England Cemetery (St Martins Press, 1992) features a \"White Lady\" ghost which haunts Union Cemetery He claimed to have \"captured her essence\" on film [27]\n\n\nOther activities\nThe Warrens were responsible for training several self-described demonologists, including Dave Considine [28] and their nephew John Zaffis [29]\n\n\nEd Warren child sexual abuse accusation\nIn 2017, Judith Penney claimed that she had a 40-year sexual relationship with Ed, starting when she was 15 According to Penney, when she became pregnant, Lorraine persuaded her to have an abortion because the birth of a child would become a public scandal and could ruin the Warrens' business Penney also claimed to have witnessed the couple engaged in physical abuse Lorraine had it written into her contract for The Conjuring film series that she and Ed could not be portrayed having sex with each other, engaging in extramarital affairs, or engaging in crimes like sex with a minor [30] [31]\n\n\nPersonal lives\nEd and Lorraine Warren were members of the Roman Catholic Church [32] They married in 1945 [33] On January 11, 1946, Lorraine gave birth to their daughter named Judy Warren [34] [35]\n\n\nCriticism\nAccording to a 1997 interview with the Connecticut Post, Steve Novella and Perry DeAngelis investigated the Warrens for the New England Skeptical Society (NESS) They found the couple to be pleasant people, but their claims of demons and ghosts to be \"at best, as tellers of meaningless ghost stories, and at worst, dangerous frauds.\" They took the $13 tour and looked at all the evidence the Warrens had for spirits and ghosts They watched the videos and looked at the best evidence the Warrens had Their conclusion was that \"It's all blarney.\" They found common errors with flash photography and nothing evil in the artifacts the Warrens had collected \"They have.. a ton of fish stories about evidence that got away.. They're not doing good scientific investigation; they have a predetermined conclusion which they adhere to, literally and religiously,\" according to Novella Lorraine Warren said that the problem with Perry and Steve is that \"they don't base anything on a God\" Novella responded, \"It takes work to do solid, critical thinking, to actually employ your intellectual faculties and come to a conclusion that actually reflects reality .. That's what scientists do every day, and that's what skeptics advocate.\" [10]\n\n\nOccult Museum\nIn addition to the investigations, Lorraine ran the Warrens' Occult Museum (which closed to the public in 2019) [39] in the back of her house in Monroe, Connecticut, with the help of her son-in-law, Tony Spera [15] The museum displays many claimed haunted objects and artifacts from around the world Many of the artifacts from their most famous investigations were featured As of 2020, [40] the museum was owned by Judy Warren and Tony Spera [41]\n\n\nBibliography\nOver the years, several films and series have been released that are based in part or in full on the paranormal investigations or events that the Warrens are said to have witnessed and described Films that are partly based on their story are the films from The Amityville Horror series, including The Amityville Horror (1979) and The Amityville Horror (2005) [9] In 1991, a two-hour made-for-TV film based on the Smurl haunting, titled The Haunted, was released by 20th Century Fox Written by Robert Curran, Jack Smurl, Janet Smurl, Ed Warren, and Lorraine Warren, the film starred Jeffrey DeMunn as Jack Smurl and Sally Kirkland as Janet Smurl [46] The 2009 film The Haunting in Connecticut was loosely based on the 1986 Snedeker haunting investigated by the Warrens [47]\n\n\nFeatured in\nOver the years, several films and series have been released that are based in part or in full on the paranormal investigations or events that the Warrens are said to have witnessed and described Films that are partly based on their story are the films from The Amityville Horror series, including The Amityville Horror (1979) and The Amityville Horror (2005) [9] In 1991, a two-hour made-for-TV film based on the Smurl haunting, titled The Haunted, was released by 20th Century Fox Written by Robert Curran, Jack Smurl, Janet Smurl, Ed Warren, and Lorraine Warren, the film starred Jeffrey DeMunn as Jack Smurl and Sally Kirkland as Janet Smurl [46] The 2009 film The Haunting in Connecticut was loosely based on the 1986 Snedeker haunting investigated by the Warrens [47]\n\n\nMedia appearances\nOver the years, several films and series have been released that are based in part or in full on the paranormal investigations or events that the Warrens are said to have witnessed and described Films that are partly based on their story are the films from The Amityville Horror series, including The Amityville Horror (1979) and The Amityville Horror (2005) [9] In 1991, a two-hour made-for-TV film based on the Smurl haunting, titled The Haunted, was released by 20th Century Fox Written by Robert Curran, Jack Smurl, Janet Smurl, Ed Warren, and Lorraine Warren, the film starred Jeffrey DeMunn as Jack Smurl and Sally Kirkland as Janet Smurl [46] The 2009 film The Haunting in Connecticut was loosely based on the 1986 Snedeker haunting investigated by the Warrens [47]\n\n\nFilm adaptations\nOver the years, several films and series have been released that are based in part or in full on the paranormal investigations or events that the Warrens are said to have witnessed and described Films that are partly based on their story are the films from The Amityville Horror series, including The Amityville Horror (1979) and The Amityville Horror (2005) [9] In 1991, a two-hour made-for-TV film based on the Smurl haunting, titled The Haunted, was released by 20th Century Fox Written by Robert Curran, Jack Smurl, Janet Smurl, Ed Warren, and Lorraine Warren, the film starred Jeffrey DeMunn as Jack Smurl and Sally Kirkland as Janet Smurl [46] The 2009 film The Haunting in Connecticut was loosely based on the 1986 Snedeker haunting investigated by the Warrens [47]\n\n\nThe Conjuring Universe\nThe Warrens' case files serve as the basis for The Conjuring Universe series of horror films.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Ed and Lorraine Warren**\n\nThe Ed and Lorraine Warren were American paranormal investigators and authors who gained widespread recognition for their alleged investigations into the paranormal, particularly in the fields of demonology and ghost hunting. Their cases and experiences have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television series.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEd Warren (1926-2006) and Lorraine Warren (1927-2019) were married in 1945 and began investigating paranormal cases together in the 1950s. They became one of the most well-known and respected paranormal investigation teams in the world, with a reputation for tackling some of the most high-profile and challenging cases. Their investigations have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television series, and they have become household names.\n\n**Notable Investigations**\n\nOne of the most notable investigations conducted by the Warrens was the case of the Raggedy Ann doll, also known as Annabelle. According to the Warrens, in 1970, two roommates claimed that their Raggedy Ann doll was possessed by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle Higgins. The Warrens took the doll, telling the roommates it was \"being manipulated by an inhuman presence,\" and put it on display at the family's \"Occult Museum.\" The legend of the doll inspired several films in the Conjuring Universe and is a motif in many others.\n\n**Annabelle**\n\nThe Annabelle doll has become one of the most famous and iconic pieces of paranormal evidence, with numerous investigations and documentaries centered around it. The doll is said to be a manifestation of a malevolent spirit, and many have reported experiencing strange occurrences and unexplained phenomena while in the presence of the doll. The Warrens claimed that the doll was a vessel for the spirit of Annabelle Higgins, a young girl who died under mysterious circumstances.\n\n**Perron Family**\n\nIn 1971, the Warrens claimed that the Harrisville, Rhode Island home of the Perron family was haunted by a witch who had lived there in the early 19th century. According to the Warrens, Bathsheba Sherman cursed the land so that whoever lived there somehow died a terrible death. The story is the subject of the 2013 film The Conjuring, in which Lorraine Warren was a consultant and appeared in a cameo role.\n\n**Amityville**\n\nThe Warrens are best known for their involvement in the 1975 Amityville Horror, in which New York couple George and Kathy Lutz claimed that their house was haunted by a violent, demonic presence so intense that it eventually drove them out of their home. The Amityville Horror Conspiracy authors Stephen and Roxanne Kaplan characterized the case as a hoax, but Lorraine Warren told a reporter that the Amityville Horror was not a hoax. The reported haunting was the basis for the 1977 book The Amityville Horror and adapted into the 1979 and 2005 films of the same name.\n\n**Enfield Poltergeist**\n\nIn 1977, the Warrens investigated claims that a family in the North London suburb of Enfield was haunted by poltergeist activity. While a number of independent observers dismissed the incident as a hoax carried out by \"attention-hungry\" children, the Warrens were convinced that it was a case of \"demonic possession.\" The story was the inspiration for The Conjuring 2, although critics say the Warrens were involved \"to a far lesser degree than portrayed in the movie.\"\n\n**Arne Johnson**\n\nIn 1981, Arne Cheyenne Johnson was accused of killing his landlord, Alan Bono. Ed and Lorraine Warren had been called prior to the killing to deal with the alleged demonic possession of the younger brother of Johnson's fiancée. The Warrens subsequently claimed that Johnson was also possessed. At trial, Johnson attempted to plead Not Guilty by Reason of Demonic Possession, but was unsuccessful with his plea. This story serves as the inspiration for The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021).\n\n**Snedeker House**\n\nIn 1986, Ed and Lorraine Warren arrived and proclaimed the Snedeker house, a former funeral home, to be infested with demons. The case was featured in the 1993 book In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting, and a TV film that later became part of the Discovery Channel series A Haunting was produced in 2002. The Haunting in Connecticut, a film based on the Warrens' version of events and directed by Peter Cornwell, was released in 2009.\n\n**Smurl Family**\n\nPennsylvania residents Jack and Janet Smurl reported their home was disturbed by numerous supernatural phenomena, including sounds, smells, and apparitions. The Warrens became involved and claimed that the Smurl home was occupied by four spirits and also a demon that allegedly sexually assaulted Jack and Janet.

Born in 1942 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Rydell has had a successful music career spanning over six decades. He has released numerous albums and singles, and has been a part of several bands and musical groups.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBobby Rydell was born in April 1942 to Jennie Ridarelli (née Sapienza) and Adrio \"Al\" Ridarelli. Both of his parents were of Italian descent, and grew up in the Lower Moyamensing neighborhood of South Philadelphia. Rydell's early life was marked by his love for music, and he began playing the drums at a young age. He attended St. Mark's High School, where he was a member of the school's band and choir.\n\n**Music Career**\n\nRydell's music career began in the 1950s, when he played in several bands in the Philadelphia area. As a 14-year-old, he was the drummer for the Emanons, a band that included his childhood friend Pat Azzara on guitar. Azzara later assumed the stage name Pat Martino, and went on to achieve recognition as one of the preeminent jazz guitarists of all time. Another band that Rydell was a part of was Rocco and the Saints, in which he sang and played drums.\n\nAfter releasing three unsuccessful singles for small companies, Rydell signed a recording contract with Cameo Records. The label was run by Bernie Lowe, who had been the pianist accompanying Rydell on TV's \"Teen Club\". Rydell's first single for Cameo was \"Kissin' Time\", which became a hit in 1959. The song's success was followed by another hit, \"Wild One\", which was released in 1960.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRydell has been married twice. His first wife, Camille Quattrone Ridarelli, was his high school sweetheart, and they were married for 35 years until her death in 2003. They had two children together. Rydell's second wife, Linda Hoffman, whom he married in 2009, has been a constant source of support and encouragement throughout his music career.\n\nThroughout his life, Rydell has been a resident of Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, and has lived in the same house from 1963 to 2019. He currently resides in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania.\n\n**Health and Death**\n\nIn 2012, Rydell's health began to deteriorate significantly, and he was in need of urgent major surgery. He cancelled a scheduled tour in Australia and underwent a double organ transplant at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. The surgery was successful, and Rydell returned to the stage six months later for a sold-out engagement in Las Vegas.\n\nDespite his health issues, Rydell continued to perform internationally and returned to tour Australia in 2014. He has been open about his health struggles and has used his platform to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation.\n\n**Media**\n\nRydell's music and legacy have been featured in several films and television shows. The high school in the Broadway musical drama \"Grease\" and its film adaptation was named \"Rydell High\" after him.

May played guitar on the song \"Someone to Die For\" on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack in 2004.\n\n**2004-2009: Queen + Paul Rodgers**\n\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers, the founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company. Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \"featured with\" Queen as Queen + Paul Rodgers, not replacing the late Freddie Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.\n\n**2011-Present**\n\nOn April 18, 2011, Lady Gaga confirmed that May would play guitar on her track \"You and I\" from her latest album Born This Way, released on May 23, 2011. May joined Gaga on stage during the performance of \"You and I\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards held at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. May performed with Tangerine Dream at the Starmus Festival on Tenerife in June 2011, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's first spaceflight.\n\nNot long after performing with American Idol finalists Kris Allen and Adam Lambert during the programme's season finale in 2009, May and Taylor began contemplating the future of Queen after the group's amicable split with frontman Paul Rodgers. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Queen was presented with that year's Global Icon Award, accepted by May. As part of the broadcast, Queen performed a short set with Lambert, receiving an overwhelmingly welcoming response. Speculation regarding collaboration with Lambert soon arose, with the three formally announcing a short summer tour of Europe in 2012, including three dates at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, as well as shows in Ukraine, Russia, and Poland.\n\n**Musicianship**\n\nBrian May is known for his distinctive guitar playing style, which combines elements of rock, blues, and classical music. His guitar playing is characterized by his use of a homemade guitar, known as the \"Red Special,\" which he built with his father in 1963. May's guitar playing style is also known for its use of feedback, distortion, and other effects.\n\n**Guitar Style**\n\nMay's early influences included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, who he says were \"the most metallic thing(s) out at the time.\" Many years later he gained his opportunity to play on separate occasions with the Shadows' lead guitarist Hank Marvin. He has collaborated with Richard on a re-recording of 1958 hit \"Move It\" on Richard's duets album Two's Company, which was released on November 6, 2006.\n\n**Equipment**\n\nFrom 1975 onwards, May had some replicas made of the Red Special, some of which were also used for live and recording purposes, others being mainly spares. The most famous replicas were made by John Birch in 1975 (May smashed it during a concert in the US in 1982), Greco BM90 (featured in the promo video of \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in 1977), Guild (back-up from 1984 to 1993), Fryers (1997-1998, used both live and in the studio) and Guyton (back-up from 2003 to present). On stage, May used to carry at least one backup guitar (in case he broke a string) He occasionally would use others for specific songs or parts, such as alternate tunings. Currently, May owns a company that makes guitars whose design is modelled after the original Red Special guitar.\n\n**Amplifiers and Effects**\n\nMay has been known to use a variety of amplifiers and effects throughout his career. He has used a range of Marshall and Hiwatt amplifiers, as well as a variety of effects pedals, including distortion, overdrive, and delay pedals.\n\n**Piano and Other Instruments**\n\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\" and \"Flash\"). He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano. From 1979 onwards, he also played synthesisers, organ (\"Wedding March,\" \"Let Me Live\") and programmed drum-machines for both Queen and outside projects (such as producing other artists and his own solo records). In the studio, May used Yamaha DX7 synths for the opening sequence of \"One Vision\" and the backgrounds of \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" (also on stage), \"Scandal\" and \"The Show Must Go On.\"\n\n**Vocals**\n\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's Queen II to The Game, May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with Lee Holdridge, Il Colosso, for Steve Barron's 1996 film, The Adventures of Pinocchio. May performed the opera with Jerry Hadley, Sissel Kyrkjebo, and Just William. On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n**Scientific Career**\n\nMay studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and ARCS in physics with Upper Second-Class Honours. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a PhD degree at Imperial College, studying reflected light from interplanetary dust and the velocity of dust in the plane of the Solar System. When Queen began to have international success in 1974, he abandoned his doctoral studies, but nonetheless co-authored two peer-reviewed research papers, which were based on his observations at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFrom 1976 to 1988, May was married to Christine Mullen. They had three children. They separated in 1988. May met actress Anita Dobson in 1986. She inspired him to write the 1989 hit \"I Want It All.\" They married on November 18, 2000.\n\n**Activism**\n\nAlthough a Conservative Party voter most of his life, May has stated that their policies on fox hunting and the culling of badgers meant he did not vote for them in the 2010 UK general election.\n\n**Animal Welfare**\n\nIn 2010, May formed an animal welfare organization Save Me (named after the May-written Queen song). It campaigns for the protection of wild animals with a particular emphasis on preventing hunting of foxes and the culling of badgers. May has commented that \"to this day, nobody has been able to prove a mechanism for the transfer of bTB from badger to cow\" and has suggested that culling badgers has no benefit. The group's primary concern is to ensure that the Hunting Act 2004 and other laws protecting animals are retained in situ.\n\n**Stereophotography**\n\nMay has had a lifelong interest in collecting Victorian stereophotography. In 2009, with co-author Elena Vidal, he published his second book, A Village Lost and Found, on the work of English stereophotography innovator T R Williams. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Saxby Medal in 2012 for achievement in the field of three-dimensional imaging.\n\n**Portrayal in Film**\n\nIn the 2018 biographical film Bohemian Rhapsody, he was portrayed by Gwilym Lee. May himself served as a creative and musical consultant for the film, and worked especially closely with Lee.\n\n**Discography**\n\nWith Queen:\n\n* Queen (1973)\n* Queen II (1974)\n* Sheer Heart

{"title": "Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cornwall_and_Cambridge", "content": "\nEarly life\nPrince William was born at 21:03 BST on 21 June 1982 in St Mary's Hospital, London, as the first child of Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III), and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II [3] [4] [5] Buckingham Palace announced his name – William Arthur Philip Louis – on 28 June [3] William was christened in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, on 4 August, coinciding with the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [6] [b]\n\n\nEducation\nWilliam was educated at private schools, starting at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London [30] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by Rory Stewart [31] At Ludgrove, he participated in football, swimming, basketball, clay pigeon shooting, and cross country running He was subsequently admitted to Eton College, studying geography, biology, and history of art at A-Level He obtained an 'A' in geography, a 'C' in biology, and a 'B' in history of art [32] [33] [34] William was captain of the swimming team and his house football team at Eton, also taking up water polo [35] [36]\n\n\nEarly appointments and duties\nAt the age of 21, William was appointed a Counsellor of State; he first served in that capacity when the Queen attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the same year [50] In July 2005, he embarked on his first solo public engagements on an overseas tour of New Zealand, travelling to participate in World War II commemorations [51] [50] According to author Tina Brown, he had, like his father, expressed a desire to become Governor-General of Australia [52] In 2009 the Queen set up a private office for William and Harry with David Manning as their adviser [53] Manning accompanied William on his first official tour in January 2010 as the latter toured Auckland and Wellington; William opened the new building of the Supreme Court of New Zealand and was welcomed by a Māori chief [54] [55]  The visit spurred crowds of \"many thousands\", with positive  public reception compared to that of his mother's 1983 tour [56] In March 2011, William visited Christchurch, New Zealand, shortly after the earthquake, [57] and spoke at the memorial service at Hagley Park on behalf of his grandmother [58] He also travelled to Australia to visit areas affected by flooding in Queensland and Victoria [59] [60]\n\n\nMilitary and air ambulance service\nHaving decided on a military career, William was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006; his admission was based on successfully completing a 44-week course as an Officer Cadet which led to his commission as a British Army officer [65] [66] As \"Lieutenant Wales\" – a name based on his father's then title Prince of Wales – he followed his brother [67] into the Blues and Royals in December that year as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit, after which he spent five months training for the post at Bovington Camp in Dorset [68] [69]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2001 William met Catherine Middleton, while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall, at the University of St Andrews, and they became close friends [109] [110] She reportedly caught William's attention at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress [111] During their second year, William shared a flat with Middleton and two other friends [112] The couple began dating in 2003 [113] From 2003 to 2005 they both resided at Balgove House on the Strathtyrum estate with two roommates [114] In 2004 the couple briefly split but reconciled soon afterwards [115]\n\n\nRelationship with Catherine Middleton\nIn 2001 William met Catherine Middleton, while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall, at the University of St Andrews, and they became close friends [109] [110] She reportedly caught William's attention at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress [111] During their second year, William shared a flat with Middleton and two other friends [112] The couple began dating in 2003 [113] From 2003 to 2005 they both resided at Balgove House on the Strathtyrum estate with two roommates [114] In 2004 the couple briefly split but reconciled soon afterwards [115]\n\n\nMarriage and children\nThe couple became engaged in October 2010, at a remote alpine cabin on Mount Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate William's passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course [125] Clarence House announced their engagement on 16 November [126] William gave his fiancée his mother's engagement ring [127] The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011 [128] The global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million, whereas 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone [129] [130] William and Catherine used Nottingham Cottage as their London home until 2013, when £4.5 million renovations completed at Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, which continues to be their official residence in the capital [131] [132] [133] The couple were given the country house Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, as a wedding gift from the Queen, where they lived from 2015 to 2017 [134] [135] Kensington Palace was the couple's main residence until 2022, when the family moved to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nDuke of Cambridge\nWilliam was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus on the day of his wedding in April 2011 [148] [149] He and Catherine toured Canada that summer [150] Nicholas Witchell, writing for BBC News, noted that the tour to Canada had been an \"unqualified success\" for the couple as they engaged in various activities from tree planting to street hockey, with their warm interactions and thoughtful gestures enhancing their popularity and reinforcing positive sentiments towards the monarchy in Canada [151] The couple served as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, during multiple sporting events throughout the games [152]\n\n\nPrince of Wales\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, and William's father succeeded as Charles III William, now heir apparent, was created Prince of Wales by his father on 9 September [195] Controversy regarding the title became a topic of public debate in Wales [196] By 17 September, a petition calling for the end of the title had received over 30,000 signatures, [197] while a YouGov poll showed 66 per cent support for William to be given the title compared to 22 percent of respondents opposed [198] On 30 October, Senedd Llywydd Elin Jones noted that an investiture is not a constitutional requirement and suggested that contemporary Wales would deem it unnecessary [199] Kensington Palace also stated an investiture is \"not on the table\" [200] As the eldest son of the British monarch, William has inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, which brings him additional income [201] [202] The duchy is \"a £760 million (about US$1.25 billion) entity established in 1337\" to provide a private income to the monarch's eldest son [62]\n\n\nCharity work\nWilliam became aware of HIV/AIDS in the mid-1990s when he accompanied his mother and brother on visits to shelters and clinics for patients In January 2005, he and Harry volunteered at a British Red Cross aid distribution centre to pack emergency supplies for countries affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami [213] Later, in December 2005, William spent two weeks in North Wales with Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW) [214] In May 2007, he became patron of MREW and president of the Royal Marsden Hospital, the latter of which was a role previously held by his mother [215]\n\n\nHumanitarian causes\nIn March 2020, William appeared in a video for the National Emergencies Trust, launching a fundraising appeal to help charities during the pandemic The appeal raised £11 million in its first week, eventually totalling to £90 million, with the money going out to \"front line charities\" and to the UK Community Foundations to be distributed among \"local community foundations\" [222] In April 2020, he officially became patron of the organisation [223] Later that month, he made a surprise appearance on The Big Night In, a telethon held during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a skit which he held a video call with Stephen
