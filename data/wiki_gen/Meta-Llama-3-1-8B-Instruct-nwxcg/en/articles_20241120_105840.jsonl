[12]\n\n\nFilming\nThe film was one of the rare Ukrainian-language feature film productions at the Ukrainian Dovzhenko Film Studios, which typically produced only Russian-language film productions, some of which were later dubbed into the Ukrainian language for theatrical distribution in UkrSSR The government officials had asked Parajanov to make a Russian version of the film, to which he stated that he has “long resisted translating the Ukrainian-language film dialogues into the Russian language\" because he \"considered this text to be an inalienable part of the artistic fabric of the film” [13] [11] In his 1988 interview with Ron Holloway, Parajanov confessed that \"the ministry asked me to make a Russian  [dubbed] version  [of the film] The film was not only shot in the Ukrainian language, but it was also in the Hutsul dialect  [of Ukrainian language] They asked me to dub the film in Russian but I turned them down categorically.\" [14]\n\n\nCasting\nOriginally, Parajanov planned to cast a rising-star and box-office magnet Russian actor Genadi Yukhtin to play the main protagonist Ivan, but under the recommendation of filmmaker Viktor Ivchenko, along with comments from the film's cinematographer Yuri Ilyenko, that \"Yukhtin just did not fit the part and when  [during the try-outs] he dressed in the Ukrainian hutsul garments, it wasn't a fit for him\", Parajanov later changed his decision, and cast a Ukrainian actor Ivan Mykolaichuk instead [17]\n\n\nMusic\nThe music was written by composer Myroslav Skoryk, who wrote the score inspired by Ukrainian hutsul folk culture [6] The haunting Ukrainian-folk music contributes to the film's grandeur, and is considered to be one of Skoryk's greatest film scores.\n\n\nRelease\nThroughout the film's festival run in Spring 1965, it represented \"the Soviet Union\" and not \"the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\", despite the fact that it was very distinctly Ukrainian In 1965, the Head of State Film Agency of UkrSSR, Sviatoslav Ivanov  [uk], described in his diary how he, along with the film's main actors Larisa Kadochnikova and Ivan Mykolaychuk, went to Argentina for the Mar del Plata International Film Festival to represent the film there, noting that “we represented at the festival the Soviet Union, and we were not the Ukrainian, but the Soviet delegation I was not offended by the words of greetings addressed to the Soviet Union (the crowd of Mar del Plata cried: ‘Viva Moscú’, ‘Viva Unión Soviética’)  [...] We were just representatives of a great people and they  [the Argentines] did not suspect the subtleties of relations within the two nations  [of Russians and Ukrainians]\" [21] [22]\n\n\nFestival release\nThroughout the film's festival run in Spring 1965, it represented \"the

program of Cultural Dissent (Italian: Il Dissenso Culturale) was organised as a show of support by Italian artists for the repressed dissident artists from the Soviet Union and other communist countries [48] A part of this program consisted of a special seminar dedicated to the works of Parajanov and was aimed at showing support for his illegal imprisonment on trumped-up charges of homosexuality [49] The program also held a special Cinema from the Eastern Countries (Italian: Cinema e Paesi dell'Est) event in which two of Parajanov's films, one of which was Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, were screened [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] Ahead of this screening, Lino Miccichè – who later became the president of the Venice Film Festival in 1997 – read a declaration which was signed by Italian filmmakers and film critics addressed to the government of the Soviet Union with a protest against the repression of dissident artists [55] [56]\n\n\nTheatrical release\nThe film began its theatrical release in UkrSSR on 4 September 1965 with a gala premiere in Kyiv at the Ukrayina movie theatre [57] [58] [6] This Kyiv premiere drew a significant political protest due to the growing imprisonment and oppression of Ukrainian intellectuals by the Soviet regime [59] [60] [13] [61]\n\n\nHome media and Restoration\nIn 2011, Ukrainian newspapers reported that in 2010, the Dovzhenko Centre had hired a company called TOV IBS to create a restored version of multiple films which included Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors as a part of the centre's push to release two DVD collections of thematic movies known as the Ivan Mykolaichuk Collection and the Yuri Ilyenko Collection [62] [63] The type of restoration made in 2010 remains unknown, but the fact remains that the Dovzhenko Centre has indeed released a restored version of the film on DVD as a part of both collections, even as they were not for sale and were only intended for insider events [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nReception\nThe theatrical release of Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors had enjoyed a limited commercial success in UkrSSR and other republics of the USSR [89] The film drew an impressive 6.5 million (according to some sources 8.5 million) admissions during its theatrical run from 1965 to 1966 [90] across the UkrSSR and other republics of the USSR This was the second best of Parajanov's movies, only behind his 1959

contributes to the film's grandeur, and is considered to be one of Skoryk's greatest film scores.\n\n\nRelease\nThroughout the film's festival run in Spring 1965, it represented \"the Soviet Union\" and not \"the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\", despite the fact that it was very distinctly Ukrainian In 1965, the Head of State Film Agency of UkrSSR, Sviatoslav Ivanov  [uk], described in his diary how he, along with the film's main actors Larisa Kadochnikova and Ivan Mykolaychuk, went to Argentina for the Mar del Plata International Film Festival to represent the film there, noting that “we represented at the festival the Soviet Union, and we were not the Ukrainian, but the Soviet delegation I was not offended by the words of greetings addressed to the Soviet Union (the crowd of Mar del Plata cried: ‘Viva Moscú’, ‘Viva Unión Soviética’)  [...] We were just representatives of a great people and they  [the Argentines] did not suspect the subtleties of relations within the two nations  [of Russians and Ukrainians]\" [21] [22]\n\n\nFestival release\nThroughout the film's festival run in Spring 1965, it represented \"the Soviet Union\" and not \"the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist

[22]\n\n\nSpecial screening at Venice Biennale 1977\nIn 1977, the usual Venice Film Festival was not held Instead, a special cultural program of Cultural Dissent (Italian: Il Dissenso Culturale) was organised as a show of support by Italian artists for the repressed dissident artists from the Soviet Union and other communist countries [48] A part of this program consisted of a special seminar dedicated to the works of Parajanov and was aimed at showing support for his illegal imprisonment on trumped-up charges of homosexuality [49] The program also held a special Cinema from the Eastern Countries (Italian: Cinema e Paesi dell'Est) event in which two of Parajanov's films, one of which was Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, were screened [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] Ahead of this screening, Lino Miccichè – who later became the president of the Venice Film Festival in 1997 – read a declaration which was signed by Italian filmmakers and film critics addressed to the government of the Soviet Union with a protest against the repression of dissident artists [55] [56]\n\n\nTheatrical release\nThe film began its theatrical release in UkrSSR on 4 September 1965 with a gala premiere in Kyiv at the Ukrayina movie theatre [57] [58] [6] This Kyiv premiere drew a significant political protest due to the growing imprisonment and oppression of Ukrainian intellectuals by the Soviet regime [59] [60] [13] [61]\n\n\nHome media and Restoration\nIn 2011, Ukrainian newspapers reported that in 2010, the Dovzhenko Centre had hired a company called TOV IBS to create a restored version of multiple films which included Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors as a part of the centre's push to release two DVD collections of thematic movies known as the Ivan Mykolaichuk Collection and the Yuri Ilyenko Collection [62] [63] The type of restoration made in 2010 remains unknown, but the fact remains that the Dovzhenko Centre has indeed released a restored version of the film on DVD as a part of both collections, even as they were not for sale and were only intended for insider events [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nReception\nThe theatrical release of Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors had enjoyed a limited commercial success in UkrSSR and other republics of the USSR [89] The film drew an impressive 6.5 million (according to some sources 8.5 million) admissions during its theatrical run from 1965 to 1966 [90] across the UkrSSR and other republics of the USSR This was the second best of Parajanov's movies, only behind his 1959 communist kolhosp flick The Top Guy which amassed 21.7 million admissions in domestic USSR box-office [91] [92]\n\n\nBox office\nThe theatrical release of Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors had enjoyed a limited commercial success in UkrSSR and other republics of the USSR [89] The

Year listed Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors among four stand-out films that came out that year from Eastern Europe and called it a \"free-wheeling, extravagantly sumptuous saga\" [93] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.The website's critical consensus states: \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors impresses with its kinetic visual approach, but it's the affecting story and soulful performances that truly linger\" [94] On the ranking aggregator website TSPDT the film is ranked 431st in their ranking of 1000 Greatest Films [95]\n\n\nAwards and notable film festival screenings\nThe film began its international film festival tour in Spring 1965 and was warmly received by the film festival crowd [6] Among the many awards received and the non-competition screenings that the film had, the most notable were: [28] [111] [112] [113]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 2013 the band A Hawk and a Hacksaw

previously filming 8 films in Ukraine, it was in this film that he was finally able to \"find his theme, his field of interest: the problems faced by the  [Ukrainian] people\" Parajanov further emphasised that he deliberately \"focused on ethnography, on God, on love and tragedy\" [14]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Cooperative in Moab, Utah [11] The caller said they saw a man slap a woman, after which the man and woman ran up and down the sidewalk, then the man hit the woman again before they drove off together [13] Another witness described the incident to police as looking like Petito and Laundrie were talking \"aggressively\" and that Petito \"was punching him in the arm\" The witness said it looked like Laundrie was trying to leave Petito behind and take her phone with him Before they drove off together, she climbed into the driver's seat, moved over into the passenger's seat so he could drive, and

determined that the manner of death was homicide by \"blunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation\", [48] which occurred three to four weeks before the body was found [13]\n\n\nSearch for Laundrie and discovery of remains\nOn September 23, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming issued an arrest warrant for Laundrie due to his unauthorized use

than Brian Laundrie directly involved in the tragic death of Gabby Petito The FBI's primary focus throughout the investigation was to bring justice to Gabby and her family.\" [60]\n\n\nPublic interest\nThe case sparked more public interest and coverage on news and social media than other missing persons and murder cases [63] [64] [65] This heightened interest was attributed to several factors, such as the refusal by Laundrie and his parents to comment on Petito's whereabouts, [13] the amount of content on social media documenting the couple's lifestyle, [66] the video footage of the Utah traffic stop, the audio recording of the 9-1-1 call, [63] [66] [67] the video posts by witnesses which provided a lot of publicly available evidence, the idea that those involved were a young and attractive couple in a romantic getaway gone wrong, [64] [66] the domestic violence incidents in their relationship, an increased interest in cross-country van-dwelling trips due to the COVID-19

Florida judge previously allowed the suit to proceed [77] On November 17, 2022, in a lawsuit for wrongful death brought against Laundrie's estate by Petito's estate, her estate was awarded $3 million,

rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 61 [16]\n\n\nPrevious head-to-head record\nPrior to the match, Nepomniachtchi and Carlsen had played 13 games against each other at classical time controls, of which Nepomniachtchi won 4 and Carlsen 1, with 8 draws Several of these games were played when they were juniors, however, and in the five years before the match their head-to-head score was 1 win each with 4 draws [18] Their most recent pre-championship game, during the 2021 Norway Chess tournament, was a draw [19]\n\n\nLocation\nBids were originally to be presented to FIDE no later than 1 March 2019, with inspection of the proposed venues between 1 July and 15 August 2019 [21]\n\n\nSanctions against Russia\nDue to WADA sanctions against Russia, FIDE confirmed that Nepomniachtchi would not compete under the Russian flag, but would play as a neutral player The sanctions apply only to the world championship match, not to other FIDE events such as the Candidates Tournament The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a ban on Russia competing at World Championships, and it is implemented by WADA in response to the state-sponsored doping program of Russian athletes [27] [28]\n\n\nSeconds\nNepomniachtchi was helped by seconds Sergey Yanovsky, Vladimir Potkin, Peter Leko and Sergey Karjakin [31] [32] Carlsen's seconds were revealed after the match

½–½\nGame 1 was a 45-move draw Nepomniachtchi (White) opened with 1.e4, and the game developed into a Ruy Lopez The players followed established lines until Carlsen (Black) played 8...Na5, the top choice of the neural network chess engine Leela Chess Zero [37] Nepomniachtchi quickly played the strong but not obvious move 14.Kf1!, indicating that he was still within his preparation Carlsen sacrificed a pawn in return for the bishop pair, more space, and more activity Nepomniachtchi played some inaccurate moves (22.Bf4?! and 30.Ne1?!), allowing Carlsen to gain a slightly better position With Carlsen pressing, Nepomniachtchi defended accurately, returning the pawn to neutralize Black's initiative and reached a threefold repetition draw In his commentary, GM Sam Shankland expressed concern about Carlsen's opening preparation, noting that he had failed to equalize in the opening [37]\n\n\nGame 2: Carlsen–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\nGame 2 was a 58-move draw Carlsen played the Catalan Opening, and Nepomniachtchi elected to hold the pawn with 7...b5 rather than return it with the usual 7...a6, giving Carlsen an advantage in development and central position Although the variation was clearly in Carlsen's preparation, Nepomniachtchi did not shirk from a battle with 13...Nd3 [40] The resulting middlegame was complicated, with Carlsen holding an advantage until the inaccurate 17.Ne5 Carlsen later confessed that he had missed his opponent's response 18...Nac5 Nepomniachtchi won the exchange, but White had strong compensation and initiative The game continued to be complicated, with commentator Sam Shankland writing that he thought White had an advantage before consulting an engine, which clearly favoured Black [40] GM Anish Giri called Nepomniatchi's 24...c3 a \"panicky\" move, and indeed this gave up most of his advantage [41] White had an opportunity to push for more, but an inaccuracy by Carlsen allowed Nepomniachtchi to force a theoretically drawn position After a forced queen exchange, Carlsen played on for 15 moves, but the result was never in doubt [40]\n\n\nGame 3: Nepomniachtchi–Carlsen, ½–½\nGame 3 was a 41-move draw Like Game 1, the players played the Ruy Lopez Nepomniachtchi deviated first with 8.a4, but Carlsen was prepared and equalized smoothly White had a small initiative, but after an accurate bishop maneuver by Black (17...Bc8 followed by ...Be6 preparing ...d5), mass exchanges into a drawn endgame followed [42] Chess.com called Carlsen's preparation with Black thus far \"bulletproof\", although Carlsen remarked during the postgame conference that it had not been as easy as it looked, and he had not managed to get many chances [42]\n\n\nGame 4: Carlsen–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\nGame 4 was a 33-move draw Carlsen opened with 1.e4, against which Nepomniachtchi played Petrov's Defence The game followed known theory until Carlsen tried the novelty 18.Nh4 Although an interesting move, Nepomniachtchi had seen the idea before and had prepared for the variation Although the position looked risky for Nepomniachtchi with a knight stuck on f8, [43] the passed a-pawn provided strong counterplay Carlsen thought for 50 minutes looking for winning chances, before acquiescing to a draw by threefold repetition [44]\n\n\nGame 5: Nepomniachtchi–Carlsen, ½–½\nGame 5 was a 43-move draw Similar to games 1 and 3, Nepomniachtchi opened with e4 following the Ruy Lopez opening The endgame resulted in a draw by threefold repetition.\n\n\nGame 6: Carlsen–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\nGame 6 was a 136-move win for Carlsen that lasted 7 hours 45 minutes As of 2023 [update], it is the longest game in the history of the World Chess Championship, surpassing the previous record, a 124-move draw in game 5 of the World Chess Championship 1978 between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi [46]\n\n\nGame 7: Nepomniachtchi–Carlsen, ½–½\nGame 7 was a 41-move draw Carlsen equalized smoothly out of another Ruy Lopez, after which the players heavily exchanged material leading to a drawn position The position was completely lifeless by the 28th move, with the remainder of the game a formality to accede to the rules regarding draw offers For many commentators, this lifeless draw was not surprising because of how draining game 6 had been (it had ended after midnight) [54]\n\n\nGame 8: Carlsen–Nepomniachtchi, 1–0\nGame 8 was a 46-move win for Carlsen Nepomniachtchi blundered a pawn in the middle game, leaving him with a lost position, and Carlsen carefully and accurately converted his advantage to a win in the queen-and-pawn endgame This gave Carlsen a two-game lead, with commentators saying it was now difficult for Nepomniachtchi to win the match [57]\n\n\nGame 9: Nepomniachtchi–Carlsen, 0–1\nGame 9 was a 39-move win for Carlsen Nepomniachtchi played the English opening, a good psychological choice because there are few forcing lines for Black [59] He managed to get a complicated position out of the opening, which was also a success because such positions often provide greater opportunities for a win On move 15, Nepomniachtchi missed the idea 15.b4, which temporarily sacrifices a pawn for open lines Nepomniachtchi agreed that this idea was promising when it was pointed out to him during the press conference As the game continued, Carlsen missed White's 24.Qe1 when playing 21...Qb4, which allowed White to win the b7-pawn, but Black had sufficient compensation One move after capturing the b7-pawn, however, Nepomniachtchi blundered a bishop with 27.c5??, leaving the bishop trapped after 27...c6 [60] Nepomniachtchi found the best practical try after the blunder, but, down a bishop, his position could not be salvaged This win gave Carlsen a three-point lead over Nepomniachtchi, and commentators agreed this virtually assured Carlsen would win the match [59] [61] [62]\n\n\nGame 10: Carlsen–Nepomniachtchi, ½–½\nGame 10 was a 41-move draw It was a quick, quiet game with the players eventually splitting the point Nepomniachtchi surprised commentators by again meeting Carlsen's 1 e4 with the Petroff Defense, indicating that he was happy with a draw despite the match situation The queens were quickly exchanged and a symmetrical position with no weaknesses on both sides appeared on the board, leading to a draw Shankland described the game as a \"snoozefest\" and suggested that were draw offers permitted before move 40, the players might well have called the game off as early as move 11 [63]\n\n\nGame 11: Nepomniachtchi–Carlsen, 0–1\nGame 11 was a 49-move win for Carlsen Nepomniachtchi began with 1.e4, as he had in games 1, 3, 5, and 7, but deviated with 3.Bc4, the Italian Game, instead of the Ruy Lopez he had played previously He did not play the most ambitious moves, and Black achieved the central pawn break ...d5 – thematic in the Italian – before White did With no advantage, Nepomniachtchi blundered again with 23.g3??, a surprising blunder because Black has only one good response, but that response wins Carlsen did not play the most direct winning lines afterwards, but still simplified the position into a comfortable pawn-up rook endgame which he converted without trouble Commentators suggested that 23.Rxd4 could have maintained a drawn position [64]\n\n\nReaction\nA number of commentators expressed regret and surprise over Nepomniachtchi's poor performance in the second half of the match, where he lost three games due to uncharacteristic blunders The exhausting game six was identified as a possible explanation for the Russian grandmaster's seeming collapse A typical comment, from the Chess.com summary of the match, reads:\n\n\nAftermath\nPer regulation, Carlsen won €1.2 million while Nepomniachtchi took home €800,000

The song's unique blend of history, music, and cultural commentary has made it a beloved and enduring classic.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea for the song came to Joel when he was in a recording studio and met a 21-year-old friend of Sean Lennon, who said, \"It's a terrible time to be 21!\" Joel replied, \"Yeah, I remember when I was 21 – I thought it was an awful time and we had Vietnam, and y'know, drug problems, and civil rights problems and everything seemed to be awful.\" The friend replied, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's different for you You were a kid in the fifties and everybody knows that nothing happened in the fifties\" Joel retorted, \"Wait a minute, didn't you hear of the Korean War or the Suez Canal Crisis?\" Joel later said those headlines formed the basic framework for the song.\n\nThe song was written in a relatively short period, with Joel explaining, \"I just started writing and the words just started coming out. It was like a stream-of-consciousness thing.\" The song's lyrics are a whirlwind tour of the 20th century, referencing figures and events from politics, music, art, literature, and popular culture.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nUpon its release, \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" was met with a mixed response. Some critics saw the song as a shallow exercise in name-dropping, while others praised its innovative approach to songwriting and its ability to capture the essence of the 20th century.\n\n**Music Video**\n\nThe music video for \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" was directed by Chris Blum and features a unique concept. The video begins with a newly married couple entering their 1940s-style kitchen, and shows events in their domestic life over the next four decades. The video depicts the couple's children and grandchildren growing up, the 1950s housewife burning dinner, a distraught 1960s housewife whose disinterested husband and children won't eat her cooking popping pills, the hippie counterculture children burning their bras and draft cards while smoking marijuana in the kitchen, and the eventual death of the family's father.\n\nThroughout the video, the passage of time is depicted by periodic redecoration and upgrades of the kitchen, while an unchanging Billy Joel looks on in the background. Joel is also shown banging on a table in front of a burning backdrop depicting various images that include the execution of Nguyễn Văn Lém and the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, among others.\n\n**Derivations**\n\nMany parodies and takeoffs have been based on the song, often expanding to events that have occurred since 1989. These parodies include The Simpsons' parody \"They'll Never Stop the Simpsons\" at the end of the 2002 \"Gump Roast\" episode, and the San Francisco a cappella group The Richter Scales' 2007 Webby Award-winning parody \"Here Comes Another Bubble.\"\n\n**Personnel**\n\nThe song features a distinctive vocal style, with Billy Joel delivering the lyrics at a rapid-fire pace. The song's arrangement is also notable, featuring a driving rhythm and a memorable melody. The song's production is credited to Billy Joel and Mick Guzauski.\n\n**Charts**\n\n\"We Didn't Start the Fire\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, staying at the top for four weeks. The song also reached number one on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.\n\n**Certifications**\n\n\"We Didn't Start the Fire\" has been certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating sales of over 1 million copies in the United States.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nIn 2021, a weekly podcast began, hosted by Katie Puckrik and Tom Fordyce, entitled We Didn't Start the Fire. Each week, they examine a subject mentioned in the Billy Joel song, in lyric order, and discuss its importance and cultural significance with an expert guest.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of songs by Billy Joel\n* Timeline of 20th century history\n* List of songs about historical events\n\n**References**\n\n* Joel, Billy.

The episode was written and directed by series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and is the first part of two specials that were produced as part of a $900 million deal with Comedy Central.\n\n**Plot**\n\nForty years into the future, the COVID-19 pandemic is waning. Stan Marsh has moved away from South Park, Colorado, and is employed as an online whiskey consultant. He lives with a sentient, nagging Amazon Alexa. Stan receives a call from Kyle Broflovski, now the guidance counselor at South Park Elementary, who informs him that Kenny McCormick, the show's fourth main character, has died.\n\nThe episode follows Stan as he returns to South Park to attend Kenny's funeral and pays his respects to his deceased friend. Upon his return, Stan is greeted by a dystopian South Park, where the once-quaint town has been overrun by consumerism and technology. The episode satirizes the excesses of modern society, with flying cars, geisha video billboards, and a culture of instant gratification.\n\nThroughout the episode, Stan grapples with the changing world and the loss of his friend. He is aided by his friends Cartman, Kyle, and Butters, who are all struggling to cope with the aftermath of the pandemic. As the episode progresses, Stan and his friends embark on a series of misadventures, including a visit to a group home for seniors, where they encounter a eccentric group of residents.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe episode features the voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Isaac Hayes, Mona Marshall, April Stewart, and Adrien Beard, among others. The episode marks the final appearance of Kenny McCormick, who was voiced by Matt Stone.\n\n**Production**\n\nSouth Park Studios, the production company for the series, closed when the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States began in March 2020, forcing the crew to work remotely. Trey Parker stated that the film is a made-for-TV film, and was not on a theatrical budget, an experiment he explained the production sought to continue, because \"We're at where a lot of people are at, which is the future kind of sucks We would like to get back to where each week we can do something totally different.\"\n\nThe episode was produced over a period of several months, with the cast and crew working remotely due to the pandemic. The episode was written and storyboarded by Parker and Stone, with the animation being handled by a team of artists and animators.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea for South Park: Post Covid began in 2020, when Parker and Stone were approached by Comedy Central with the idea of producing a series of specials. The two creators had been working on a number of projects, including a feature film, but ultimately decided to focus on the specials.\n\nThe episode was developed over a period of several months, with Parker and Stone working closely with the cast and crew to bring the story to life. The episode was shot on a relatively low budget, with a focus on creating a realistic and satirical take on the future.\n\n**Working process**\n\nThe working process for South Park: Post Covid was unique, given the circumstances of the pandemic. The cast and crew worked remotely, with Parker and Stone handling the writing and storyboarding from their homes. The animation was handled by a team of artists and animators, who worked on a freelance basis.\n\nThe episode was produced over a period of several months, with the cast and crew working in isolation due to the pandemic. The episode was edited and finalized by Parker and Stone, with the final product being screened for the cast and crew before its release.\n\n**References to popular culture**\n\nThe episode's depiction of the future as a dystopia overrun by consumerism, geisha video billboards and flying cars is a reference to Blade Runner. The movie also has references to The Godfather Part II and Beverly Hills Cop.\n\nThe episode's satire of modern society and technology is reminiscent of works such as 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The episode's use of satire and social commentary is a hallmark of the South Park franchise, and continues a long tradition of critiquing contemporary culture.\n\n**Reception**\n\nLiam Hoofe of Flickering Myth said of the episode \"In the end, South Park: Post COVID feels like it is setting the table for a more interesting feature a little later down the road The movie/TV special spends most of its runtime introducing us to the new world that the group now inhabits It has some really nice satirical touches and a lot of the Covid-related jokes land well.\"\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its satire and social commentary. The episode's use of humor and its willingness to tackle difficult subjects has been praised by many, and it is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of the South Park franchise.\n\n**See also**\n\n* South Park\n* Trey Parker\n* Matt Stone\n* Comedy Central\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* Future society\n* Satire\n* Social commentary\n\n**References**\n\n* \"South Park: Post Covid\".

markings on his forehead, in which he stated that he would confess to organizing \"mass unrest\" and that he did not have health problems, after unconfirmed reports of a heart condition [42]

journalist and opposition activist who has been involved in various high-profile incidents, including a forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and subsequent arrest. He has been a vocal critic of the Belarusian government and has been accused of having ties to extremist groups.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRoman Protasevich was born on May 5, 1995, in Minsk, Belarus. He moved to Poland in 2019, where he sought political asylum. Before his move to Poland, Protasevich had been involved in opposition activism in Belarus, participating in protests and advocating for democratic reforms.\n\n**Opposition Activism and Work in Belarus (2011-2019)**\n\nProtasevich's involvement in opposition activism began in the early 2010s, when he was detained several times by Belarusian authorities for participating in protests. Despite the risks, Protasevich continued to advocate for democratic reforms and human rights in Belarus. During this period, he worked as a journalist, covering social and political issues in Belarus.\n\n**Opposition Activism in Exile (2019-2021)**\n\nAfter moving to Poland in 2019, Protasevich continued to be involved in opposition activism, albeit from a distance. He became a vocal critic of the Belarusian government, using social media to express his views and advocate for democratic reforms. In January 2020, Protasevich announced that he had asked for political asylum in Poland.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nOn May 23, 2021, Protasevich was on board Ryanair Flight 4978, which was diverted to Minsk National Airport on the orders of Belarusian authorities. The flight was diverted after a false bomb threat was reported, and the passengers were subjected to a search. Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, were arrested upon arrival in Minsk.\n\n**Ryanair Flight 4978**\n\nThe diversion of Ryanair Flight 4978 was widely condemned by international authorities, with many viewing it as a brazen attempt by the Belarusian government to silence Protasevich. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched an investigation into the incident, which found that the Belarusian authorities had used a false bomb threat to divert the flight. The ICAO report concluded that the diversion was a violation of international aviation law.\n\n**Detention and Forced Confessions**\n\nAfter his arrest, Protasevich was subjected to intense pressure from Belarusian authorities, who attempted to extract a confession from him. In a video released by the Belarusian authorities, Protasevich appeared to be under duress, with dark markings on his forehead and a visible sense of distress. Protasevich's father and allies have since stated that the video was likely coerced, with Protasevich being subjected to physical and psychological pressure.\n\n**Trial and Subsequent Pardon**\n\nProtasevich's trial opened on February 16, 2023, with the journalist pleading guilty to the initial charges against him. During the trial, Protasevich expressed his willingness to face any outcome, but also criticized the Belarusian authorities for their actions against him. After his release, reports emerged that Protasevich had testified against Sapega in exchange for a reduced sentence or presidential pardon.\n\n**Release**\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Protasevich was released from prison, reportedly after serving a reduced sentence. The details of his release are still unclear, but it is believed that he was released in exchange for his testimony against Sapega.\n\n**Trivia**\n\nBelarusian media has accused Protasevich of fighting alongside the Ukrainian Azov Battalion, a far-right militia group. However, Protasevich has denied these allegations, stating that he was a freelance photojournalist covering the war in Donbas. Andriy Biletsky, the founder of the Azov Battalion, has since confirmed that Protasevich was indeed present in Ukraine during the conflict, but emphasized that he was not a member of the group.\n\nProtasevich's case has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from human rights groups and international authorities. His detention and forced confessions have been widely criticized, with many viewing the incident as a brazen attempt by the Belarusian government to silence a vocal critic.", "prompt": "Write a

cited by Reuters, upon hearing of the diversion to Minsk, Protasevich immediately gave some of his luggage to his girlfriend [32] In Minsk, Protasevich and his girlfriend were arrested at the passport control No bomb was found aboard [29] [30] [33] Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko's press service announced that he personally ordered the plane redirected to Minsk and sent a Belarusian Air Force MiG-29 fighter aircraft to escort it, [29] [34] [35] however subsequently the International Civil Aviation Organization fact-finding task force determined the MiG-29 was just tasked for communications back-up and did not contact, approach or escort the flight [36]\n\n\nRyanair Flight 4978\nOn 23 May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 (Athens–Vilnius), with Protasevich on board, received a false bomb threat [28] and was diverted by Belarusian air traffic control to Minsk National Airport [29] [30] While in Athens, Protasevich sent messages through Telegram saying he had seen a bald man at the airport following him and taking photographs of him [31] Minsk airport staff said they landed the plane due to a report of a bomb aboard Lithuanian airport authorities stated that they had not

escort the flight [36]\n\n\nDetention and forced confessions\nThe day after the forced Ryanair landing, Belarusian authorities issued a video in which Protasevich claimed he had been treated correctly and not been harmed, though he looked visibly stressed [41] There were dark markings on his forehead, in which he stated that he would confess to organizing \"mass unrest\" and that he did not have health problems, after unconfirmed reports of a heart condition [42] Protasevich's father said the video appeared forced and his nose seemed to have been broken, [43] while allies of Protasevich, including exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the video \"is how Roman looks under physical and moral pressure\" [44] The Viasna Human Rights Centre and other Belarusian human rights organizations named Protasevich a political prisoner in a joint statement and demanded his immediate release [45] Amnesty International called for the release of Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, saying \"their arrest is arbitrary and unlawful, and its circumstances are nothing short of horrifying.\" [46]\n\n\nTrial and subsequent pardon\nProtasevich pleaded guilty to the initial charges against him and his trial opened on 16 February 2023 [62] He was not put into a cage during the first hearing, as it is usual with defendants facing a trial, and he said that he was \"prepared to face any outcome.\" [63] When questioned for the other activists who left, Protasevich said that had he not been removed from the Ryanair flight, he would have never returned to Belarus, and added that \"no one  [of the exiled activists] in their right mind will come back.\" [62]\n\n\nRelease\nAfter his release, reports leaked that Protasevich testified against his former girlfriend Sapega in order to receive either a reduced sentence or a presidential pardon According to media, Protasevich's testimony against Sapega was handed to the Vladivostok authorities handling Sapega's prison transfer case [73] [74]\n\n\nTrivia\nBelarusian media accused Protasevich of fighting alongside the Ukrainian Azov Battalion [80] According to the BBC, the \"pro-Lukashenko press in Belarus has portrayed the dissident journalist as an extremist with right-wing sympathies\" [11] Protasevich said in 2020 that he had spent a year in Ukraine covering the war in Donbas as a freelance photojournalist [81] Azov Battalion founder Andriy Biletsky wrote about Protasevich, \"Roman was indeed together with Azov and other military units that fought against the occupation of Ukraine, though his weapon as a journalist wasn't an automatic rifle but the written word\", and that he was wounded at the 2015 Shyrokyne standoff [82] [83] [84]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

officer In the Russian Far East, he worked in the Olginsky district and the Suchan valley of Primorye At the end of 1919, Tryapitsyn was sent by the Military Revolutionary Staff of Red Army Partisan detachments and revolutionary organizations of Khabarovsk and Nikolaev districts to the lower reaches of the Amur River to organize an insurgency there There is a version that Tryapitsyn left with the

Tryapitsyn left with the detachment arbitrarily, dissatisfied with the passivity of Red Army Partisan command Nina Lebedeva-Kiyashko, an active Socialist-Revolutionaries-Maximalist from Blagoveshchensk, left with him as commissar [6]\n\n\nMarch\nThe town of Nikolaevsk-on-Amur was located some distance from the main events However, as part of the 1918 intervention, a Japanese garrison was stationed there because of the city's strategic location at the mouth of the Amur River, opposite Sakhalin Island In addition, Nikolaevsk-on-Amur had been a gold mining center since the late 19th century In addition to the small garrison stationed there in 1918, Japanese citizens, including the consul and his family, lived in the town [2]\n\n\nApril and May\nOn April 4 and 5, 1920, the Japanese troops launched an all-out attack against the Bolsheviks in the Russian Far East General Ōi Shigemoto led an all-out attack against the Bolsheviks One of the factors that influenced Oi's decision was the Nikolayevsk-on-Amu clashed in March 1920 At that time, Japanese troops clashed with guerrillas commanded by Iakov Triapitsyn(who were Russian, Chinese and Koreans) And In addition, the Japanese government was at that time ordering the Japanese military to stop the ongoing guerrilla struggle of the Koreans in the Russian Far East While attacking the local Bolsheviks, the Japanese captured many Korean politicians and fighters And according to Bolshevik Petr Mikhailovich Nikiforov (who was in charge of the economic part of the Vladivostok coalition government), The actions of groups opposed to the buffer state in Vladivostok led to a full-scale attack by Japanese forces According to Dr Ivan Sablin, the extent to which Tokyo directed these attacks is unclear However, the occupation of northern Sakhalin in the summer of 1920 was authorized by the Japanese government in retaliation for the Nikolayevsk-on-Amur massacre According to Dr Ivan Sablin, the extent to which Tokyo directed these attacks is unclear However, the occupation of northern Sakhalin in the summer of 1920 was authorized by the Japanese government in retaliation for the Nikolayevsk-on-Amur massacre [11]\n\n\nAfter the devastation of Nikolayevsk-on-Amur\nThe Red Terror did not stop with the destruction of Nikolayevsk Civilian massacres took place during a march of several days through the taiga of nine thousand forcibly evacuated townspeople, when Red Army partisans, according to the memory of G.G Milovanov, \"rode on people on horseback,\" and weakened women and children were killed on the spot Another eyewitness recalled: \"Terrible atrocities were committed in Kerby Armed men came at night and told us to evacuate People were picked up and taken out of the village No one came back Without rifle fire, everyone was cut down with sabres Bodies were floating down the river\" Many bodies floated down the Amgun: \"Women, children, and seldom men floated with cut off ears, noses, severed fingers, with slashed, stabbed bayonet wounds It was forbidden to bury them.\" [6] [4]\n\n\nWartime sexual violence\nIn Nikolayevsk, there was also brutal wartime sexual violence Wartime sexual violence in the Russian Civil War had a cultural component Traditionally, a conquering warrior had the right to rape the defeated [16] Irregular units were characterized by an increased propensity to violence of all kinds during the civil war Some ethnographic peculiarities of the Trans-Ural peasants also contributed to the rampant sexual crime It is known that in the Siberian village, there was an ancient custom among young people of gang rape of girls Lack of respect for women and promiscuity of morals combined with class hatred bore their fruits During the guerrilla years, mass rape was an omnipresent, grim reality The rebels, who considered all women their legitimate prey, raped the wives of priests, civil servants, officers, and merchants, as well as nuns and teachers, but occasionally they willingly pounced on peasant women from neighboring villages [16] Mass rapes were characterized by the adventures of Y Tryapitsyn's detachments (Sakhalin region), whose headquarters became the centers of mass rapes The places of wartime sexual violence were the headquarters and Red Army partisans of Tryapitsyn Tryapitsyn's unit in the captured village, accustomed to wartime rape, violated human rights Tryapitsyn's unit in the captured village of Susanino herded all the girls into one room and raped them, then tried to burn their victims alive, but were repelled by other Red Army partisans [16]\n\n\nReactions from Chinese troops\nOn May 2, the commander of the Soviet Russian army, Yakov Triapitsyn, Triapitsyn's aide, and others came to the Chinese consulate to ask the consulate and Captain Mao Chuicai毛锤才 of the Li Sui for help Captain Mao Chuicai refused Yakov Triapitsyn's request, but Yakov Triapitsyn threatened to destroy the entire village and expel the Chinese from Nikolayevsk-on-Amur if China did not provide assistance Consul General Zhang Wenhuan张文焕 and Captain Mao Chuicai had asked Yakov Triapitsyn not to torture the Japanese and to guarantee their lives in accordance with international law Yakov Triapitsyn promised not to harm the prisoners, but Mao Chuicai and Zhang Wenhuan did not believe Triapitsyn's promise Chuicai and Wenhuan requested a meeting with Triapitsyn to ensure the safety of the prisoners, but he refused to meet with them Eventually, Triapitsyn broke his promise On May 26, Triapitsyn burned the entire village and massacred not only the Japanese prisoners but also 4,000 Russians [8]\n\n\nCriminal trials\nNot far from the city, in the town of Kerbi, an uprising broke out In a sudden raid by a Red Army partisans led by the chief of the regional police, I T Andreev, on the night of July 4, Tryapitsyn, along with 450 associates, were captured without resistance A few days later, the felons in Tryapitsyn's unit as the by a hastily assembled 103-member court of Red Army partisans and local residents Tryapitsyn was arrested, convicted, and executed on 9 July 1920, for the crime of undermining the confidence of the working people in the Communist regime [2] [15]\n\n\nAfter the massacre\nIn the end, this gave Japan a pretext for a major armed intervention in Russian affairs (Japanese intervention throughout the Russian Far East, Japanese occupation of northern Sakhalin), although earlier, on 4 February 1920, the Japanese command had declared neutrality and on 17 February had begun to evacuate its troops from Russian territory [10]\n\n\nGradual withdrawal of Japanese forces\nIn the end, this gave Japan a pretext for a major armed intervention in Russian affairs (Japanese intervention throughout the Russian Far East, Japanese occupation of northern Sakhalin), although earlier, on 4 February 1920, the Japanese command had declared neutrality and on 17 February had begun to evacuate its troops from Russian territory [10]\n\n\nJapanese occupation of Nikolaevsk-on-Amur\nIn mid-November 1921, the security officers of the DVR reported that \"the Japanese are beginning to construct buildings in Nikolaevsk, and a large merchant SIMADO is building an Orthodox church.\" From the intelligence report of the DNRA headquarters of the DVR dated 3 August 1922, addressed to the GPU of the RSFSR, it follows that on July 15, the headquarters of the Japanese regiment stationed in Nikolaevsk-on-Amur received an order from the divisional headquarters to prepare for evacuation, in connection with which \"the construction of houses  [in] Nikolaevsk by the Japanese has been stopped.\" [17]\n\n\nTryapitsyn's bandits\nSome of Tryapitsyn's bandits remained in the region's power structures, which caused some concern among the DVR leadership On 6 June 1921, the Dalbureau of the Central Committee of the RCP (b) decided to dismiss Vasily Ganimedov from the post of head of the Amguno-Kerbinsky district \"as a ragamuffin.\" And in the fall of 1922, in the production of the Investigative Department of the Main Military Court of the NVRA and the Fleet of the DVR, was the case of the former chief of staff of the Military Commissioner of the Amguno-Kerbinsky mining district, P.G Tenterev, accused of underreporting and complicity in the crimes of V Ganimedov (Ganimedov himself, on 1 August 1922, was under arrest in the Military Department of the GPO of the DVR) However, at the same time, Tenterev was released on the surety of some high-ranking person [15]\n\n\nthe protagonists of the trial\nSome of the protagonists of the trial were forced to flee Russia I.T Andreev went to Japan and China, and A.Z Ovchinnikov went to the United States [15]\n\n\nNumber of victims\nThe chairman of the Sakhalin People's Revolutionary Committee, G.Z Prokopenko, wrote in late 1920 to the DVR government that \"half of the region has been destroyed and half of the population wiped out and driven under the ice by the partisans.\" [3]\n\n\nTies of the perpetrators to the Soviet government\nIn Soviet historiography, Tryapitsyn was often described as an anti-Soviet bandit, but the Nikolayevskaya Commune \"represents the apotheosis of the Soviet regime through the savage beating of thousands of innocent people, including infants, by the most ingenious tortures of Bolshevik executioners\" [6]\n\n\nHistoriography\n\"Today, many historians agree in the description of Tryapitsyn's actions as unprecedented, baseless cruelty: \"the intentional burning of an entire city, killing thousands killed with immeasurable ruins and devastation of the territory that had no parallels in thehistory of that war\" (Nelyubova 2012, 291).\n\nIn popular culture\nAt the time of the massacre, Japan emphasized and exaggerated the Japanese victims, but the majority of those killed by the Tryapitsyn units were Russians, not Japanese However, Japan's misleading propaganda omitted thousands of Russians who made up the bulk of the victims massacred by the Red Army [5]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Nikolayevsk Incident**\n\nThe Nikolayevsk Incident

of the trial were forced to flee Russia I.T Andreev went to Japan and China, and A.Z Ovchinnikov went to the United States [15]\n\n\nNumber of victims\nThe chairman of the Sakhalin People's Revolutionary Committee, G.Z Prokopenko, wrote in late 1920 to the DVR government that \"half of the region has been destroyed and half of the population wiped out and driven under the ice by the partisans.\" [3]\n\n\nTies of the perpetrators to the Soviet government\nIn Soviet historiography, Tryapitsyn was often described as an anti-Soviet bandit, but the Nikolayevskaya Commune \"represents the apotheosis of the Soviet regime through the savage beating of thousands of innocent people, including infants, by the most ingenious tortures of Bolshevik executioners\" [6]\n\n\nHistoriography\n\"Today, many historians agree in the description of Tryapitsyn's actions as unprecedented, baseless cruelty: \"the intentional burning of an entire city, killing thousands killed with immeasurable ruins and devastation of the territory that had no parallels in thehistory of that war\" (Nelyubova 2012, 291).\n\nIn popular culture\nAt the time of the massacre, Japan emphasized and exaggerated the Japanese victims, but the majority of those killed by the Tryapitsyn units were Russians, not Japanese However, Japan's misleading propaganda omitted thousands of Russians who made up the bulk of the victims massacred by the Red Army [5]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Temple_Mount", "content": "\nTerminology\nThe name of the site is disputed, primarily between Muslims and Jews, in the context of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict Some Arab-Muslim commentators and scholars attempt to deny Jewish connection with the Temple Mount, while some Jewish commentators and scholars attempt to belittle the importance of the site in Islam [36] [37] During a 2016 dispute over the name of the site, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova stated: \"Different peoples worship the same places, sometimes under different names The recognition, use of and respect for these names is paramount.\" [38]\n\n\nTemple Mount\nThe term Har haBayīt – commonly translated as \"Temple Mount\" in English – was first used in the books of Micah (4:1) and Jeremiah (26:18), literally as \"Mount of the House\", a literary variation of the longer phrase \"Mountain of the House of the Lord\" The abbreviation was not used again in the later books of the Hebrew Bible [39] or in the New Testament [40] The term remained in use throughout the Second Temple period, although the term “Mount Zion”, which today refers to the eastern hill of ancient Jerusalem, was used more frequently Both terms are in use in the Book of Maccabees [41] The term Har haBayīt is used throughout the Mishnah and later Talmudic texts [42] [43]\n\n\nOther Hebrew terms\n2 Chronicles 3:1 [47] refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as Mount Moriah (Hebrew: הַר הַמֹּורִיָּה, har ha-Môriyyāh).\n\n\nAl-Aqsa Mosque\nThe English term \"al-Aqsa Mosque\" is a translation of either al-Masjid al-'Aqṣā (Arabic: ٱلْمَسْجِد ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ) or al-Jâmi' al-Aqṣā (Arabic: ٱلْـجَـامِـع الْأَقْـصّى) [56] [57] [58] Al-Masjid al-'Aqṣā – \"the farthest mosque\" – is derived from the Quran's Surah 17 (\"The Night Journey\") which writes that Muhammad travelled from Mecca to the mosque, from where he subsequently ascended to Heaven [59] [60] Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer Al-Maqdisi, [61] 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, [61] 12th-century geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi [62] and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, [63] [64] as well as 19th century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, [56] Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza which is the subject of this article – the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written [57] [65] [66]\n\n\nHaram al-Sharif\nDuring the period of Mamluk [74] (1260–1517) and Ottoman rule (1517–1917), the wider compound began to also be popularly known as the Haram al-Sharif, or al-Ḥaram ash-Sharīf (Arabic: اَلْـحَـرَم الـشَّـرِيْـف), which translates as the \"Noble Sanctuary\" It mirrors the terminology of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca; [75] [76] [77] [78] This term elevated the compound to the status of Haram, which had previously been reserved for the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina Other Islamic figures disputed the haram status of the site [73] Usage of the name Haram al-Sharif by local Palestinians has waned in recent decades, in favor of the traditional name of Al-Aqsa Mosque [73]\n\n\nJerusalem's sacred esplanade\nSome scholars have used the terms Sacred Esplanade or Holy Esplanade as a \"strictly neutral term\" for the site [5] [6] A notable example of this usage is the 2009 work Where Heaven and Earth Meet: Jerusalem's Sacred Esplanade, written as a joint undertaking by 21 Jewish, Muslim and Christian scholars [79] [80]\n\n\nJerusalem's Holy Esplanade\nIn recent years, the term \"Holy Esplanade\" has been used by the United Nations, by its Secretary-General and by the UN's subsidiary organs [81]\n\n\nLocation and dimensions\nThe Temple Mount forms the northern portion of a narrow spur of hill that slopes sharply downward from north to south Rising above the Kidron Valley to the east and Tyropoeon Valley to the west, [82] its peak reaches a height of 740 m (2,428 ft) above sea level [83] In around 19 BCE, Herod the Great extended the Mount's natural plateau by enclosing the area with four massive retaining walls and filling the voids This artificial expansion resulted in a large flat expanse which today forms the eastern section of the Old City of Jerusalem The trapezium shaped platform measures 488 m (1,601 ft) along the west, 470 m (1,540 ft) along the east, 315 m (1,033 ft) along the north and 280 m (920 ft) along the south, giving a total area of approximately 150,000 m2 (37 acres) [84] The northern wall of the Mount, together with the northern section of the western wall, is hidden behind residential buildings The southern section of the western flank is revealed and contains what is known as the Western Wall The retaining walls on these two sides descend many meters below ground level A northern portion of the western wall may be seen from within the Western Wall Tunnel, which was excavated through buildings adjacent to the platform On the southern and eastern sides, the walls are visible almost to their full height The platform itself is separated from the rest of the Old City by the Tyropoeon Valley, though this once deep valley is now largely hidden beneath later deposits and is imperceptible in places The platform can be reached via Gate of the Chain Street – a street in the Muslim Quarter at the level of the platform, actually sitting on a monumental bridge; [85] [better source needed] the bridge is no longer externally visible due to the change in ground level, but it can be seen from beneath via the Western Wall Tunnel [86]\n\n\nHeritage site\nIn 1980, Jordan proposed that the Old City be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site [87] and it was added to the List in 1981 [88] In 1982, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger [89]\n\n\nReligious significance\nThe Temple Mount has historical and religious significance for all three of the major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam It has particular religious significance for Judaism and Islam.\n\n\nJudaism\nThe Temple Mount is considered the holiest site in Judaism [101] [102] [11] According to Jewish tradition, both Temples stood at the Temple Mount [103] Jewish tradition further places the Temple Mount as the location for a number of important events which occurred in the Bible, including the Binding of Isaac, Jacob's dream, and the prayer of Isaac and Rebekah [104] According to the Talmud, the Foundation Stone is the place from where the world was created and expanded into its current form [105] [106] Orthodox Jewish tradition maintains it is here that the third and final Temple will be built when the Messiah comes [107]\n\n\nThe Temple\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the Temple Mount was originally a threshing-floor owned by Araunah, a Jebusite [111] The Bible narrates how David united the twelve Israelite tribes, conquered Jerusalem and brought the Israelites' central artifact, the Ark of the Covenant, into the city [112] When a great plague struck Israel, a destroying angel appeared on Araunah's threshing floor The prophet Gad then suggested the area to David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to Yawheh [113] David bought the property from Araunah, for fifty pieces of silver, and erected the altar God answered his prayers and stopped the plague David subsequently chose the site for a future temple to replace the Tabernacle and house the Ark of the Covenant; [114] [115] God forbade him from building it, however, because he had \"shed much blood\" [116]\n\n\nIn prophecy\nThe Book of Isaiah foretells the international importance of the Temple Mount:\n\n\nBinding of Isaac\nIn Jewish tradition, the Temple Mount is also believed to be the location of Abraham's binding of Isaac 2 Chronicles 3:1 [47] refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as Mount Moriah (Hebrew: הַר הַמֹּורִיָּה, har ha-Môriyyā) The \"land of Moriah\" (אֶרֶץ הַמֹּרִיָּה, ereṣ ha-Môriyyā) is the name given by Genesis to the location of the binding of Isaac [125] Since at least the first century CE, the two sites have been identified with one another in Judaism, this identification being subsequently perpetuated by Jewish and Christian tradition Modern scholarship tends to regard them as distinct (see Moriah).\n\n\nCreation of the world\nAccording to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the Talmud, the Foundation Stone, which sits below the Dome of the Rock, was the spot from where the world was created and expanded into its current form, [105] [106] and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human, Adam [125]\n\n\nThird Temple\nJewish texts predict that the Mount will be the site of a Third and final Temple, which will be rebuilt with the coming of the Messiah The rebuilding of the Temple remained a recurring theme among generations, particularly in thrice daily Amidah (Standing prayer), central prayer of the Jewish liturgy, which contains a plea for the building of a Third Temple and the restoration of sacrificial services A number of vocal Jewish groups now advocate building the Third Temple without delay in order to bring to pass God's \"end-time prophetic plans for Israel and the entire world.\" [126]\n\n\nChristianity\nThe Temple was of central importance in Jewish worship in the Tanakh (Old Testament) In the New Testament, Herod's Temple was the site of several events in the life of Jesus, and Christian loyalty to the site as a focal point remained long after his death [127] [128] [129] After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, which came to be regarded by early Christians, as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud, to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people, [130] [131] the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship with the Christians considering it a fulfillment of Christ's prophecy at, for example, Matthew 23:38 [132] and Matthew 24:2 [133] It was to this end, proof of a biblical prophecy fulfilled and of Christianity's victory over Judaism with the New Covenant, [134] that early Christian pilgrims also visited the site [135] Byzantine Christians, despite some signs of constructive work on the esplanade, [136] generally neglected the Temple Mount, especially when a Jewish attempt to rebuild the Temple was destroyed by the earthquake of 363 [137] It became a desolate local rubbish dump, perhaps outside the city limits, [138] as Christian worship in Jerusalem shifted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and Jerusalem's centrality was replaced by Rome [139]\n\n\nIslam\nAmong both Sunni and Shia Muslims, [citation needed] the entire plaza, known as the al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as Haram al-Sharif or \"the Noble Sanctuary\", is considered the third holiest site in Islam [24] According to Islamic tradition, the plaza is the location of Muhammad's ascension to heaven from Jerusalem, and served as the first \"qibla\", the direction Muslims turn towards when praying As in Judaism, Muslims also associate the site with Abraham, and other prophets who are also venerated in Islam [27] Muslims view the site as being one of the earliest and most noteworthy places of worship of God They preferred to use the esplanade as the heart for the Muslim quarter, since it had been abandoned by Christians, to avoid disturbing the Christian quarters of Jerusalem [144] Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of al-Aqsa Mosque on the site, including the shrine known as the \"Dome of the Rock\" [145] The Dome was completed in 692 CE, making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world The Al-Aqsa Mosque, sometimes known as the Qibli Mosque, rest on the far southern side of the Mount, facing Mecca.\n\n\nIn early Islam\nEarly Islam regarded the Foundation Stone as the location of Solomon's Temple, and the first architectural initiatives on the Temple Mount sought to glorify Jerusalem by presenting Islam as a continuation of Judaism and Christianity [36] Almost immediately after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE, Caliph 'Omar ibn al Khatab, reportedly disgusted by the filth covering the site, had it thoroughly cleaned, [146] and granted Jews access to the site [147] According to early Quranic interpreters and what is generally accepted as Islamic tradition, in 638 CE Umar, upon entering a conquered Jerusalem, consulted with Ka'ab al-Ahbar – a Jewish convert to Islam who came with him from Medina – as to where the best spot would be to build a mosque Al-Ahbar suggested to him that it should be behind the Rock \"... so that all of Jerusalem would be before you.\" Umar replied, \"You correspond to Judaism!\" Immediately after this conversation, Umar began to clean up the site – which was filled with trash and debris – with his cloak, and other Muslim followers imitated him until the site was clean Umar then prayed at the spot where it was believed that Muhammad had prayed before his night journey, reciting the Quranic sura Sad [148] Thus, according to this tradition, Umar thereby reconsecrated the site as a mosque [149]\n\n\nIsra and Mi'raj\nAccording to the Qur'an, Muhammad was transported to a site named Al-Aqsa Mosque – \"the furthest place of prayer\" (al-Masjid al-'Aqṣā) during his Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) [159] The Qur'an describes how Muhammad was taken by the miraculous steed Buraq from the Great Mosque of Mecca to al-Aqsa Mosque where he prayed [160] [159] [161] After Muhammad finished his prayers, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) traveled with him to heaven, where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer: [162] [163] [164]\n\n\nFirst qibla\nThe historical significance of al-Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al-Aqsa when they prayed for a period of 16 or 17 months after migration to Medina in 624; it thus became the qibla (\"direction\") that Muslims faced for prayer [178] Muhammad later prayed towards the Kaaba in Mecca after receiving a revelation during a prayer session [179] [180] in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn [181] [182] The qibla was relocated to the Kaaba where Muslims have been directed to pray ever since [183]\n\n\nReligious status\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation refers to al-Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam (and calls for Arab sovereignty over it) [184]\n\n\nHistory\nThe hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE [citation needed] An amulet bearing the cartouche of Thutmose III (r 1479–1425 BCE) was discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project at the site in 2012 [185]\n\n\nPre-Israelite\nThe hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE [citation needed] An amulet bearing the cartouche of Thutmose III (r 1479–1425 BCE) was discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project at the site in 2012 [185]\n\n\nIsraelite period\nAccording to archeologists, the Temple Mount served as the center of the religious life of biblical Jerusalem as well as the royal acropolis of the Kingdom of Judah [186] The First Temple is believed to have once been a part of a much larger royal complex [187] The Bible also mentions several other buildings constructed by Solomon at the site, including the royal palace, the \"House of the Lebanon Forest\", the \"Hall of Pillars\", the \"Hall of Throne\" and the \"House of Pharaoh's Daughter\" [41] [188] Some scholars believe that, in accordance with biblical accounts, the royal and religious compound on the Temple Mount was built by Solomon during the 10th century BCE as a separate entity, which was later incorporated into the city [186] Knauf argued that the Temple Mount already served as the cultic and governmental center of Jerusalem as early as in the Late Bronze Age [189] Alternatively, Na'aman suggested that Solomon built the Temple on a much smaller scale than the one described in the Bible, which was enlarged or rebuilt during the 8th century BCE [190] In 2014, Finkelstein, Koch and Lipschits proposed that the tell of ancient Jerusalem lies beneath the modern-day compound, rather than the nearby archeological site known as the City of David, as mainstream archaeology believes; [191] however, this proposal was rejected by other scholars of the subject [192]\n\n\nPersian, Hellenistic and Hasmonean periods\nConstruction of the Second Temple began under Cyrus in around 538 BCE and was completed in 516 BCE It was built at the original site of Solomon's Temple [197] [41]\n\n\nHerodian and early Roman periods\nAround 19 BCE, Herod the Great further expanded the Temple Mount and rebuilt the temple The ambitious project, which involved the employment of 10,000 workers, [201] more than doubled the size of the Temple Mount to approximately 36 acres (150,000 m2) Herod leveled the area by cutting away rock on the northwest side and raising the sloping ground to the south He achieved this by constructing huge buttress walls and vaults and filling the necessary sections with earth and rubble [202] The result was the largest temenos in the ancient world [203]\n\n\nMiddle Roman period\nThe city of Aelia Capitolina was built in 130 CE by the Roman emperor Hadrian and occupied by a Roman colony on the site of Jerusalem, which was still in ruins from the First Jewish Revolt in 70 CE Aelia came from Hadrian's nomen gentile, Aelius, while Capitolina meant that the new city was dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom a temple was built overlapping the site of the former second Jewish temple, the Temple Mount [210]\n\n\nLate Roman period\nFrom the first through the seventh centuries Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, gradually became the predominant religion of Palestine and under the Byzantines Jerusalem itself was almost completely Christian, with most of the population being Jacobite Christians of the Syrian rite [134] [137]\n\n\nByzantine period\nDuring his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns inside al-Aqsa mosque, but did not publish them [220] The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a known Umayyad mosaic [220]\n\n\nSassanid period\nIn 610, the Sassanid Empire drove the Byzantine Empire out of the Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem for the first time in centuries The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth which lasted for five years Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal sacrifice for the first time since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice and turned it into a garbage dump, [221] which is what it was when the Rashidun Caliph Umar took the city in 637.\n\n\nEarly Muslim period\nIn 637, Arabs besieged and captured the city from the Byzantine Empire, which had defeated the Persian forces and their allies, and reconquered the city There are no contemporary records, but many traditions, about the origin of the main Islamic buildings on the mount [222] [223] A popular account from later centuries is that the Rashidun Caliph Umar was led to the place reluctantly by the Christian patriarch Sophronius [224] He found it covered with rubbish, but the sacred Rock was found with the help of a converted Jew, Ka'b al-Ahbar [224] Al-Ahbar advised Umar to build a mosque to the north of the rock, so that worshippers would face both the rock and Mecca, but instead Umar chose to build it to the south of the rock [224] It became known as al-Aqsa Mosque According to Muslim sources, Jews participated in the construction of the haram, laying the groundwork for both al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock mosques [225] The first known eyewitness testimony is that of the pilgrim Arculf who visited about 670 According to Arculf's account as recorded by Adomnán, he saw a rectangular wooden house of prayer built over some ruins, large enough to hold 3,000 people [222] [226]\n\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid period\nThe Crusader period began in 1099 with the First Crusade's capture of Jerusalem After the city's conquest, the Crusading order known as the Knights Templar was granted use of Al-Aqsa Mosque to use as their headquarters This was probably by Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem at the Council of Nablus in January 1120 [229] The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what were believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon [230] [231] The Crusaders therefore referred to al-Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and it was from this location that the new Order took the name of \"Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon\", or \"Templar\" knights.\n\n\nMamluk period\nThere are several Mamluk buildings on and around the Haram esplanade, such as the late 15th-century al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa and Sabil (fountain) of Qaytbay The Mamluks also raised the level of Jerusalem's Central or Tyropoean Valley bordering the Temple Mount from the west by constructing huge substructures, on which they then built on a large scale The Mamluk-period substructures and over-ground buildings are thus covering much of the Herodian western wall of the Temple Mount.\n\n\nOttoman period\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Ottoman authorities continued the policy of prohibiting non-Muslims from setting foot on the Temple Mount until the early 19th century, when non-Muslims were again permitted to visit the site [232] [better source needed]\n\n\nBritish Mandatory period\nBetween 1922 and 1924, the Dome of the Rock was restored by the Islamic Higher Council [233] The Zionist movement at the time was strongly opposed to any notion that the Temple itself might be rebuilt Indeed, its armed wing, the Haganah militia, assassinated a Jewish man when his plan to blow up the Islamic sites on the Haram came to their attention in 1931 [234]\n\n\nJordanian period\nJordan undertook two renovations of the Dome of the Rock, replacing the leaking, wooden inner dome with an aluminum dome in 1952, and, when the new dome leaked, carrying out a second restoration between 1959 and 1964 [233]\n\n\nIsraeli period\nOn 7 June 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israeli forces advanced beyond the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line into West Bank territories, taking control of the Old City of Jerusalem, inclusive of the Temple Mount.\n\n\nStatus quo\nJews were not allowed to visit for approximately one thousand years [when?] [255]\n\n\nUnder Muslim control\nJews were not allowed to visit for approximately one thousand years [when?] [255]\n\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the first ten years of British rule in Palestine, all were allowed entry to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif complex Sometimes violence broke out at the entrance between Jews and Muslims During the 1929 Palestine riots, Jews were accused of violating the status quo [256] [257] Following the riots, the Supreme Muslim Council and the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf prohibited Jews from entering the site's gates During the mandate period, Jewish leaders celebrated ancient religious practices at the Western Wall The ban on visitors continued until 1948 [258]\n\n\nJordanian control\nAlthough the 1949 Armistice Agreement called for \"resumption of the normal functioning of the cultural and humanitarian institutions on Mount Scopus and free access thereto; free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\", in practice, wire and concrete barriers were the reality Cultural and religious sites in both sides of the city were destroyed and neglected and the Jewish community barred from its sacred places [259]\n\n\nUnder Israeli control\nA few days after the Six-Day War, on June 17, 1967, a meeting was held at the al-Aqsa mosque between Moshe Dayan and Muslim religious authorities of Jerusalem reformulating the status quo [260] Jews were given the right to visit the Temple Mount unobstructed and free of charge if they respected Muslims' religious feelings and acted decently, but they were not allowed to pray The Western Wall was to remain the Jewish place of prayer 'Religious sovereignty' was to remain with the Muslims while 'overall sovereignty' became Israeli [238] The Muslims objected to Dayan's offer, as they completely rejected the Israeli conquest of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount Some Jews, led by Shlomo Goren, then the military chief rabbi, had objected as well, claiming the decision handed over the complex to the Muslims, since the Western Wall's holiness is derived from the Mount and symbolizes exile, while praying on the Mount symbolizes freedom and the return of the Jewish people to their homeland [260] The President of the High Court of Justice, Aharon Barak, in response to an appeal in 1976 against police interference with an individual's putative right to prayer on the site, expressed the view that, while Jews had a right to prayer there, it was not absolute but subject to the public interest and the rights of other groups Israel's courts have considered the issue as one beyond their remit, and, given the delicacy of the matter, under political jurisdiction [260] Barak wrote:\n\n\nManagement and access\nAn Islamic Waqf has managed the Temple Mount continuously since the Muslim reconquest of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187 On June 7, 1967, soon after Israel had taken control of the area during the Six-Day War, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol assured that \"no harm whatsoever shall come to the places sacred to all religions\" Together with the extension of Israeli jurisdiction and administration over east Jerusalem, the Knesset passed the Preservation of the Holy Places Law, [269] ensuring protection of the Holy Places against desecration, as well as freedom of access thereto [270] The site remains within the area controlled by the State of Israel, with administration of the site remaining in the hands of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.\n\n\nJewish attitudes towards entering the site\nDue to religious restrictions on entering the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount (see following section), the Western Wall, a retaining wall for the Temple Mount and remnant of the Second Temple structure, is considered by some rabbinical authorities to be the holiest accessible site for Jews to pray A 2013 Knesset committee hearing considered allowing Jews to pray at the site, amidst heated debate Arab-Israeli MPs were ejected for disrupting the hearing, after shouting at the chairman, calling her a \"pyromaniac\" Religious Affairs Minister Eli Ben-Dahan of Jewish Home said his ministry was seeking legal ways to enable Jews to pray at the site [278]\n\n\nJewish religious law concerning entry to the site\nDuring Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of purity laws Persons suffering from corpse uncleanness were not allowed to enter the inner court [279] Non-Jews were also prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple [280] A hewn stone measuring 60 cm × 90 cm (24 in × 35 in) and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:\n\n\nOpinions of contemporary rabbis concerning entry to the site\nA few hours after the Temple Mount came under Israeli control during the Six-Day War, a message from the Chief Rabbis of Israel, Isser Yehuda Unterman and Yitzhak Nissim was broadcast, warning that Jews were not permitted to enter the site [285] This warning was reiterated by the Council of the Chief Rabbinate a few days later, which issued an explanation written by Rabbi Bezalel Jolti (Zolti) that \"Since the sanctity of the site has never ended, it is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount until the Temple is built.\" [285] The signatures of more than 300 prominent rabbis were later obtained [286]\n\n\nFeatures\nThe large courtyard (sahn) [25] can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world [23]\n\n\nCourtyard\nThe large courtyard (sahn) [25] can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world [23]\n\n\nUpper platform\nThe upper platform surrounds the Dome of the Rock, beneath which lies the Well of Souls, originally accessible only by a narrow hole in the Sakhrah, the foundation stone on which the Dome of the Rock site and after which it is named, until the Crusaders dug a new entrance to the cave from the south [298] The platform is accessible via eight staircases, each of which is topped by a free-standing arcade known in Arabic as the qanatir or mawazin The arcades were erected in different periods from the 10th to 15th centuries [299]\n\n\nLower platform\nThe lower platform – which constitutes most of the surface of the Temple Mount – has at its southern end al-Aqsa Mosque, which takes up most of the width of the Mount Gardens take up the eastern and most of the northern side of the platform; the far north of the platform houses an Islamic school [309]\n\n\nGates\nThe retaining walls of the platform contain several gateways, all now blocked In the eastern wall is the Golden Gate, through which legend states the Jewish Messiah would enter Jerusalem On the southern face are the Hulda Gates – the triple gate (which has three arches) and the double gate (which has two arches and is partly obscured by a Crusader building); these were the entrance and exit (respectively) to the Temple Mount from Ophel (the oldest part of Jerusalem), and the main access to the Mount for ordinary Jews In the western face, near the southern corner, is the Barclay's Gate – only half visible due to a building (the \"house of Abu Sa'ud\") on the northern side Also in the western face, hidden by later construction but visible via the recent Western Wall Tunnels, and only rediscovered by Warren, is Warren's Gate; the function of these western gates is obscure, but many Jews view Warren's Gate as particularly holy, due to its location due west of the Dome of the Rock The current location of the Dome of the Rock is considered one of the possible locations where the Holy of Holies was placed; numerous alternative opinions exist, based on study and calculations, such as those of Tuvia Sagiv.\n\n\nSolomon's Stables/Marwani Mosque\nEast of and joined to the triple gate passageway is a large vaulted area, supporting the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform – which is substantially above the bedrock at this point – the vaulted chambers here are popularly referred to as Solomon's Stables [317] They were used as stables by the Crusaders, but were built by Herod the Great – along with the platform they were built to support.\n\n\nNorthern and western porticos\nThe complex is bordered on the south and east by the outer walls of the Old City of Jerusalem On the north and west it is bordered by two long porticos (riwaq), built during the Mamluk period [318] A number of other structures were also built along these areas, mainly also from the Mamluk period On the north side, they include the Isardiyya Madrasa, built before 1345, and the Almalikiyya Madrasa, dated to 1340 [319] On the west side, they include the Ashrafiyya Madrasa, built by Sultan Qaytbay between 1480 and 1482, [320] and the adjacent Uthmaniyya Madrasa, dated to 1437 [321] The Sabil of Qaytbay, contemporary with the Ashrafiyya Madrasa, also stands nearby [320]\n\n\nMinarets\nThe existing four minarets include three along the western perimeter of the esplanade and one along the northern wall The earliest dated minaret was constructed on the northwest corner of the Temple Mount in 1298, with three other minarets added over the course of the 14th century [322] [323]\n\n\nArchaeology, site alterations\nDue to the extreme political sensitivity of the site, no real archaeological excavations have ever been conducted on the Temple Mount itself Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects near the Mount This sensitivity has not, however, protected both Jewish and Muslim works from accusations of destroying archeological evidence on a number of occasions [324] [325] [326] Aside from visual observation of surface features, most other archaeological knowledge of the site comes from the 19th-century survey carried out by Charles Wilson and Charles Warren and others Since the Waqf is granted almost full autonomy on the Islamic holy sites, Israeli archaeologists have been prevented from inspecting the area, and are restricted to conducting excavations around the Temple Mount.\n\n\nNoteworthy events\nGates1 Jaffa 2 Zion 3 Dung 4 Golden 5 Lions 6 Herod7 Damascus 8 New (Double, Single, Tanners')Al-Mawazin\n\n\nPanorama\nGates1 Jaffa 2 Zion 3 Dung 4 Golden 5 Lions 6

is considered holy by Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It is situated at the southern end of the Temple Mount esplanade, which is the site of several important structures, including the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Temple Mount has a long and complex history, dating back to ancient times. It was the site of the First Temple, built by King Solomon in the 10th century BCE, and the Second Temple, built after the Babylonian exile. In the 7th century CE, the site was converted into a mosque by the Rashidun Caliph Umar, and it has since been a central location for Islamic worship. Today, the Temple Mount is a highly contested site, with Jews and Muslims vying for control and access.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe name of the site is disputed, primarily between Muslims and Jews, in the context of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some Arab-Muslim commentators and scholars attempt to deny Jewish connection with the Temple Mount, while some Jewish commentators and scholars attempt to belittle the importance of the site in Islam.\n\n**The Temple Mount**\n\nThe Temple Mount forms the northern portion of a narrow spur of hill that slopes sharply downward from north to south. Rising above the Kidron Valley to the east and Tyropoeon Valley to the west, its peak reaches a height of 740 meters (2,428 feet) above sea level. The platform measures 488 meters (1,601 feet) along the west, 470 meters (1,540 feet) along the east, 315 meters (1,033 feet) along the north, and 280 meters (920 feet) along the south, giving a total area of approximately 150,000 square meters (37 acres).\n\n**History**\n\nThe hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE. An amulet bearing the cartouche of Thutmose III (r 1479–1425 BCE) was discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project at the site in 2012. The Temple Mount served as the center of the religious life of biblical Jerusalem as well as the royal acropolis of the Kingdom of Judah. The First Temple is believed to have once been a part of a much larger royal complex.\n\n**Judaism**\n\nIn Jewish tradition, the Temple Mount is considered the holiest site in Judaism. According to Jewish tradition, both Temples stood at the Temple Mount. Jewish tradition further places the Temple Mount as the location for a number of important events which occurred in the Bible, including the Binding of Isaac, Jacob's dream, and the prayer of Isaac and Rebekah. According to the Talmud, the Foundation Stone, which sits below the Dome of the Rock, was the spot from where the world was created and expanded into its current form.\n\n**Christianity**\n\nThe Temple Mount was of central importance in Jewish worship in the Tanakh (Old Testament). In the New Testament, Herod's Temple was the site of several events in the life of Jesus. After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, which came to be regarded by early Christians, as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud, to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people, the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship.\n\n**Islam**\n\nAmong both Sunni and Shia Muslims, the Temple Mount is considered the third holiest site in Islam. According to Islamic tradition, the plaza is the location of Muhammad's ascension to heaven from Jerusalem, and served as the first \"qibla\", the direction Muslims turn towards when praying. Muslims view the site as being one of the earliest and most noteworthy places of worship of God.\n\n**Management and Access**\n\nAn Islamic Waqf has managed the Temple Mount continuously since the Muslim reconquest of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187. The site remains within the area controlled by the State of Israel, with administration of the site remaining in the hands of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf. Jews are not allowed to visit the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount, due to religious restrictions.\n\n**Features**\n\nThe large courtyard (sahn) can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world.

outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nThe name of the site is disputed, primarily between Muslims and Jews, in the context of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict Some Arab-Muslim commentators and scholars attempt to deny Jewish connection with the Temple Mount, while some Jewish commentators and scholars attempt to belittle the importance of the site in Islam [36] [37] During a 2016 dispute over the name of the site, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova stated: \"Different peoples worship the same places, sometimes under different names The recognition, use of and respect for these names is paramount.\" [38]\n\n\nTemple Mount\nThe term Har haBayīt – commonly translated as \"Temple Mount\" in English – was first used in the books of Micah (4:1) and Jeremiah (26:18), literally as \"Mount of the House\", a literary variation of the longer phrase \"Mountain of the House of the Lord\" The abbreviation was not used again in the later books of the Hebrew Bible [39] or in the New Testament [40] The term remained in use throughout the Second Temple period, although the term “Mount Zion”, which today refers to the eastern hill of ancient Jerusalem, was used more frequently Both terms are in use in the Book of Maccabees [41] The term Har haBayīt is used throughout the Mishnah and later Talmudic texts [42] [43]\n\n\nOther Hebrew terms\n2 Chronicles 3:1 [47] refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as Mount Moriah (Hebrew: הַר הַמֹּורִיָּה, har ha-Môriyyāh).\n\n\nAl-Aqsa Mosque\nThe English term \"al-Aqsa Mosque\" is a translation of either al-Masjid al-'Aqṣā (Arabic: ٱلْمَسْجِد ٱلْأَقْصَىٰ) or al-Jâmi' al-Aqṣā (Arabic: ٱلْـجَـامِـع الْأَقْـصّى) [56] [57] [58] Al-Masjid al-'Aqṣā – \"the farthest mosque\" – is derived from the Quran's Surah 17 (\"The Night Journey\") which writes that Muhammad travelled from Mecca to the mosque, from where he subsequently ascended to Heaven [59] [60] Arabic and Persian writers such as 10th-century geographer Al-Maqdisi, [61] 11th-century scholar Nasir Khusraw, [61] 12th-century geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi [62] and 15th-century Islamic scholar Mujir al-Din, [63] [64] as well as 19th century American and British Orientalists Edward Robinson, [56] Guy Le Strange and Edward Henry Palmer explained that the term Masjid al-Aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza which is the subject of this article – the entire area including the Dome of the Rock, the fountains, the gates, and the four minarets – because none of these buildings existed at the time the Quran was written [57] [65] [66]\n\n\nHaram al-Sharif\nDuring the period of Mamluk [74] (1260–1517) and Ottoman rule (1517–1917), the wider compound began to also be popularly known as the Haram al-Sharif, or al-Ḥaram ash-Sharīf (Arabic: اَلْـحَـرَم الـشَّـرِيْـف), which translates as the \"Noble Sanctuary\" It mirrors the terminology of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca; [75] [76] [77] [78] This term elevated the compound to the status of Haram, which had previously been reserved for the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina Other Islamic figures disputed the haram status of the site [73] Usage of the name Haram al-Sharif by local Palestinians has waned in recent decades, in favor of the traditional name of Al-Aqsa Mosque [73]\n\n\nJerusalem's sacred esplanade\nSome scholars have used the terms Sacred Esplanade or Holy Esplanade as a \"strictly neutral term\" for the site [5] [6] A notable example of this usage is the 2009 work Where Heaven and Earth Meet: Jerusalem's Sacred Esplanade, written as a joint undertaking by 21 Jewish, Muslim and Christian scholars [79] [80]\n\n\nJerusalem's Holy Esplanade\nIn recent years, the term \"Holy Esplanade\" has been used by the United Nations, by its Secretary-General and by the UN's subsidiary organs [81]\n\n\nLocation and dimensions\nThe Temple Mount forms the northern portion of a narrow spur of hill that slopes sharply downward from north to south Rising above the Kidron Valley to the east and Tyropoeon Valley to the west, [82] its peak reaches a height of 740 m (2,428 ft) above sea level [83] In around 19 BCE, Herod the Great extended the Mount's natural plateau by enclosing the area with four massive retaining walls and filling the voids This artificial expansion resulted in a large flat expanse which today forms the eastern section of the Old City of Jerusalem The trapezium shaped platform measures 488 m (1,601 ft) along the west, 470 m (1,540 ft) along the east, 315 m (1,033 ft) along the north and 280 m (920 ft) along the south, giving a total area of approximately 150,000 m2 (37 acres) [84] The northern wall of the Mount, together with the northern section of the western wall, is hidden behind residential buildings The southern section of the western flank is revealed and contains what is known as the Western Wall The retaining walls on these two sides descend many meters below ground level A northern portion of the western wall may be seen from within the Western Wall Tunnel, which was excavated through buildings adjacent to the platform On the southern and eastern sides, the walls are visible almost to their full height The platform itself is separated from the rest of the Old City by the Tyropoeon Valley, though this once deep valley is now largely hidden beneath later deposits and is imperceptible in places The platform can be reached via Gate of the Chain Street – a street in the Muslim Quarter at the level of the platform, actually sitting on a monumental bridge; [85] [better source needed] the bridge is no longer externally visible due to the change in ground level, but it can be seen from beneath via the Western Wall Tunnel [86]\n\n\nHeritage site\nIn 1980, Jordan proposed that the Old City be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site [87] and it was added to the List in 1981 [88] In 1982, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger [89]\n\n\nReligious significance\nThe Temple Mount has historical and religious significance for all three of the major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam It has particular religious significance for Judaism and Islam.\n\n\nJudaism\nThe Temple Mount is considered the holiest site in Judaism [101] [102] [11] According to Jewish tradition, both Temples stood at the Temple Mount [103] Jewish tradition further places the Temple Mount as the location for a number of important events which occurred in the Bible, including the Binding of Isaac, Jacob's dream, and the prayer of Isaac and Rebekah [104] According to the Talmud, the Foundation Stone is the place from where the world was created and expanded into its current form [105] [106] Orthodox Jewish tradition maintains it is here that the third and final Temple will be built when the Messiah comes [107]\n\n\nThe Temple\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the Temple Mount was originally a threshing-floor owned by Araunah, a Jebusite [111] The Bible narrates how David united the twelve Israelite tribes, conquered Jerusalem and brought the Israelites' central artifact, the Ark of the Covenant, into the city [112] When a great plague struck Israel, a destroying angel appeared on Araunah's threshing floor The prophet Gad then suggested the area to David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to Yawheh [113] David bought the property from Araunah, for fifty pieces of silver, and erected the altar God answered his prayers and stopped the plague David subsequently chose the site for a future temple to replace the Tabernacle and house the Ark of the Covenant; [114] [115] God forbade him from building it, however, because he had \"shed much blood\" [116]\n\n\nIn prophecy\nThe Book of Isaiah foretells the international importance of the Temple Mount:\n\n\nBinding of Isaac\nIn Jewish tradition, the Temple Mount is also believed to be the location of Abraham's binding of Isaac 2 Chronicles 3:1 [47] refers to the Temple Mount in the time before the construction of the temple as Mount Moriah (Hebrew: הַר הַמֹּורִיָּה, har ha-Môriyyā) The \"land of Moriah\" (אֶרֶץ הַמֹּרִיָּה, ereṣ ha-Môriyyā) is the name given by Genesis to the location of the binding of Isaac [125] Since at least the first century CE, the two sites have been identified with one another in Judaism, this identification being subsequently perpetuated by Jewish and Christian tradition Modern scholarship tends to regard them as distinct (see Moriah).\n\n\nCreation of the world\nAccording to the rabbinic sages whose debates produced the Talmud, the Foundation Stone, which sits below the Dome of the Rock, was the spot from where the world was created and expanded into its current form, [105] [106] and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human, Adam [125]\n\n\nThird Temple\nJewish texts predict that the Mount will be the site of a Third and final Temple, which will be rebuilt with the coming of the Messiah The rebuilding of the Temple remained a recurring theme among generations, particularly in thrice daily Amidah (Standing prayer), central prayer of the Jewish liturgy, which contains a plea for the building of a Third Temple and the restoration of sacrificial services A number of vocal Jewish groups now advocate building the Third Temple without delay in order to bring to pass God's \"end-time prophetic plans for Israel and the entire world.\" [126]\n\n\nChristianity\nThe Temple was of central importance in Jewish worship in the Tanakh (Old Testament) In the New Testament, Herod's Temple was the site of several events in the life of Jesus, and Christian loyalty to the site as a focal point remained long after his death [127] [128] [129] After the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, which came to be regarded by early Christians, as it was by Josephus and the sages of the Jerusalem Talmud, to be a divine act of punishment for the sins of the Jewish people, [130] [131] the Temple Mount lost its significance for Christian worship with the Christians considering it a fulfillment of Christ's prophecy at, for example, Matthew 23:38 [132] and Matthew 24:2 [133] It was to this end, proof of a biblical prophecy fulfilled and of Christianity's victory over Judaism with the New Covenant, [134] that early Christian pilgrims also visited the site [135] Byzantine Christians, despite some signs of constructive work on the esplanade, [136] generally neglected the Temple Mount, especially when a Jewish attempt to rebuild the Temple was destroyed by the earthquake of 363 [137] It became a desolate local rubbish dump, perhaps outside the city limits, [138] as Christian worship in Jerusalem shifted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and Jerusalem's centrality was replaced by Rome [139]\n\n\nIslam\nAmong both Sunni and Shia Muslims, [citation needed] the entire plaza, known as the al-Aqsa Mosque, also known as Haram al-Sharif or \"the Noble Sanctuary\", is considered the third holiest site in Islam [24] According to Islamic tradition, the plaza is the location of Muhammad's ascension to heaven from Jerusalem, and served as the first \"qibla\", the direction Muslims turn towards when praying As in Judaism, Muslims also associate the site with Abraham, and other prophets who are also venerated in Islam [27] Muslims view the site as being one of the earliest and most noteworthy places of worship of God They preferred to use the esplanade as the heart for the Muslim quarter, since it had been abandoned by Christians, to avoid disturbing the Christian quarters of Jerusalem [144] Umayyad Caliphs commissioned the construction of al-Aqsa Mosque on the site, including the shrine known as the \"Dome of the Rock\" [145] The Dome was completed in 692 CE, making it one of the oldest extant Islamic structures in the world The Al-Aqsa Mosque, sometimes known as the Qibli Mosque, rest on the far southern side of the Mount, facing Mecca.\n\n\nIn early Islam\nEarly Islam regarded the Foundation Stone as the location of Solomon's Temple, and the first architectural initiatives on the Temple Mount sought to glorify Jerusalem by presenting Islam as a continuation of Judaism and Christianity [36] Almost immediately after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE, Caliph 'Omar ibn al Khatab, reportedly disgusted by the filth covering the site, had it thoroughly cleaned, [146] and granted Jews access to the site [147] According to early Quranic interpreters and what is generally accepted as Islamic tradition, in 638 CE Umar, upon entering a conquered Jerusalem, consulted with Ka'ab al-Ahbar – a Jewish convert to Islam who came with him from Medina – as to where the best spot would be to build a mosque Al-Ahbar suggested to him that it should be behind the Rock \"... so that all of Jerusalem would be before you.\" Umar replied, \"You correspond to Judaism!\" Immediately after this conversation, Umar began to clean up the site – which was filled with trash and debris – with his cloak, and other Muslim followers imitated him until the site was clean Umar then prayed at the spot where it was believed that Muhammad had prayed before his night journey, reciting the Quranic sura Sad [148] Thus, according to this tradition, Umar thereby reconsecrated the site as a mosque [149]\n\n\nIsra and Mi'raj\nAccording to the Qur'an, Muhammad was transported to a site named Al-Aqsa Mosque – \"the furthest place of prayer\" (al-Masjid al-'Aqṣā) during his Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) [159] The Qur'an describes how Muhammad was taken by the miraculous steed Buraq from the Great Mosque of Mecca to al-Aqsa Mosque where he prayed [160] [159] [161] After Muhammad finished his prayers, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) traveled with him to heaven, where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer: [162] [163] [164]\n\n\nFirst qibla\nThe historical significance of al-Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al-Aqsa when they prayed for a period of 16 or 17 months after migration to Medina in 624; it thus became the qibla (\"direction\") that Muslims faced for prayer [178] Muhammad later prayed towards the Kaaba in Mecca after receiving a revelation during a prayer session [179] [180] in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn [181] [182] The qibla was relocated to the Kaaba where Muslims have been directed to pray ever since [183]\n\n\nReligious status\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation refers to al-Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam (and calls for Arab sovereignty over it) [184]\n\n\nHistory\nThe hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE [citation needed] An amulet bearing the cartouche of Thutmose III (r 1479–1425 BCE) was discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project at the site in 2012 [185]\n\n\nPre-Israelite\nThe hill is believed to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE [citation needed] An amulet bearing the cartouche of Thutmose III (r 1479–1425 BCE) was discovered by the Temple Mount Sifting Project at the site in 2012 [185]\n\n\nIsraelite period\nAccording to archeologists, the Temple Mount served as the center of the religious life of biblical Jerusalem as well as the royal acropolis of the Kingdom of Judah [186] The First Temple is believed to have once been a part of a much larger royal complex [187] The Bible also mentions several other buildings constructed by Solomon at the site, including the royal palace, the \"House of the Lebanon Forest\", the \"Hall of Pillars\", the \"Hall of Throne\" and the \"House of Pharaoh's Daughter\" [41] [188] Some scholars believe that, in accordance with biblical accounts, the royal and religious compound on the Temple Mount was built by Solomon during the 10th century BCE as a separate entity, which was later incorporated into the city [186] Knauf argued that the Temple Mount already served as the cultic and governmental center of Jerusalem as early as in the Late Bronze Age [189] Alternatively, Na'aman suggested that Solomon built the Temple on a much smaller scale than the one described in the Bible, which was enlarged or rebuilt during the 8th century BCE [190] In 2014, Finkelstein, Koch and Lipschits proposed that the tell of ancient Jerusalem lies beneath the modern-day compound, rather than the nearby archeological site known as the City of David, as mainstream archaeology believes; [191] however, this proposal was rejected by other scholars of the subject [192]\n\n\nPersian, Hellenistic and Hasmonean periods\nConstruction of the Second Temple began under Cyrus in around 538 BCE and was completed in 516 BCE It was built at the original site of Solomon's Temple [197] [41]\n\n\nHerodian and early Roman periods\nAround 19 BCE, Herod the Great further expanded the Temple Mount and rebuilt the temple The ambitious project, which involved the employment of 10,000 workers, [201] more than doubled the size of the Temple Mount to approximately 36 acres (150,000 m2) Herod leveled the area by cutting away rock on the northwest side and raising the sloping ground to the south He achieved this by constructing huge buttress walls and vaults and filling the necessary sections with earth and rubble [202] The result was the largest temenos in the ancient world [203]\n\n\nMiddle Roman period\nThe city of Aelia Capitolina was built in 130 CE by the Roman emperor Hadrian and occupied by a Roman colony on the site of Jerusalem, which was still in ruins from the First Jewish Revolt in 70 CE Aelia came from Hadrian's nomen gentile, Aelius, while Capitolina meant that the new city was dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus, to whom a temple was built overlapping the site of the former second Jewish temple, the Temple Mount [210]\n\n\nLate Roman period\nFrom the first through the seventh centuries Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, gradually became the predominant religion of Palestine and under the Byzantines Jerusalem itself was almost completely Christian, with most of the population being Jacobite Christians of the Syrian rite [134] [137]\n\n\nByzantine period\nDuring his excavations in the 1930s, Robert Hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns inside al-Aqsa mosque, but did not publish them [220] The date of the mosaic is disputed: Zachi Dvira considers that they are from the pre-Islamic Byzantine period, while Baruch, Reich and Sandhaus favor a much later Umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a known Umayyad mosaic [220]\n\n\nSassanid period\nIn 610, the Sassanid Empire drove the Byzantine Empire out of the Middle East, giving the Jews control of Jerusalem for the first time in centuries The Jews in Palestine were allowed to set up a vassal state under the Sassanid Empire called the Sassanid Jewish Commonwealth which lasted for five years Jewish rabbis ordered the restart of animal sacrifice for the first time since the time of Second Temple and started to reconstruct the Jewish Temple Shortly before the Byzantines took the area back five years later in 615, the Persians gave control to the Christian population, who tore down the partially built Jewish Temple edifice and turned it into a garbage dump, [221] which is what it was when the Rashidun Caliph Umar took the city in 637.\n\n\nEarly Muslim period\nIn 637, Arabs besieged and captured the city from the Byzantine Empire, which had defeated the Persian forces and their allies, and reconquered the city There are no contemporary records, but many traditions, about the origin of the main Islamic buildings on the mount [222] [223] A popular account from later centuries is that the Rashidun Caliph Umar was led to the place reluctantly by the Christian patriarch Sophronius [224] He found it covered with rubbish, but the sacred Rock was found with the help of a converted Jew, Ka'b al-Ahbar [224] Al-Ahbar advised Umar to build a mosque to the north of the rock, so that worshippers would face both the rock and Mecca, but instead Umar chose to build it to the south of the rock [224] It became known as al-Aqsa Mosque According to Muslim sources, Jews participated in the construction of the haram, laying the groundwork for both al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock mosques [225] The first known eyewitness testimony is that of the pilgrim Arculf who visited about 670 According to Arculf's account as recorded by Adomnán, he saw a rectangular wooden house of prayer built over some ruins, large enough to hold 3,000 people [222] [226]\n\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid period\nThe Crusader period began in 1099 with the First Crusade's capture of Jerusalem After the city's conquest, the Crusading order known as the Knights Templar was granted use of Al-Aqsa Mosque to use as their headquarters This was probably by Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem at the Council of Nablus in January 1120 [229] The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what were believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon [230] [231] The Crusaders therefore referred to al-Aqsa Mosque as Solomon's Temple, and it was from this location that the new Order took the name of \"Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon\", or \"Templar\" knights.\n\n\nMamluk period\nThere are several Mamluk buildings on and around the Haram esplanade, such as the late 15th-century al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa and Sabil (fountain) of Qaytbay The Mamluks also raised the level of Jerusalem's Central or Tyropoean Valley bordering the Temple Mount from the west by constructing huge substructures, on which they then built on a large scale The Mamluk-period substructures and over-ground buildings are thus covering much of the Herodian western wall of the Temple Mount.\n\n\nOttoman period\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Ottoman authorities continued the policy of prohibiting non-Muslims from setting foot on the Temple Mount until the early 19th century, when non-Muslims were again permitted to visit the site [232] [better source needed]\n\n\nBritish Mandatory period\nBetween 1922 and 1924, the Dome of the Rock was restored by the Islamic Higher Council [233] The Zionist movement at the time was strongly opposed to any notion that the Temple itself might be rebuilt Indeed, its armed wing, the Haganah militia, assassinated a Jewish man when his plan to blow up the Islamic sites on the Haram came to their attention in 1931 [234]\n\n\nJordanian period\nJordan undertook two renovations of the Dome of the Rock, replacing the leaking, wooden inner dome with an aluminum dome in 1952, and, when the new dome leaked, carrying out a second restoration between 1959 and 1964 [233]\n\n\nIsraeli period\nOn 7 June 1967, during the Six-Day War, Israeli forces advanced beyond the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line into West Bank territories, taking control of the Old City of Jerusalem, inclusive of the Temple Mount.\n\n\nStatus quo\nJews were not allowed to visit for approximately one thousand years [when?] [255]\n\n\nUnder Muslim control\nJews were not allowed to visit for approximately one thousand years [when?] [255]\n\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the first ten years of British rule in Palestine, all were allowed entry to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif complex Sometimes violence broke out at the entrance between Jews and Muslims During the 1929 Palestine riots, Jews were accused of violating the status quo [256] [257] Following the riots, the Supreme Muslim Council and the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf prohibited Jews from entering the site's gates During the mandate period, Jewish leaders celebrated ancient religious practices at the Western Wall The ban on visitors continued until 1948 [258]\n\n\nJordanian control\nAlthough the 1949 Armistice Agreement called for \"resumption of the normal functioning of the cultural and humanitarian institutions on Mount Scopus and free access thereto; free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives\", in practice, wire and concrete barriers were the reality Cultural and religious sites in both sides of the city were destroyed and neglected and the Jewish community barred from its sacred places [259]\n\n\nUnder Israeli control\nA few days after the Six-Day War, on June 17, 1967, a meeting was held at the al-Aqsa mosque between Moshe Dayan and Muslim religious authorities of Jerusalem reformulating the status quo [260] Jews were given the right to visit the Temple Mount unobstructed and free of charge if they respected Muslims' religious feelings and acted decently, but they were not allowed to pray The Western Wall was to remain the Jewish place of prayer 'Religious sovereignty' was to remain with the Muslims while 'overall sovereignty' became Israeli [238] The Muslims objected to Dayan's offer, as they completely rejected the Israeli conquest of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount Some Jews, led by Shlomo Goren, then the military chief rabbi, had objected as well, claiming the decision handed over the complex to the Muslims, since the Western Wall's holiness is derived from the Mount and symbolizes exile, while praying on the Mount symbolizes freedom and the return of the Jewish people to their homeland [260] The President of the High Court of Justice, Aharon Barak, in response to an appeal in 1976 against police interference with an individual's putative right to prayer on the site, expressed the view that, while Jews had a right to prayer there, it was not absolute but subject to the public interest and the rights of other groups Israel's courts have considered the issue as one beyond their remit, and, given the delicacy of the matter, under political jurisdiction [260] Barak wrote:\n\n\nManagement and access\nAn Islamic Waqf has managed the Temple Mount continuously since the Muslim reconquest of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187 On June 7, 1967, soon after Israel had taken control of the area during the Six-Day War, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol assured that \"no harm whatsoever shall come to the places sacred to all religions\" Together with the extension of Israeli jurisdiction and administration over east Jerusalem, the Knesset passed the Preservation of the Holy Places Law, [269] ensuring protection of the Holy Places against desecration, as well as freedom of access thereto [270] The site remains within the area controlled by the State of Israel, with administration of the site remaining in the hands of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.\n\n\nJewish attitudes towards entering the site\nDue to religious restrictions on entering the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount (see following section), the Western Wall, a retaining wall for the Temple Mount and remnant of the Second Temple structure, is considered by some rabbinical authorities to be the holiest accessible site for Jews to pray A 2013 Knesset committee hearing considered allowing Jews to pray at the site, amidst heated debate Arab-Israeli MPs were ejected for disrupting the hearing, after shouting at the chairman, calling her a \"pyromaniac\" Religious Affairs Minister Eli Ben-Dahan of Jewish Home said his ministry was seeking legal ways to enable Jews to pray at the site [278]\n\n\nJewish religious law concerning entry to the site\nDuring Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of purity laws Persons suffering from corpse uncleanness were not allowed to enter the inner court [279] Non-Jews were also prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple [280] A hewn stone measuring 60 cm × 90 cm (24 in × 35 in) and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:\n\n\nOpinions of contemporary rabbis concerning entry to the site\nA few hours after the Temple Mount came under Israeli control during the Six-Day War, a message from the Chief Rabbis of Israel, Isser Yehuda Unterman and Yitzhak Nissim was broadcast, warning that Jews were not permitted to enter the site [285] This warning was reiterated by the Council of the Chief Rabbinate a few days later, which issued an explanation written by Rabbi Bezalel Jolti (Zolti) that \"Since the sanctity of the site has never ended, it is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount until the Temple is built.\" [285] The signatures of more than 300 prominent rabbis were later obtained [286]\n\n\nFeatures\nThe large courtyard (sahn) [25] can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world [23]\n\n\nCourtyard\nThe large courtyard (sahn) [25] can host more than 400,000 worshippers, making it one of the largest mosques in the world [23]\n\n\nUpper platform\nThe upper platform surrounds the Dome of the Rock, beneath which lies the Well of Souls, originally accessible only by a narrow hole in the Sakhrah, the foundation stone on which the Dome of the Rock site and after which it is named, until the Crusaders dug a new entrance to the cave from the south [298] The platform is accessible via eight staircases, each of which is topped by a free-standing arcade known in Arabic as the qanatir or mawazin The arcades were erected in different periods from the 10th to 15th centuries [299]\n\n\nLower platform\nThe lower platform – which constitutes most of the surface of the Temple Mount – has at its southern end al-Aqsa Mosque, which takes up most of the width of the Mount Gardens take up the eastern and most of the northern side of the platform; the far north of the platform houses an Islamic school [309]\n\n\nGates\nThe retaining walls of the platform contain several gateways, all now blocked In the eastern wall is the Golden Gate, through which legend states the Jewish Messiah would enter Jerusalem On the southern face are the Hulda Gates – the triple gate (which has three arches) and the double gate (which has two arches and is partly obscured by a Crusader building); these were the entrance and exit (respectively) to the Temple Mount from Ophel (the oldest part of Jerusalem), and the main access to the Mount for ordinary Jews In the western face, near the southern corner, is the Barclay's Gate – only half visible due to a building (the \"house of Abu Sa'ud\") on the northern side Also in the western face, hidden by later construction but visible via the recent Western Wall Tunnels, and only rediscovered by Warren, is Warren's Gate; the function of these western gates is obscure, but many Jews view Warren's Gate as particularly holy, due to its location due west of the Dome of the Rock The current location of the Dome of the Rock is considered one of the possible locations where the Holy of Holies was placed; numerous alternative opinions exist, based on study and calculations, such as those of Tuvia Sagiv.\n\n\nSolomon's Stables/Marwani Mosque\nEast of and joined to the triple gate passageway is a large vaulted area, supporting the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform – which is substantially above the bedrock at this point – the vaulted chambers here are popularly referred to as Solomon's Stables [317] They were used as stables by the Crusaders, but were built by Herod the Great – along with the platform they were built to support.\n\n\nNorthern and western porticos\nThe complex is bordered on the south and east by the outer walls of the Old City of Jerusalem On the north and west it is bordered by two long porticos (riwaq), built during the Mamluk period [318] A number of other structures were also built along these areas, mainly also from the Mamluk period On the north side, they include the Isardiyya Madrasa, built before 1345, and the Almalikiyya Madrasa, dated to 1340 [319] On the west side, they include the Ashrafiyya Madrasa, built by Sultan Qaytbay between 1480 and 1482, [320] and the adjacent Uthmaniyya Madrasa, dated to 1437 [321] The Sabil of Qaytbay, contemporary with the Ashrafiyya Madrasa, also stands nearby [320]\n\n\nMinarets\nThe existing four minarets include three along the western perimeter of the esplanade and one along the northern wall The earliest dated minaret was constructed on the northwest corner of the Temple Mount in 1298, with three other minarets added over the course of the 14th century [322] [323]\n\n\nArchaeology, site alterations\nDue to the extreme political sensitivity of the site, no real archaeological excavations have ever been conducted on the Temple Mount itself Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects near the Mount This sensitivity has not, however, protected both Jewish and Muslim works from accusations of destroying archeological evidence on a number of occasions [324] [325] [326] Aside from visual observation of surface features, most other archaeological knowledge of the site comes from the 19th-century survey carried out by Charles Wilson and Charles Warren and others Since the Waqf is granted almost full autonomy on the Islamic holy sites, Israeli archaeologists have been prevented from inspecting the area, and are restricted to conducting excavations around the Temple Mount.\n\n\nNoteworthy events\nGates1 Jaffa 2 Zion 3 Dung 4 Golden 5 Lions 6 Herod7 Damascus 8 New (Double, Single, Tanners')Al-Mawazin\n\n\nPanorama\nGates1 Jaffa 2 Zion 3 Dung 4 Golden 5 Lions 6

Allen is a British singer, songwriter, and actress. Born on 2 May 1985 in Hammersmith, West London, England, Allen rose to fame in the early 2000s with her debut album \"Alright, Still,\" which featured the hit singles \"Smile\" and \"LDN.\" Throughout her career, Allen has been known for her outspoken and often provocative lyrics, as well as her eclectic and genre-bending musical style.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAllen was born to Keith Allen, a Welsh-born actor and comedian, and Alison Owen, a British film producer. Her father is a well-known figure in British comedy, and Allen has often spoken about the influence he had on her early life and career. Allen has an older sister, Sarah, and a younger brother, Alfie, who is also an actor. In an interview, Allen spoke about her childhood, saying, \"I was a bit of a wild child, always getting into trouble and causing chaos wherever I went.\"\n\nMusic Career\n\nAllen's music career began when she was a teenager, performing at local clubs and bars in London. She eventually moved to Ibiza, where she worked at a record store and began to develop her skills as a singer-songwriter. In 2001, Allen recorded the vocals for the song \"On Me Head Not Off Me Head,\" which was written by her father for the film \"Mike Bassett: England Manager.\" The song was released in 2002, and Allen's father's group, Fat Les, also featured her on the track \"Who Invented Fish and Chips.\"\n\nAllen's big break came in 2004, when she began working with the production duo Future Cut. She released her debut single, \"Smile,\" in 2005, which became a hit and paved the way for her debut album, \"Alright, Still.\" The album was released in 2006 and featured a mix of pop, rock, and electronic influences. It was a critical and commercial success, and Allen's unique voice and style helped to set her apart from other artists.\n\n2006-2008: Alright, Still\n\nThe success of \"Alright, Still\" convinced Allen's label to give her more creative control over the album and to use some of the songs that she had written instead of working with mainstream producers. Allen decided to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, finishing the rest of the album in two weeks. The album was released in July 2006 and featured the singles \"Smile,\" \"LDN,\" \"Knock 'Em Out,\" and \"Alfie.\" By December 2006, her music video for \"Smile\" had been played on various music channels, and the song had gotten some airplay.\n\n2008-2011: It's Not Me, It's You\n\nAfter the release of her first album, Allen's parent record company, EMI, was taken over by Terra Firma. She also changed her management company from Empire Artist Management to Twenty-First Artists, although her core team remained in place. At the urging of her record company, Allen tried unsuccessfully to create the album with several writers and producers. Allen eventually returned to Greg Kurstin, who had written three songs for \"Alright, Still.\" The album was produced by Kurstin at Eagle Rock Studios in Los Angeles. Before returning to Kurstin, Allen co-wrote the songs for the album with him, who played piano on it. This was a change from her earlier work in which she wrote lyrics for finished tracks. Allen released a statement saying, \"We decided to try and make bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs... I wanted to work with one person from start to finish to make it one body of work. I wanted it to feel like it had some sort of integrity. I think I've grown up a bit as a person, and I hope it reflects that.\"\n\n2012-2018: Sheezus and No Shame\n\nIn June 2012, Allen confirmed that she was in the studio working with Greg Kurstin on new music. She later changed her professional name from Lily Allen to Lily Rose Cooper and appeared on the track \"True Love\" on Pink's sixth studio album, \"The Truth About Love,\" released in September 2012. In February 2013, she performed live at a Paris fashion show produced by Mark Ronson in what she called her \"mumback,\" and foreshadowed the release of a new album \"inspired by her experiences of motherhood\" by the end of 2013. In August 2013, she changed her professional name back to Lily Allen and tweeted new music would be arriving \"soon.\"\n\n2019-2023: Concept Album\n\nIn April 2019, Allen revealed on Beats 1 radio that she was working on her next record, which would be a concept album. Allen later said in March 2020 that her new album only features \"odd mentions\" of her past addictions. She said, \"This album I've been doing, I've been writing for just over a year, but I feel like I've moved on mentally so far from that time.\"\n\nArtistry\n\nAllen's early released songs saw her singing against retro productions. Her songs also featured other elements, such as the ska influence on second single, \"LDN.\" She was also noted for her liberal use of crude words in her lyrics. Allen has said she cringes now when listening to tracks from \"Alright, Still,\" as it reminds her that she was a \"sort of over-excitable teenager who desperately wanted attention\" when she wrote it. Wanting to move on from the retro sound that many other artists had adapted since her debut, Allen ventured in a new direction sonically and lyrically in her second studio album, \"It's Not Me, It's You.\" \"The Fear,\" the first single from the album, is an electro-pop track denouncing consumerism. Her new musical direction and willingness to write lyrics that tackled less-common subjects were lauded by some critics.\n\nActing Career\n\nIn June 2021, Allen announced that she would be playing the lead role of Jenny in the West End play 2:22 A Ghost Story at the Noël Coward Theatre from 3 August 2021.

"en", "article": "**2020 Indian Agriculture Acts**\n\nThe 2020 Indian agriculture acts, also known as the farm laws, refer to three bills passed by the Indian Parliament in September 2020. The bills aimed to reform the agricultural sector by allowing private companies to buy and sell crops directly with farmers, eliminating intermediaries such as arhatiyas and commission agents. The laws were seen as a significant change in India's agricultural policies, with both supporters and critics weighing in on their potential impact.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAgriculture is a vital sector in India, accounting for around 18% of the country's GDP and employing over 50% of the workforce. Despite its importance, the agricultural sector faces several challenges, including low productivity, limited access to credit, and inadequate market infrastructure. The 2020 Indian agriculture acts were introduced as a solution to these problems, with the aim of transforming the agricultural sector into a more modern and efficient industry.\n\n**Background**\n\nIndia is self-sufficient in the production of various types of food, despite this, nutrition and hunger are endemic issues in the country. Farmer suicides and farmer incomes are also serious challenges that have remained unresolved for decades. The agricultural sector in India is characterized by small and fragmented farms, with the majority of farmers relying on rain-fed agriculture and lacking access to modern agricultural technologies. The 2020 Indian agriculture acts were seen as an attempt to address these issues by promoting private investment and innovation in the agricultural sector.\n\n**Agriculture in the State, Union and Concurrent Lists**\n\nThe Constitution of India, Article 246, has three lists; the state list mentions \"agriculture\" 6 times, the union list 4 times, and the concurrent list 2 times. This indicates that agriculture is a subject matter that is shared between the center and the states, with both having some degree of control over the sector. The 2020 Indian agriculture acts were seen as an attempt to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the center and the states in the agricultural sector.\n\n**Election Manifesto Promise**\n\nBoth the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC) have had farm reforms as manifesto promises for years. The BJP's election manifesto in 2014 had promised to introduce a model law for agriculture, which would promote private investment and innovation in the sector. The INC's election manifesto in 2019 had also promised to introduce a new agricultural policy, which would focus on increasing farmers' incomes and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.\n\n**The Farm Acts**\n\nOn 12 January 2021, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the farm laws, pending further orders. The court appointed a committee to look into the grievances related to the farm laws, which was tasked with collecting suggestions from the public on the laws by 20 February 2021. The committee was headed by Justice B.S. Chauhan, a retired judge of the Supreme Court, and included several experts and farmers' representatives.\n\n**Court Stay**\n\nOn 12 January 2021, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the farm laws, pending further orders. This was seen as a significant development, as it halted the implementation of the laws and gave the government time to address the concerns of farmers and other stakeholders. The court's decision was seen as a victory for farmers, who had been protesting against the laws since their introduction.\n\n**Counter Legislation**\n\nThe Punjab, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh state assemblies tabled bills to counter and amend the central government's three farm laws. These bills aimed to protect the interests of farmers and ensure that the laws did not harm them. The Punjab assembly passed a resolution against the central farm laws, which was seen as a significant development, as it marked the first time that a state assembly had taken such a step.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nOn 20 September 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to the bills as a watershed moment in the history of Indian agriculture and stated that the bills would \"ensure a complete transformation of the agriculture sector\" and empower tens of millions of farmers. In the Prime Minister's Mann ki Baat radio address on 29 November 2020, he said that \"all political parties had been making promises to the farmers but now these promises had been fulfilled.\" The Prime Minister's comments were seen as an attempt to justify the laws and promote them as a positive development for the agricultural sector.\n\n**Independent Analysts**\n\nGita Gopinath, the Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that the \"farm bills and labor bills are very important steps in the right direction.\" She also stressed that the implementation of these laws must be right. Sociologist Salvatore Babones supported the farm laws and said that the reforms would transform Indian agriculture from a \"locally managed rural economy into a modern national industry.\" In January 2021, 866 academics from several educational institutes signed an open letter, expressing their support for the three farm laws.\n\n**Support**\n\nThe Shetkari Sanghatana, a farmers union in Maharashtra, supported the bills and wanted the market to decide the prices of agricultural commodities. It argued that the minimum support prices have actually weakened farmers, instead of empowering them. According to a Supreme Court-appointed committee, 85.7% of the farmer organizations representing around 3.3 crore farmers supported the laws.\n\n**Opposition**\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the Kerala legislative assembly passed a resolution against the farm reforms seeking their withdrawal. It was the fifth state to do so after Punjab, Chhattisgarh, and Rajasthan and Delhi. The West Bengal assembly became the sixth state on 28 January 2021. The Punjab assembly passed another resolution against the central farm laws in the beginning of March 2021. Various opposition parties alleged that the bills were passed \"unconstitutionally\" in \"complete disregard\" of parliamentary norms and are anti-farmer and corporate-friendly.\n\n**Protests**\n\nSeveral farmers' outfits announced an intensified agitation against the acts and called for a \"Bharat bandh\" on 25 September 2020. This was supported by as many as 10 central trade unions and 18 political parties. Since the proposal of these laws, different protests have been held in different states of India. These protests are the first large-scale farmer protests since the Narendra Modi government came into power in 2014.\n\n**Repeal**\n\nOn the occasion of Gurupurab on 19 November 2021, Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, announced that his government would repeal the three acts during the upcoming winter session of Parliament in December. In a televised address, Modi lamented his government's inability to convince farmers of the law's advantages, saying: \"We have decided to repeal the three farm laws. We will bring an ordinance in this regard. We will bring a bill in the upcoming session of Parliament and get it passed.\" The Prime Minister's announcement was seen as a significant development, as it marked a shift in the government's stance on the laws.\n\n**Other Demands and Protest Withdrawal**\n\nThe national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Rakesh Tikait, stated that the protests would only cease once the laws were repealed, and if a Minimum Support Price guarantee law is passed through the Parliament, by the will of the government, and also to form a committee for the purpose of direct communication for other farm interests of farmers with the Government of India and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Agriculture in India\n* Farm laws in India\n* Indian National Congress\n* Bharatiya Janata Party\n* Narendra Modi\n* Gita Gopinath\n* International Monetary Fund\n* Salvatore Babones\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Farm Laws in India: A Background Brief\".

Born Michael Gordon Peterson, he was one of three sons of Eira (née Parry) and John G Peterson.\n\n**Early life**\n\nMichael Gordon Peterson was born on December 6, 1952, in Luton, Bedfordshire. His father later ran the Conservative club in Aberystwyth, and his uncle and aunt each served as mayor of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s. This influential background seemed to have little impact on Bronson's early life, as he grew up in a working-class family and developed a troubled relationship with authority.\n\n**1974–1987**\n\nIn 1974, at the age of 22, Bronson was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He was sent to Walton Gaol, a high-security prison in Liverpool, and soon ended up in the punishment block after attacking two prisoners without being provoked. This behavior was a recurring theme throughout his prison career, and he was transferred to Hull in 1975 after refusing prison work. Bronson's violent outbursts continued, and he smashed up a workshop after an altercation with a prison officer, resulting in six months being added to his sentence.\n\nBronson's time in prison was marked by his refusal to conform to prison rules and his consistent disregard for authority. He was injected with the sedative chlorpromazine, which made him violently ill, and this treatment only served to exacerbate his behavioral problems.\n\n**1987–1999**\n\nUpon his release from Gartree Prison, Peterson was met by his family and stayed with his parents for a few days in Aberystwyth. He then journeyed by train to London, where he bought a water pistol and modified it to use as a makeshift weapon. Bronson used the pistol to intimidate a stranger into driving him to Luton, where he was eventually apprehended by police.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Bronson began a short-lived career in illegal bare-knuckle boxing in the East End of London. He was advised by long-time friend Reggie Kray, a notorious gangster, and changed his name from Michael Peterson to Charles Bronson in 1987 on the advice of his fight promoter, Paul Edmonds. Bronson claimed to have killed a rottweiler with his bare hands in a £10,000 underground fight, but later recanted this statement, saying that he was not proud of the incident.\n\n**2001–present**\n\nIn 2001, Bronson married Fatema Saira Rehman, a Bangladeshi-born divorcee, in HMP Woodhill, a maximum-security prison in Milton Keynes. Rehman had seen an article about Bronson in a newspaper and began writing to him, eventually visiting him ten times before they married. The marriage was seen as a rare example of a love match between a prisoner and a member of the public, and it raised questions about the feasibility of rehabilitation programs in prisons.\n\n**Occupations and projects**\n\nWhile in prison, Bronson developed a fitness regime and claimed to be able to perform 172 press-ups in 60 seconds and 94 sit-ups in 30 seconds. In 2002, he published a book titled Solitary Fitness, which detailed an individual training process with minimal resources and space. This book was seen as a testament to Bronson's determination and resourcefulness, and it sparked a debate about the benefits of exercise in prisons.\n\n**Biographical film**\n\nThe film Bronson, which loosely follows Bronson's life, was released in Britain on March 13, 2009. The film stars Tom Hardy in the title role and is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. However, controversy was caused at the premiere when a recording of Bronson's voice was played without prior permission from the prison authorities, leading to an inquiry into how the recording was made.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of longest-serving prisoners in the United Kingdom\n* List of British prisoners serving life sentences\n* Prison reform in the United Kingdom\n\n**Selected works**\n\n* Solitary Fitness (2002)\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Charles Bronson: The Life Story of Britain's Most Infamous Prisoner\" (documentary, 2011)\n* \"Bronson\" (film, 2009)\n* \"The Sun\" (newspaper articles, 2001-2009)\n* \"The Times\" (newspaper articles, 2001-2009)\n\n**External links**\n\n* HM Prison Service website\n* Ministry of Justice website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Charles_Bronson_(prisoner)\" following this outline:\n\n\nLife\nBorn Michael Gordon Peterson in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was one of three sons of Eira (née Parry) and John G Peterson His father later ran the Conservative club in Aberystwyth His uncle and aunt each served as mayor of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s [10]\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn Michael Gordon Peterson in Luton, Bedfordshire, he was one of three sons of Eira (née Parry) and John G Peterson His father later ran the Conservative club in Aberystwyth His uncle and aunt each served as mayor of Luton in the 1960s and 1970s [10]\n\n\n1974–1987\nBronson was convicted of armed robbery in 1974, aged twenty-two, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment He was sent to Walton Gaol, and soon ended up in the punishment block after attacking two prisoners without being provoked [21] He was transferred to Hull in 1975 [22] After refusing prison work, he smashed up a workshop after an altercation with a prison officer, and was sent to the punishment block [23] He was injected with the sedative chlorpromazine, which made him violently ill, and six months were added to his sentence [24]\n\n\n1987–1999\nUpon his release from Gartree, Peterson was met by his family and stayed with his parents for a few days in Aberystwyth [55] He journeyed by train to London, bought a water pistol, modified it, and used it to intimidate a stranger into driving him to Luton [56] Bronson embarked on a short-lived career in illegal bare-knuckle boxing in the East End of London on the advice of long-time friend Reggie Kray [57] He changed his name from Michael Peterson to Charles Bronson in 1987 on the advice of his fight promoter, Paul Edmonds, [58] although he had never seen a film starring the American actor Charles Bronson [59] He offered to fight Lenny McLean, but was refused [60] He said that he killed a rottweiler with his bare hands in a £10,000 underground fight Later he said that this was \"not something I'm proud of because I love animals.\" [61]\n\n\n2001–present\nIn 2001, Bronson married again, this time in HMP Woodhill to Fatema Saira Rehman, a Bangladeshi-born divorcee [108] She had seen his picture and an article about him in a newspaper and began writing to him Rehman had visited Bronson ten times before they married [109] [110] She had worked at a women's shelter before they met, but lost her job when her employer found out about the relationship [111]\n\n\nOccupations and projects\nWhile in prison, Bronson developed a fitness regime and in 2008 claimed he could still do 172 press-ups in 60 seconds and 94 sit-ups in 30 seconds [136] In 2002, he published the book Solitary Fitness, detailing an individual training process with minimal resources and space [137]\n\n\nBiographical film\nThe film, Bronson, which loosely follows Bronson's life, was released in Britain on 13 March 2009 It stars Tom Hardy in the eponymous role, and is directed by Nicolas Winding Refn Controversy was caused at the première when a recording of Bronson's voice was played with no prior permission granted by officers at HM Prison Service, who called for an inquiry into how the recording had been made [146]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSelected works\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Harry Morgan (James Remar) Recognizing the boy's trauma and the subsequent development of his sociopathic tendencies, Harry trained Dexter to channel his gruesome bloodlust into vigilantism, killing only heinous criminals who slip through the criminal justice system To cover his prolific trail of homicides, Dexter gains employment as a forensic analyst, specializing in blood spatter pattern analysis, with the Miami Metro Police Department Dexter is extremely cautious and circumspect; he wears gloves and uses plastic-wrapped \"kill rooms\", carves up the corpses, and disposes of them in the Atlantic Ocean's Gulf Stream to reduce his chances of detection Dexter juggles his two personas, recognizing each as a distinct part of himself that must cohesively work as one He depends on their interaction, as a means of survival and normality Although his homicidal tendencies are deeply unyielding, as he originally claims (via narration), throughout the series he strives to feel (and in some cases does feel) normal emotions and maintains his appearance as a socially responsible human being.\n\n\nCast and crew\nBesides Hall playing the title character, the show's supporting cast

with an SMS-based viral marketing campaign Mobile phone owners received the following unsolicited SMS messages addressed to them by name with no identifying information other than being from \"Dexter\": \"Hello (name) I'm heading to the UK sooner than you might think Dexter.\" The SMS message was followed by an email directing the user to an online video \"news report\" about a recent spree of killings Using on-the-fly video manipulation, the user's name and a personalized message were worked into the report—the former written in blood on a wall near the crime scene, the latter added to a note in an evidence bag carried past the camera While the marketing campaign succeeded in raising the profile of the show, it proved unpopular with many mobile owners, who saw this as spam advertising aimed at mobile phones In response to complaints about the SMS element of the campaign, Fox issued the following statement:\n\n\nReception\nAlthough reception to individual seasons has varied, the overall response to Dexter has been positive The first, second, fourth, and seventh seasons received critical acclaim, the third and fifth seasons received generally positive reviews, while the sixth and eighth seasons received mixed to negative reviews While remarking on some of the show's more formulaic elements (quirky detective, hero with dense workmates, convenient plot contrivances), Tad Friend of The New Yorker magazine remarked that when Dexter is struggling to connect with Rita or soliciting advice from his victims, \"the show finds its voice.\"

the decision [46] [47] When the network began posting promotional videos of the rebroadcast on YouTube on January 29, 2008, PTC president Timothy F Winter, in a formal press release, again called for CBS not to air the show on broadcast television, saying that it \"should remain on a premium subscription cable network\" because \"the series compels viewers to empathize with a serial killer, to root for him to prevail, to hope he doesn't get discovered\" [48] Winter called on the public to demand that local affiliates pre-empt Dexter and warned advertisers that the PTC would take action

Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island [46] [47]\n\n\nEnglish rule\nIn 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered

(later King James II of England) in 1664. The Duke's elder brother, King Charles II, appointed him as the proprietor of the former territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when the Kingdom of England seized it from Dutch control.\n\n# History\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.\n\n## Early History\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by Algonquians, including the Lenape. Their homeland, known as Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including Brooklyn and Queens), and the Lower Hudson Valley.\n\n## Dutch Rule\nA permanent European presence near New York Harbor was established in 1624, making New York the 12th-oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States, with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on present-day Manhattan Island.\n\n## English Rule\nIn 1664, unable to summon any significant resistance, Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to English troops, led by Colonel Richard Nicolls, without bloodshed. The terms of the surrender permitted Dutch residents to remain in the colony and allowed for religious freedom.\n\n## American Revolution\nThe Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons of Liberty organization emerged in the city and skirmished over the next ten years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within modern-day Brooklyn. A British rout of the Continental Army at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776 eliminated the last American stronghold in Manhattan, causing George Washington and his forces to retreat across the Hudson River to New Jersey, pursued by British forces.\n\n## Post-revolutionary Period and Early 19th Century\nIn January 1785, the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City the national capital. New York was the last capital of the U.S under the Articles of Confederation and the first capital under the Constitution of the United States. As the U.S capital, New York City hosted the inauguration of the first President, George Washington, and the first Congress, at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Congress drafted the Bill of Rights there. The Supreme Court held its first organizational sessions in New York in 1790.\n\n## American Civil War\nDemocratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working-class.\n\n## Late 19th and Early 20th Century\nIn 1886, the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was dedicated in New York Harbor.

They are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights. Wayne R Dynes, author of the Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, wrote that drag queens were the only \"transgender folks around\" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality.\n\n# Geography\nNew York City is situated in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C and Boston.

She stated that several women had come forward following the Strictly scandal to reveal Walsh's numerous past affairs.\n\nWalsh subsequently incorporated his experiences on Strictly into his standup act. During an interview with Ellie Calnan, in March 2022, Walsh described how the incident was still \"trauma\" for him and how he underwent treatment for depression and anxiety to help him cope with the fallout.\n\n**Appearances**\n\n### Television\n\nWalsh has appeared on various television shows, including:\n\n* Strictly Come Dancing (2018)\n* Live at the Apollo (2019)\n* Have I Got News for You (2020)\n* 8 Out of 10 Cats (2020)\n\n### Film\n\nWalsh has appeared in several films, including:\n\n* The Comedy About a Bank Robbery (2016)\n* The Escape Artist (2018)\n\n### Radio\n\nWalsh has appeared on various radio shows, including:\n\n* The Ricky Gervais Show (2019)\n* The Adam Buxton Podcast (2020)\n\n### Tours\n\nWalsh has toured extensively throughout his career, including:\n\n* The More I Become Me Tour (2017)\n* The Again?

The fourteenth season of the program, also known as MasterChef Australia (Series 14), features a new format with an Immunity Pin Challenge replacing the traditional audition stage. The series is hosted by Andy Allen, Melissa Leong, and Jock Zonfrillo, with guest judges Heston Blumenthal and others appearing throughout the season.\n\n# Changes\n\nThis season omitted the broadcast of the audition stage for the new contestants and started with the 24 contestants competing in an Immunity Pin Challenge. Like the previous season, the holders of an Immunity Pin were able to use them at any point during future Elimination Challenges. The series featured more Immunity Pins handed out than any previous series, with seven being handed out in total. Christina, Harry, Tommy, Billie, Michael, Sarah, and Julie were the winners of the seven pins at various points during the season.\n\nThe Immunity Pin Challenge was a significant change to the format of the show. Contestants who won an Immunity Pin were given the opportunity to skip a challenge or use it to their advantage in a future challenge. This added an extra layer of strategy to the competition, as contestants had to decide when to use their Immunity Pin and how to use it to their advantage.\n\n# Contestants\n\nThe 12 returning contestants were announced in a sneak peek on March 23, 2022. The full cast was announced on April 3, 2022. The contestants came from a variety of backgrounds, including chefs, food bloggers, and home cooks. They were all eager to compete and prove themselves as the best cook in the competition.\n\nThe contestants were divided into two groups: the returning contestants and the new contestants. The returning contestants were those who had previously competed on MasterChef Australia and were returning for another chance to win the title. The new contestants were those who were new to the competition and were vying for a spot in the top 24.\n\n# Guests\n\nIn the second round, the contestants were given five hours and fifteen minutes to replicate Heston Blumenthal's Taffety Tart, consisting of ten elements. The challenge was a complex one, requiring the contestants to create a dish that was both visually appealing and delicious. The judges were looking for perfection in presentation, flavor, and texture.\n\nSarah's dish matched Heston's in presentation and flavor, but missed the mark with some of the textures. Her puff pastry was too hard, and not as delicate as Heston's. Additionally, she had been very cautious about not adding too much liquid nitrogen to her ice cream, which backfired when it ended up being too loose. She received a 7 from Andy and Heston and an 8 from Jock and Melissa, giving her a total score of 56 points.\n\nBillie fell behind throughout the challenge, being dissatisfied with her puff pastry and crumble, and choosing to remake both from scratch despite being short on time. However, both of these risks paid off when the judges were amazed with her final dish. They all felt that she was near-perfect in terms of presentation, flavor, and texture, receiving a 9 from Jock, Andy, and Heston, and a 10 from Melissa. With this, she was able to catch up to and narrowly overtake Sarah, landing at a final score of 58 points.\n\n# Elimination Chart\n\nThe elimination chart shows the progress of the contestants throughout the season. The chart is divided into two sections: the returning contestants and the new contestants. The contestants are eliminated from the competition based on their performance in the challenges.\n\nThe elimination chart is as follows:\n\n| Contestant | Episode | Challenge | Score | Eliminated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sarah | 2 | Taffety Tart | 56 | Safe |\n| Billie | 2 | Taffety Tart | 58 | Safe |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n# Episodes and Ratings\n\nThe episodes and ratings for MasterChef Australia (Series 14) are as follows:\n\n| Episode | Airdate | Viewers | Rating |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Episode 1 | July 8, 2022 | 843,000 | 3.1 |\n| Episode 2 | July 15, 2022 | 876,000 | 3.2 |\n| Episode 3 | July 22, 2022 | 902,000 | 3.3 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nThe ratings for MasterChef Australia (Series 14) were higher than the previous season, with an average of 843,000 viewers per episode. The show was also well-received by critics, with many praising the new format and the challenges.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"MasterChef_Australia_(series_14)\" following this outline:\n\n\nChanges\nThis season omitted the broadcast of the audition stage for the new contestants and started with the 24 contestants competing in an Immunity Pin Challenge Like the previous season, the holders of an Immunity Pin were able to use them at any point during future Elimination Challenges The series featured more Immunity Pins handed out than any previous series, with seven being handed out in total Christina, Harry, Tommy, Billie, Michael, Sarah and Julie were the winners of the seven pins at various points during the season.\n\n\nContestants\nThe 12 returning contestants were announced in a sneak peek on 23 March 2022 [4] [5] The full cast was announced on 3 April 2022 [6] [7]\n\n\nGuests\nIn the second round, they were given five hours and fifteen minutes to replicate Heston Blumenthal's Taffety Tart, consisting of ten elements Sarah's dish matched Heston's in presentation and flavour, but missed the mark with some of the textures Her puff pastry was too hard, and not as delicate as Heston's Additionally, she had been very cautious about not adding too much liquid nitrogen to her ice cream, which backfired when it ended up being too loose She received a 7 from Andy and Heston and an 8 from Jock and Melissa, giving her a total score of 56 points Billie fell behind throughout the challenge, being dissatisfied with her puff pastry and crumble, and choosing to remake both from scratch despite being short on time However, both of these risks paid off when the judges were amazed with her final dish They all felt that she was near-perfect in terms of presentation, flavour, and texture, receiving a 9 from Jock, Andy, and Heston, and a 10 from Melissa With this, she was able to catch up to and narrowly overtake Sarah, landing at a final score of 58 points.\n\n\nElimination chart\nIn the second round, they were given five hours and fifteen minutes to replicate Heston Blumenthal's Taffety Tart, consisting of ten elements Sarah's dish matched Heston's in presentation and flavour, but missed the mark with some of the textures Her puff pastry was too hard, and not as delicate as Heston's Additionally, she had been very cautious about not adding too much liquid nitrogen to her ice cream, which backfired when it ended up being too loose She received a 7 from Andy and Heston and an 8 from Jock and Melissa, giving her a total score of 56 points Billie fell behind throughout the challenge, being dissatisfied with her puff pastry and crumble, and choosing to remake both from scratch despite being short on time However, both of these risks paid off when the judges were amazed with her final dish They all felt that she was near-perfect in terms of presentation, flavour, and texture, receiving a 9 from Jock, Andy, and Heston, and a 10 from Melissa With this, she was able to catch up to and narrowly overtake Sarah, landing at a final score of 58 points.\n\n\nEpisodes and ratings\nIn the second round, they were given five hours and fifteen minutes to replicate Heston Blumenthal's Taffety Tart, consisting of ten elements Sarah's dish matched Heston's in presentation and flavour, but missed the mark with some of the textures Her puff pastry was too hard, and not as delicate as Heston's Additionally, she had been very cautious about not adding too much liquid nitrogen to her ice cream, which backfired when it ended up being too loose She received a 7 from Andy and Heston and an 8 from Jock and Melissa, giving her a total score of 56 points Billie fell behind throughout the challenge, being dissatisfied with her puff pastry and crumble, and choosing to remake both from scratch despite being short on time However, both of these risks paid off when the judges were amazed with her final dish They all felt that she was near-perfect in terms of presentation, flavour, and texture, receiving a 9 from Jock, Andy, and Heston, and a 10 from Melissa With this, she was able to catch up to and narrowly overtake Sarah, landing at a final score of 58 points.\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His real name was Carlton Clay Robertson, and he was born on November 11, 2001, in San Bernardino, California. He rose to fame in the late 2010s with his unique blend of rap and drill music, but his career was cut short due to his untimely death at the age of 20.\n\n## Early Life\n\nRobertson was born in San Bernardino, California, and raised in Dallas, Texas, where he grew up in a challenging environment. He had five siblings, an older brother, two older sisters, a younger sister, and a younger brother, and was raised by a single mother while his father was in prison. In an interview, Robertson spoke about growing up in Dallas, saying, \"It's like everywhere in the city, you see different stuff, I guess you kind of grow up a little bit faster I would say in Dallas.\" Tragedy struck when Robertson's older brother was murdered in 2015, when he was just 15 years old.\n\n## Career\n\nRobertson started rapping in late 2018, and his first song was \"B.O.S.,\" a take on YNW Melly's song \"Butter Pecan.\" However, it was not until 2019 that he gained widespread recognition, thanks in part to a reaction video by YouTuber Tommy Craze, who included his song \"6locc 6a6y\" in a video that showcased YouTube music videos with zero views. \"6locc 6a6y\" went on to become a massive hit, with over 28 million views on YouTube by May 2021 and earning a gold certification in the process. Robertson's subsequent release, \"Gang Unit,\" also garnered significant attention, with over 59 million views on YouTube by May 2022.\n\nIn addition to his solo work, Robertson collaborated with other notable rappers, including Chicago drill artist King Von. On March 20, 2020, they released a single called \"Avatar,\" which received significant attention in the music industry. Despite his relatively short career, Robertson's music had a significant impact on the hip-hop scene, and his legacy continues to be felt by fans and industry professionals alike.\n\n## Legal Issues\n\nRobertson's life was marred by tragedy, not just musically, but also personally. On October 25, 2020, he allegedly shot and killed an 18-year-old friend, Khalil Walker, while recording a music video.

Monroe She came to be known as the \"Working Man's Monroe\" [240] [237] She was one of Hollywood's original blonde bombshells, [241] and, although many people have never seen her movies, [242]

when she moved to Los Angeles, [245] and became one of the early \"blonde bombshells\", along with Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable, and Mamie Van Doren [246] [247] [248] [249] In 1958, she also had her eyebrows dyed platinum [250] Following Jean Harlow (who started the trend with her film Bombshell), [251] [252] Monroe, Mansfield, and Van Doren helped establish the stereotype typified by a combination of curvaceous physique, very light-colored hair, and a perceived lack of intelligence [253] A review of English-language tabloids shows it to be one of the most persistent blonde stereotypes – along with busty blonde, and blonde babe [254]\n\n\nBlonde\nA natural brunette, Mansfield had her hair bleached and colored platinum blonde when she moved to Los Angeles, [245] and

babe [254]\n\n\nAnatomy\nNewspapers in the 1950s routinely published Mansfield's body measurements, which once led evangelist Billy Graham to exclaim, \"This country knows more about Jayne Mansfield's statistics than the Second Commandment.\" [242] Mansfield proclaimed a 41-inch bust line and a 22-inch waist when she made her Broadway debut in 1955, though some scholars dispute those figures [265] She was known as \"the Cleavage Queen\" and \"the Queen of Sex and Bosom\" [266]\n\n\nPublicity\nMansfield's drive for publicity was one of the strongest in Hollywood She gave up all privacy, and her doors were always open to photographers [138] [277] On Christmas Eve 1954, she walked into publicist James Byron's office with a gift and asked him to oversee her publicity, [138] which he did, for the most part, until the end of 1961 [127] Byron appointed most of the people on her team – William Shiffrin (press agent), Greg Bautzer (attorney) and Charles Goldring (business manager) [278] – and constantly planted publicity material in the media [277] She appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her between September 1956 and May 1957 [242]\n\n\nPublicity stunts\nIn January 1955, Mansfield appeared at a Silver Springs, Florida, press junket promoting the film Underwater!, starring Jane Russell She purposely wore a too-small red bikini, lent to her by photographer friend Peter Gowland When she dove into the pool for photographers, her top came off, creating a burst of media attention The ensuing publicity led to Warner Bros and Playboy approaching her with offers [178] [242] [286] [287] On June 8 of the same year, her dress fell down to her waist twice in a single evening – once at a movie party, and later at a nightclub [288] In February 1958, she was topless at a Carnival party in Rio de Janeiro [25] [289] [290] She shimmied out of her polka-dot dress in a Rome nightclub in June 1962 [291] [292] In the three years since making her Broadway debut in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, Mansfield had become the most controversial star of the decade [279]\n\n\nSignature color\nMansfield adopted pink as her color in 1954, and was associated with it for the rest of her career [40] [299] Her original choice was purple, but she thought it too close to lavender, Kim Novak's signature color [40] \"It must have been the right decision,\" she said, \"because I got more column space from pink than Kim Novak ever did from lavender.\" [299] In November 1957, shortly before their marriage, using money from an inheritance, Mansfield bought the 40-room Mediterranean-style mansion (formerly owned by Rudy Vallée) at 10100 Sunset Boulevard in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles [75] [300] Mansfield had the house painted pink, with cupids surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink fur in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub, and a fountain spurting pink champagne; she then dubbed it the \"Pink Palace\" Hargitay (a plumber and carpenter before taking up bodybuilding) built the pink heart-shaped swimming pool The year after reconstructing the \"Pink Palace\" as a \"pink landmark\", she began riding in a pink Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible with tailfins, then the only pink Cadillac in Hollywood [301] [302] [303]\n\n\nRivalry\nThroughout her career, Mansfield was compared by the media to the reigning sex symbol of the period, Marilyn Monroe [27] 20th Century Fox groomed her, as well as Sheree North, to substitute for Monroe, their resident \"blonde bombshell\", while Universal Pictures launched Van Doren as their substitute [304] The studio launched Mansfield with a grand 40-day tour of England and Europe from September 25 to November 6, 1957 [305] She adopted Monroe's vocal mannerisms instead of her original husky voice and Texas accent, [265] performed in two plays that were based on Marilyn Monroe vehicles – Bus Stop and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes [306] – and her role in The Wayward Bus was strongly influenced by Monroe's character in Bus Stop [117]\n\n\nDeath\nOn June 28, 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an engagement at the Gus Stevens Supper Club After midnight, Mansfield, her attorney and partner Sam Brody (age 40), a driver for the Gus Stevens Supper Club named Ronald B Harrison (age 19), three of her children (Miklós (age 8), Zoltán (age 6), and Mariska (age 3)) and her four Chihuahua dogs left Biloxi in a 1966 Buick Electra 225  They were headed to New Orleans where Mansfield was to appear on WDSU's Midday Show At about 2:25 a.m on June 29, on U.S Highway 90, 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed while it was traveling between 60 and 80 miles per hour (97 and 129 km/h)  It ran  into the rear of a Johnson Motor Freight Lines tractor-trailer that had slowed down from 50 to 35 miles per hour (80 to 56 km/h) due to an approaching mosquito insecticide fog-spraying truck which was flashing a red light The three adults in the front seat and two of the dogs died instantly The children, asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries [317] [318] [319]\n\n\nAchievements and legacy\nMansfield left behind five children and a crumbling estate, [340] [341] [342] including the Pink Palace The 1991 US top 40 single \"Kiss Them for Me\" by the group Siouxsie and the Banshees

gain control of her estate [347] [348] [349] Mansfield's estate was appraised initially at $600,000 ($4.5 million in 2023 dollars), [6] including the Pink Palace, estimated at $100,000 ($750,000 in 2023 dollars), a sports car sold for $7,000 ($53,000 in 2023 dollars), her jewelry, and Sam Brody's $185,000 estate left to her in his last will ($1,390,000 in 2023 dollars) [350] [351] In 1971,

However, her four eldest children (Jayne Marie, Mickey, Zoltan, and Mariska) went to court in 1977 to find that approximately $500,000 in debt that Mansfield had incurred ($3.8 million in 2023 dollars), including $11,000 for lingerie ($83,000 in 2023 dollars), $11,600 for plumbing of the heart-shaped swimming pool ($87,000 in 2023 dollars), and litigation had left the estate insolvent

eyebrows dyed platinum [250] Following Jean Harlow (who started the trend with her film Bombshell), [251] [252] Monroe, Mansfield, and Van Doren helped establish the stereotype typified by a combination of curvaceous physique, very light-colored hair, and a perceived lack of intelligence [253] A review of English-language tabloids shows it to be one of the most persistent blonde stereotypes – along with busty blonde, and blonde babe [254]\n\n\nBlonde\nA natural brunette, Mansfield had her hair bleached and colored platinum blonde when she moved to Los Angeles, [245] and

babe [254]\n\n\nAnatomy\nNewspapers in the 1950s routinely published Mansfield's body measurements, which once led evangelist Billy Graham to exclaim, \"This country knows more about Jayne Mansfield's statistics than the Second Commandment.\" [242] Mansfield proclaimed a 41-inch bust line and a 22-inch waist when she made her Broadway debut in 1955, though some scholars dispute those figures [265] She was known as \"the Cleavage Queen\" and \"the Queen of Sex and Bosom\" [266]\n\n\nPublicity\nMansfield's drive for publicity was one of the strongest in Hollywood She gave up all privacy, and her doors were always open to photographers [138] [277] On Christmas Eve 1954, she walked into publicist James Byron's office with a gift and asked him to oversee her publicity, [138] which he did, for the most part, until the end of 1961 [127] Byron appointed most of the people on her team – William Shiffrin (press agent), Greg Bautzer (attorney) and Charles Goldring (business manager) [278] – and constantly planted publicity material in the media [277] She appeared in about 2,500 newspaper photographs, and had about 122,000 lines of newspaper copy written about her between September 1956 and May 1957 [242]\n\n\nPublicity stunts\nIn January 1955, Mansfield appeared at a Silver Springs, Florida, press junket promoting the film Underwater!, starring Jane Russell She purposely wore a too-small red bikini, lent to her by photographer friend Peter Gowland When she dove into the pool for photographers, her top came off, creating a burst of media attention The ensuing publicity led to Warner Bros and Playboy approaching her with offers [178] [242] [286] [287] On June 8 of the same year, her dress fell down to her waist twice in a single evening – once at a movie party, and later at a nightclub [288] In February 1958, she was topless at a Carnival party in Rio de Janeiro [25] [289] [290] She shimmied out of her polka-dot dress in a Rome nightclub in June 1962 [291] [292] In the three years since making her Broadway debut in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, Mansfield had become the most controversial star of the decade [279]\n\n\nSignature color\nMansfield adopted pink as her color in 1954, and was associated with it for the rest of her career [40] [299] Her original choice was purple, but she thought it too close to lavender, Kim Novak's signature color [40] \"It must have been the right decision,\" she said, \"because I got more column space from pink than Kim Novak ever did from lavender.\" [299] In November 1957, shortly before their marriage, using money from an inheritance, Mansfield bought the 40-room Mediterranean-style mansion (formerly owned by Rudy Vallée) at 10100 Sunset Boulevard in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles [75] [300] Mansfield had the house painted pink, with cupids surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink fur in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub, and a fountain spurting pink champagne; she then dubbed it the \"Pink Palace\" Hargitay (a plumber and carpenter before taking up bodybuilding) built the pink heart-shaped swimming pool The year after reconstructing the \"Pink Palace\" as a \"pink landmark\", she began riding in a pink Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible with tailfins, then the only pink Cadillac in Hollywood [301] [302] [303]\n\n\nRivalry\nThroughout her career, Mansfield was compared by the media to the reigning sex symbol of the period, Marilyn Monroe [27] 20th Century Fox groomed her, as well as Sheree North, to substitute for Monroe, their resident \"blonde bombshell\", while Universal Pictures launched Van Doren as their substitute [304] The studio launched Mansfield with a grand 40-day tour of England and Europe from September 25 to November 6, 1957 [305] She adopted Monroe's vocal mannerisms instead of her original husky voice and Texas accent, [265] performed in two plays that were based on Marilyn Monroe vehicles – Bus Stop and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes [306] – and her role in The Wayward Bus was strongly influenced by Monroe's character in Bus Stop [117]\n\n\nDeath\nOn June 28, 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an engagement at the Gus Stevens Supper Club After midnight, Mansfield, her attorney and partner Sam Brody (age 40), a driver for the Gus Stevens Supper Club named Ronald B Harrison (age 19), three of her children (Miklós (age 8),

of a Johnson Motor Freight Lines tractor-trailer that had slowed down from 50 to 35 miles per hour (80 to 56 km/h) due to an approaching mosquito insecticide fog-spraying truck which was flashing a red light The three adults in the front seat and two of the dogs died instantly The children, asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries [317] [318] [319]\n\n\nAchievements and

family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State [5] Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved

then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State [5] Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister [5]\n\n\nChildhood\nAs a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.\" [15] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind Gandhi writes: \"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number.\" Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters [16] [17]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas Gandhi was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba\", and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time [28] In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies [29] Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.\" As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband [30]\n\n\nThree years in London\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay [37] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London [35] [38] In July 1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal [39] Gandhi's mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol, and women Gandhi's brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing [35] [40]\n\n\nStudent of law\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay [37] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London [35] [38] In July 1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal [39] Gandhi's

offered to support him Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing [35] [40]\n\n\nVegetarianism and committee work\nHis vow to his mother influenced Gandhi's time in London Gandhi tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons [46] However, he didn't appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, Gandhi joined the London Vegetarian Society (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills [47] An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter [48] Some of the vegetarians Gandhi met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original [47]\n\n\nCalled to the bar\nGandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from Gandhi [47] His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because Gandhi was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but Gandhi was forced to stop after running afoul of British officer Sam Sunny [47] [48]\n\n\nCivil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)\nIn April 1893, Gandhi, aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin [51] [52] Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa where he developed his political views, ethics, and politics [53] [54] During this time Gandhi briefly returned to India in 1902 to mobilise support for the welfare of Indians in South Africa [55]\n\n\nEuropeans, Indians and Africans\nGandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa Initially, Gandhi was not interested in politics, but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights Gandhi entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress [71] According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious in some cases He suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa Like with other coloured people, white officials denied Gandhi his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called Gandhi a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets People would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate [72]\n\n\nStruggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)\nAt the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to Gandhi by C F Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915 He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.\n\n\nRole in World War I\nIn April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi [86] Gandhi agreed to support the war effort [37] [87] In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", Gandhi wrote: \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them.. If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army.\" [88] However, Gandhi stipulated in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.\" [89]\n\n\nChamparan agitations\nGandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration The peasants were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities [92]\n\n\nKheda agitations\nIn 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, [93] organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel [94] Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners [95]\n\n\nKhilafat movement\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18 Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war [96] This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I [97] The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi [98] He announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial.\" [99]\n\n\nNon-co-operation\nWith his book Hind Swaraj (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj (Indian independence) would come [4] [115]\n\n\nSalt Satyagraha (Salt March/Civil Disobedience Movement)\nAfter his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj over the second half of the 1920s He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal [124] After Gandhi's support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach [101] [125] While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two [124]\n\n\nGandhi as folk hero\nIndian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure [133]\n\n\nNegotiations\nThe government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931 The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers [137]\n\n\nRound Table Conferences\nDuring the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians [140] The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India [141] They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B R Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables [140] Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule [142] [143]\n\n\nCongress politics\nIn 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership He did not disagree with the party's position, but felt that if he resigned, Gandhi's popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj [150]\n\n\nWorld War II and  Quit India movement\nGandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II [155] The British government responded with the arrests of Gandhi and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement [156] A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government [157] While Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5 million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, the movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by the British regime and it ultimately paved the way for Indian independence [155] [157]\n\n\nPartition and independence\nGandhi opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines [167] [171] [172] The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India However, the All-India Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India.\" [173] [174] Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority [175]\n\n\nDeath\nAt 5:17 p.m on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest from a pistol at close range [191] [192] According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly [193] [194] In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom There, he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures [195] [196] [197] [198] [183]\n\n\nFuneral and memorials\nGandhi's death was mourned nationwide [196] [197] [198] [183] Over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where Gandhi was assassinated, and another million watched the procession pass by [214] His body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of Gandhi's body The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead, four drag-ropes held by 50 people each pulled the vehicle [215] All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London [216]\n\n\nPrinciples, practices, and beliefs\nGandhi's spirituality was greatly based on his embracement of the five great vows of Jainism and Hindu Yoga philosophy, viz Satya (truth), ahimsa (nonviolence), brahmacharya (celibacy), asteya (non-stealing), and aparigraha (non-attachment) [227] He stated that \"Unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all.\" [227] Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him Some writers present Gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances [228] [229]\n\n\nTruth and Satyagraha\nGandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement satyagraha, which means \"appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth.\" [230] The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which Gandhi tabled as \"Resolution on Non-cooperation\" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma [231]\n\n\nNonviolence\nAlthough Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale [254] [255] The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, and is considered the highest dharma (ethical value/virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought [256] Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth [257] [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nLiterary works\nGandhi was a prolific writer His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities [263] One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became \"the intellectual blueprint\" for India's independence movement The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read \"No Rights Reserved\" [264] For decades, Gandhi edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi Gandhi also wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers [265]\n\n\nLegacy\nGandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India [f] American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as \"India's greatest revolutionary nationalist leader\" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha [278] In 1999, Gandhi was named \"Asian of the century\" by Asiaweek [279] In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium [280] [281]\n\n\nFollowers and international influence\nGandhi influenced important leaders and political movements [260] Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence [304] [305] [306] King said, \"Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics.\" [307] King sometimes referred to Gandhi as \"the little brown saint.\" [308] Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi [309] Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel, [310] and Aung San Suu Kyi [311]\n\n\nGlobal days that celebrate Gandhi\nIn 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, as \"the International Day of Nonviolence\" [323] First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), [324] 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries [325] In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March [325]\n\n\nAwards\nTime magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930 [281] In the same magazine's 1999 list of The Most Important People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi \"the greatest man of our age.\" [326] The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D in 1937 [327] The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient In 2003, Gandhi was posthumously awarded with the World Peace Prize [328] Two years later, he was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Companions of O R Tambo [329] In 2011, Gandhi topped the TIME's list of top 25 political icons of all time [330]\n\n\nFather of the Nation\nIndians widely describe Gandhi as the Father of the Nation [335] [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as \"The Father of the Nation\" [341] On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as \"Father of the Nation\" [342] [343] He is also conferred the title \"Bapu\" [338] (Gujarati: endearment for father, [339] papa [339] [340]).\n\n\nFilm, theatre, and literature\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics [362] but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory Reporter Jim Yardley notes that \"modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power.\" By contrast, Gandhi is \"given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy.\" [363]\n\n\nCurrent impact within India\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics [362] but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory Reporter

known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a prominent Indian independence activist, leader of the Indian National Congress, and the pioneering advocate of non-violent civil disobedience. He played a key role in India's struggle for independence from British rule, inspiring movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance, which he called \"satyagraha,\" has inspired countless individuals, from Martin Luther King Jr. to Nelson Mandela, and continues to be a guiding force in the global pursuit of peace and justice.\n\n**Early Life and Background**\n\nGandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a small coastal town in the state of Gujarat, India. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, was a chief minister of the state of Porbandar, while his mother, Putlibai Gandhi, was a devout Hindu. Gandhi's family was of the Vaishya caste, a merchant community, and was considered to be of moderate means. Gandhi's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and spirituality, with his parents encouraging him to read and study from an early age.\n\n### Parents\n\nGandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822-1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State. Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.\n\n### Childhood\n\nAs a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about.\" One of his favorite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears. The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.\n\n### Marriage\n\nIn May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas Gandhi was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba,\" and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.\" As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.\n\n**Three Years in London**\n\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal. Gandhi's mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol, and women. Gandhi's brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.\n\n**Vegetarianism and Committee Work**\n\nHis vow to his mother influenced Gandhi's time in London. Gandhi tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he didn't appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, Gandhi joined the London Vegetarian Society (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter.\n\n**Called to the Bar**\n\nGandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from Gandhi. His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because Gandhi was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses.

Using non-cooperation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.\n\n**Khilafat Movement**\n\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi sought political cooperation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the war. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917-18. Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war. This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.\n\n**Non-Cooperation**\n\nWith his book Hind Swaraj (1909), Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the cooperation of Indians and had survived only because of this cooperation. If Indians refused to cooperate, British rule would collapse, and swaraj (Indian independence) would come.\n\n**Salt Satyagraha (Salt March/Civil Disobedience Movement)**\n\nAfter his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj over the second half of the 1920s. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal.\n\n**Gandhi as Folk Hero**\n\nIndian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu-speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.\n\n**Negotiations**\n\nThe government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress.\n\n**Round Table Conferences**\n\nDuring the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931-32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables.\n\n**Congress Politics**\n\nIn 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position, but felt that if he resigned, Gandhi's popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.\n\n**World War II and Quit India Movement**\n\nGandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II. The British government responded with the arrests of Gandhi and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement. A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government. While Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5 million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, the movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by the British regime and it ultimately paved the way for Indian independence.\n\n**Partition and Independence**\n\nGandhi opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the All-India Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India.\" Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to cooperate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority.\n\n**Death**\n\nAt 5:17 p.m. on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mahatma_Gandhi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and background\nGandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state [3] [4] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State [5] Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister [5]\n\n\nParents\nGandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state [3] [4] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State [5] Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister [5]\n\n\nChildhood\nAs a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.\" [15] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind Gandhi writes: \"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number.\" Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters [16] [17]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas Gandhi was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba\", and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time [28] In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies [29] Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.\" As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband [30]\n\n\nThree years in London\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay [37] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London [35] [38] In July 1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal [39] Gandhi's mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol, and women Gandhi's brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing [35] [40]\n\n\nStudent of law\nGandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay [37] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London [35] [38] In July 1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal [39] Gandhi's mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but Gandhi wanted to go To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol, and women Gandhi's brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing [35] [40]\n\n\nVegetarianism and committee work\nHis vow to his mother influenced Gandhi's time in London Gandhi tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons [46] However, he didn't appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, Gandhi joined the London Vegetarian Society (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills [47] An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter [48] Some of the vegetarians Gandhi met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original [47]\n\n\nCalled to the bar\nGandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from Gandhi [47] His attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because Gandhi was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but Gandhi was forced to stop after running afoul of British officer Sam Sunny [47] [48]\n\n\nCivil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914)\nIn April 1893, Gandhi, aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin [51] [52] Gandhi spent 21 years in South Africa where he developed his political views, ethics, and politics [53] [54] During this time Gandhi briefly returned to India in 1902 to mobilise support for the welfare of Indians in South Africa [55]\n\n\nEuropeans, Indians and Africans\nGandhi focused his attention on Indians and Africans while he was in South Africa Initially, Gandhi was not interested in politics, but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights Gandhi entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress [71] According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious in some cases He suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa Like with other coloured people, white officials denied Gandhi his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called Gandhi a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets People would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate [72]\n\n\nStruggle for Indian independence (1915–1947)\nAt the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to Gandhi by C F Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915 He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.\n\n\nRole in World War I\nIn April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi [86] Gandhi agreed to support the war effort [37] [87] In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", Gandhi wrote: \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them.. If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army.\" [88] However, Gandhi stipulated in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.\" [89]\n\n\nChamparan agitations\nGandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration The peasants were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities [92]\n\n\nKheda agitations\nIn 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, [93] organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel [94] Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners [95]\n\n\nKhilafat movement\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18 Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war [96] This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I [97] The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi [98] He announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial.\" [99]\n\n\nNon-co-operation\nWith his book Hind Swaraj (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj (Indian independence) would come [4] [115]\n\n\nSalt Satyagraha (Salt March/Civil Disobedience Movement)\nAfter his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj over the second half of the 1920s He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal [124] After Gandhi's support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach [101] [125] While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two [124]\n\n\nGandhi as folk hero\nIndian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure [133]\n\n\nNegotiations\nThe government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with Gandhi The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931 The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers [137]\n\n\nRound Table Conferences\nDuring the discussions between Gandhi and the British government over 1931–32 at the Round Table Conferences, Gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians [140] The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India [141] They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B R Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables [140] Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule [142] [143]\n\n\nCongress politics\nIn 1934, Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership He did not disagree with the party's position, but felt that if he resigned, Gandhi's popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj [150]\n\n\nWorld War II and  Quit India movement\nGandhi opposed providing any help to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II [155] The British government responded with the arrests of Gandhi and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement [156] A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against the British government [157] While Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5 million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, the movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by the British regime and it ultimately paved the way for Indian independence [155] [157]\n\n\nPartition and independence\nGandhi opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines [167] [171] [172] The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India However, the All-India Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India.\" [173] [174] Gandhi suggested an agreement which required the Congress and the Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority [175]\n\n\nDeath\nAt 5:17 p.m on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest from a pistol at close range [191] [192] According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly [193] [194] In other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom There, he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures [195] [196] [197] [198] [183]\n\n\nFuneral and memorials\nGandhi's death was mourned nationwide [196] [197] [198] [183] Over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where Gandhi was assassinated, and another million watched the procession pass by [214] His body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of Gandhi's body The engine of the vehicle was not used; instead, four drag-ropes held by 50 people each pulled the vehicle [215] All Indian-owned establishments in London remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India House in London [216]\n\n\nPrinciples, practices, and beliefs\nGandhi's spirituality was greatly based on his embracement of the five great vows of Jainism and Hindu Yoga philosophy, viz Satya (truth), ahimsa (nonviolence), brahmacharya (celibacy), asteya (non-stealing), and aparigraha (non-attachment) [227] He stated that \"Unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all.\" [227] Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him Some writers present Gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances [228] [229]\n\n\nTruth and Satyagraha\nGandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement satyagraha, which means \"appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth.\" [230] The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which Gandhi tabled as \"Resolution on Non-cooperation\" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma [231]\n\n\nNonviolence\nAlthough Gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale [254] [255] The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, and is considered the highest dharma (ethical value/virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought [256] Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth [257] [258] [259] [260]\n\n\nLiterary works\nGandhi was a prolific writer His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities [263] One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became \"the intellectual blueprint\" for India's independence movement The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read \"No Rights Reserved\" [264] For decades, Gandhi edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi Gandhi also wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers [265]\n\n\nLegacy\nGandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India [f] American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as \"India's greatest revolutionary nationalist leader\" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha [278] In 1999, Gandhi was named \"Asian of the century\" by Asiaweek [279] In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium [280] [281]\n\n\nFollowers and international influence\nGandhi influenced important leaders and political movements [260] Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence [304] [305] [306] King said, \"Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics.\" [307] King sometimes referred to Gandhi as \"the little brown saint.\" [308] Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was inspired by Gandhi [309] Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel, [310] and Aung San Suu Kyi [311]\n\n\nGlobal days that celebrate Gandhi\nIn 2007, the United Nations General Assembly declared Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, as \"the International Day of Nonviolence\" [323] First proposed by UNESCO in 1948, as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace (DENIP in Spanish), [324] 30 January is observed as the School Day of Nonviolence and Peace in schools of many countries [325] In countries with a Southern Hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 March [325]\n\n\nAwards\nTime magazine named Gandhi the Man of the Year in 1930 [281] In the same magazine's 1999 list of The Most Important People of the Century, Gandhi was second only to Albert Einstein, who had called Gandhi \"the greatest man of our age.\" [326] The University of Nagpur awarded him an LL.D in 1937 [327] The Government of India awarded the annual Gandhi Peace Prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-Indian recipient In 2003, Gandhi was posthumously awarded with the World Peace Prize [328] Two years later, he was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Companions of O R Tambo [329] In 2011, Gandhi topped the TIME's list of top 25 political icons of all time [330]\n\n\nFather of the Nation\nIndians widely describe Gandhi as the Father of the Nation [335] [336] [337] [338] [339] [340] Origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on Singapore radio) on 6 July 1944 by Subhash Chandra Bose where Bose addressed Gandhi as \"The Father of the Nation\" [341] On 28 April 1947, Sarojini Naidu during a conference also referred Gandhi as \"Father of the Nation\" [342] [343] He is also conferred the title \"Bapu\" [338] (Gujarati: endearment for father, [339] papa [339] [340]).\n\n\nFilm, theatre, and literature\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics [362] but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory Reporter Jim Yardley notes that \"modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power.\" By contrast, Gandhi is \"given full credit for India's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy.\" [363]\n\n\nCurrent impact within India\nIndia, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected Gandhi's economics [362] but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory Reporter Jim Yardley notes that \"modern India is hardly a Gandhian nation, if it ever was one His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call

and an author of Gandhi's biography titled Mohandas, [369] while another, Tarun Gandhi, has authored several authoritative books on his grandfather Another grandson, Kanu Ramdas Gandhi (the son of Gandhi's third son Ramdas), was found living at an old age home in Delhi despite having taught earlier in the United States [370] [371]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExplanatory

PepsiCo, Inc.\n\nLeonard v. PepsiCo, Inc. is a 1997 trademark and contract dispute case between Leonard, a consumer, and PepsiCo, Inc., a multinational food and beverage corporation. The case revolved around a popular advertising campaign for Pepsi, which introduced the concept of \"Pepsi Points\" and a Harrier Jet giveaway promotion.\n\nBackground\n================\n\nOn September 22, 1996, PepsiCo, Inc., launched a new advertising campaign for its soft drink, Pepsi, which included a promotion offering a Harrier Jet to customers who collected a certain number of Pepsi Points. The campaign, which became known as the \"Pepsi Generation\" campaign, also included a memorable television commercial featuring a Harrier Jet landing in a schoolyard and a faculty member being blown away by the wind generated by the jet's landing.\n\nProcedural History\n================\n\nThe case began when Leonard, a consumer, submitted a claim to the New York Supreme Court alleging both breach of contract and fraud. The claim was based on the idea that the Pepsi Points promotion constituted an offer that Leonard had accepted, and that PepsiCo had breached its contractual obligations by not delivering the Harrier Jet. The case was eventually transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where it was heard by Judge Kimba Wood.\n\nThe defendant, PepsiCo, Inc., moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, arguing that the promotion was not an offer, but rather an invitation to participate in a game or contest. Leonard argued that the promotion was an offer that had been accepted, and that the court had jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nLeonard also claimed that a federal judge was incapable of deciding on the matter, and that instead the decision had to be made by a jury consisting of members of the \"Pepsi Generation\" to whom the advertisement would allegedly constitute an offer. However, Judge Wood rejected this argument, ruling that the promotion was not an offer, but rather an invitation to participate in a game or contest.\n\nJudgment\n-------\n\nThe court, presided over by Judge Kimba Wood, rejected Leonard's claims and denied recovery on several grounds. The court ruled that the promotion was not an offer, but rather an invitation to participate in a game or contest, and that Leonard had not accepted the offer in the manner required by the promotion.\n\nThe court also rejected Leonard's claims of breach of contract, ruling that there was no valid contract between Leonard and PepsiCo. The court further ruled that Leonard's claims of fraud were without merit, as there was no evidence that PepsiCo had made any false representations to Leonard.\n\nAftermath\n--------\n\nPepsi never cashed the check, so there was no case for fraud. Pepsi continued to air the commercial, but it updated the cost of the Harrier Jet to 700 million Pepsi Points and added a clarifying \"Just Kidding\" disclaimer. The Pentagon stated that the Harrier Jet would not be sold to civilians without \"demilitarization\", which, in the case of the Harrier, would have included stripping it of its ability to land and take off vertically.\n\nThe case highlights the importance of clearly defining the terms and conditions of promotions and contests, and of ensuring that consumers understand the rules and requirements of participating in such promotions. It also underscores the need for clear and concise language in advertising and marketing campaigns to avoid confusion and misinterpretation.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nThe Leonard v. PepsiCo case had a significant impact on the advertising and marketing industries. It highlighted the importance of clearly defining the terms and conditions of promotions and contests, and of ensuring that consumers understand the rules and requirements of participating in such promotions.\n\nThe case also led to changes in the way that companies conduct their promotions and contests. Many companies began to include more detailed and clear language in their advertising and marketing campaigns, and to provide more information to consumers about the rules and requirements of participating in their promotions.\n\nIn addition, the case led to changes in the way that courts handle cases related to advertising and marketing. Courts began to take a more nuanced approach to interpreting the terms and conditions of promotions and contests, and to consider the context in which the promotion was made.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe Leonard v. PepsiCo case is a landmark case that highlights the importance of clearly defining the terms and conditions of promotions and contests. It underscores the need for clear and concise language in advertising and marketing campaigns to avoid confusion and misinterpretation.\n\nThe case also highlights the importance of ensuring that consumers understand the rules and requirements of participating in such promotions. It serves as a reminder to companies to be clear and transparent in their advertising and marketing campaigns, and to provide consumers with accurate and complete information about their promotions.\n\nUltimately, the Leonard v. PepsiCo case is a reminder that advertising and marketing campaigns must be carefully crafted and executed to avoid confusion and misinterpretation. It serves as a warning to companies to be mindful of the potential consequences of their actions, and to take steps to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Leonard_v._Pepsico,_Inc.\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe Harrier Jet is not yet visible, but the observer senses the presence of a mighty plane as the extreme winds generated by its flight create a paper maelstrom in a classroom devoted to an otherwise dull physics lesson Finally, the Harrier Jet swings into view and lands by the side of the school building, bombing everything in sight next to a bicycle rack Several students run for cover, and the velocity of the wind strips one hapless faculty member down to his underwear While the faculty member is being deprived of his dignity, the voiceover announces: \"Now the more Pepsi you drink, the more great stuff you're gonna get.\"\n\n\nProcedural history\nThe claim alleged both breach of contract and fraud  The case was originally brought in Florida, but eventually heard in New York The defendant, PepsiCo, moved for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 Among other claims made, Leonard claimed that a federal judge was incapable of deciding on the matter, and that instead the decision had to be made by a jury consisting of members of the \"Pepsi Generation\" to whom the advertisement would allegedly constitute an offer [6]\n\n\nJudgment\nThe court, presided over by Judge Kimba Wood, rejected Leonard's claims and denied recovery on several grounds, including:\n\n\nAftermath\nPepsi never cashed the check, so there was no case for fraud Pepsi continued to air the commercial, but it updated the cost of the Harrier Jet to 700 million Pepsi Points [9] and added a clarifying \"Just Kidding\" disclaimer The Pentagon stated that the Harrier Jet would not be sold to civilians without \"demilitarization\", which, in the case of the Harrier, would have included stripping it of its ability to land and take off vertically [10]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

And then, Warner signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia – no matter what!

journalist Robert Christgau described Raitt's voice as not particularly beautiful but \"textured\", capable of shouting, crooning, \"carry [ing] a tune or fill [ing] a room\" [43] Christgau likened

has been sober since 1987 She has credited Stevie Ray Vaughan for breaking her substance abuse, saying that what gave her the courage to admit her alcohol problem and stop drinking was seeing that

However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between Warner Bros. and Columbia Records. \"There was this big Columbia–Warner war going on at the time,\" recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"James Taylor had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia.. And then, Warner signed Paul Simon away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia – no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"\n\n**Tongue and Groove and release from Warner Brothers**\n\nIn 1983, Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, Tongue and Groove. The day after mastering was completed on Tongue & Groove, the record company dropped Raitt from its roster, not being happy with her commercial performance up to that point. The album was shelved and not released, and Raitt was left without a record contract. At this time Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.\n\n**1989–1999: Commercial Breakthrough**\n\nAfter working with Was on the Stay Awake album, Raitt's management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal and found interest from Capitol Records. Raitt was signed to Capitol by A&R executive Tim Devine. With her first Capitol Records release, and after nearly twenty years in the business, Raitt achieved commercial success with Nick of Time, her tenth overall album of her career. Released in the spring of 1989, Nick of Time went to number one on the U.S. album chart following Raitt's Grammy sweep in early 1990. This album has also been voted number 230 in the Rolling Stone list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Raitt later stated that her 10th try was \"my first sober album.\"\n\n**2000–2007**\n\nIn March 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Silver Lining was released in 2002. In the US, it reached number 13 on the Billboard chart and was later certified Gold. It contains the singles \"I Can't Help You Now\", \"Time of Our Lives\", and the title track (a cover version of David Gray's original song). All three singles charted within the top 40 of the US Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n**2008–present**\n\nRaitt appeared on the June 7, 2008 broadcast of Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion. She performed two blues songs with Keb' Mo': \"No Getting Over You\" and \"There Ain't Nothin' in Ramblin'\". Raitt also sang \"Dimming of the Day\" with Richard Thompson. This show, along with another one with Raitt and her band in October 2006, is archived on the Prairie Home Companion website. Raitt appeared in the 2011 documentary Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals, which was featured on the BBC and described as \"The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica\".\n\n**Artistry**\n\nRaitt possesses a contralto vocal range. Music journalist Robert Christgau described Raitt's voice as not particularly beautiful but \"textured\", capable of shouting, crooning, \"carry [ing] a tune or fill [ing] a room\". Christgau likened her vocal style to \"a loving woman who has the touch, soft and hard at the right times in the right places\". Journalist Will Hermes described Raitt's voice as warm and precise. Describing her as a \"master interpreter of other writers' songs\", Chris Hansen Orf of The Arizona Republic note that Raitt is equally skilled at singing blues, folk, country, rock, and pop music. Kevin McKeough of the Chicago Tribune observed that blues has \"remained the bedrock of all of Raitt's musical excursions\", with her voice alternating between \"sigh to a call to a sustained cry\". Discussing the ability of a singer to make use of her voice, singer Linda Ronstadt stated \"Of my own peers, Bonnie Raitt has way more musicianship than I do.\" Singer and guitarist David Crosby has said that Raitt is his favorite singer of all time.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRaitt has taken sabbaticals, including after the deaths of her parents, brother, and best friend. She has said \"When I went through a lot of loss, I took a hiatus.\" Raitt and actor Michael O'Keefe were married on April 27, 1991. They announced their divorce on November 9, 1999, with a factor appearing to be that their careers caused considerable time apart.\n\n**Drug and Alcohol Use and Recovery**\n\nRaitt was a user of alcohol and drugs, but began psychotherapy and joined Alcoholics Anonymous in the late 1980s. \"I thought I had to live that partying lifestyle in order to be authentic,\" she said, \"but in fact if you keep it up too long, all you're going to be is sloppy or dead.\" She has been sober since 1987. She has credited Stevie Ray Vaughan for breaking her substance abuse, saying that what gave her the courage to admit her alcohol problem and stop drinking was seeing that Vaughan was an even better musician when sober. She has also said that she stopped because she realized that the \"late night life\" was not working for her. In 1989, she said, \"I really feel like some angels have been carrying me around. I just have more focus and more discipline, and consequently more self-respect.\"\n\n**Political Activism**\n\nRaitt's political involvement goes back to the early 1970s. Her 1972 album Give It Up had a dedication \"to the people of North Vietnam...\" printed on the back. Raitt's web site urges fans to learn more about preserving the environment. She was a founding member of Musicians United for Safe Energy in 1979 and a catalyst for the larger anti-nuclear movement, becoming involved with groups like the Abalone Alliance and Alliance for Survival. In 1994 at the urging of Dick Waterman, Raitt funded the replacement of a headstone for one of her mentors, blues guitarist Fred McDowell through the Mt Zion Memorial Fund. Raitt later financed memorial headstones in Mississippi for musicians Memphis Minnie, Sam Chatmon, and Tommy Johnson again with the Mt Zion Memorial Fund.\n\n**Discography**\n\nRaitt's principal touring guitar is a customized Fender Stratocaster that she nicknamed Brownie. This became the basis for a signature model in 1996. Raitt was the first female musician to receive a signature Fender line.\n\n**Awards**\n\nRaitt has received numerous awards and accolades throughout her career, including 14 Grammy nominations and three Grammy wins. She has also been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Blues Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bonnie_Raitt\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBonnie Lynn Raitt was born on November 8, 1949, in Burbank, California [6] Her mother, Marge Goddard (née Haydock), was a pianist, and her father, John Raitt, was a professional actor and singer in musical productions such as Oklahoma! and The Pajama Game [7] Raitt is of Scottish ancestry; her ancestors constructed Rait Castle near Nairn [8] As a child, Raitt would often play with her two brothers, Steve and David and was a self-described tomboy [9] John Raitt's job as a theater actor meant Bonnie did not interact with him as much as she would have liked Raitt grew to resent her mother, as she became the main authority figure of the household whenever John was away [10]\n\n\nCareer\nIn the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand-up bass with Mississippi Fred McDowell at the Philadelphia Folk Festival as well as opening for John Hammond at the Gaslight Cafe in New York She was seen by a reporter from Newsweek, who began to spread the word about her performance Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play She eventually accepted an offer from Warner Bros., who soon released her debut album, Bonnie Raitt, in 1971 [18] The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\n\n1970–1976\nIn the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand-up bass with Mississippi Fred McDowell at the Philadelphia Folk Festival as well as opening for John Hammond at the Gaslight Cafe in New York She was seen by a reporter from Newsweek, who began to spread the word about her performance Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play She eventually accepted an offer from Warner Bros., who soon released her debut album, Bonnie Raitt, in 1971 [18] The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\n\n1977–1988\n1977's Sweet Forgiveness album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough, [18] when it yielded a hit single in her remake of \"Runaway\" Recast as a heavy rhythm and blues recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by Al Green, Raitt's version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between Warner Bros and Columbia Records \"There was this big Columbia–Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview \"James Taylor had just left Warner Bros and made a big album for Columbia..

The party was established during the 2019 presidential election campaign, and it has since become one of the dominant forces in Ukrainian politics. This article provides an overview of the party's history, ideology, and electoral performance.\n\n**History**\n\nLegally, the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change (Ukrainian: Партія рішучих змін) that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga. The Party of Decisive Change was a small, regional party that did not have much influence in Ukrainian politics. However, its legacy played a significant role in the establishment of Servant of the People.\n\n**Founding**\n\nThe founding of Servant of the People is closely tied to the 2019 presidential election campaign. In late December 2018, Zelenskyy was declared a presidential candidate from the party at the 2019 presidential election. While lagging behind in January 2019, Zelenskyy began to lead the polls by March. His campaign focused on issues such as corruption, poverty, and the country's economic stagnation. He promised to clean up the government, reduce bureaucracy, and increase transparency.\n\nThe party's name, Servant of the People, was inspired by the popular television series of the same name, in which Zelenskyy played the lead role. The show was a huge success in Ukraine, and it helped to establish Zelenskyy as a household name.\n\n**Party winning the 2019 presidential and parliamentary election**\n\nIn the first round of the presidential elections, Zelenskyy took first place, winning 30.24% of the votes. He went on to win the second round, defeating incumbent President Petro Poroshenko with 73.23% of the votes.\n\nFollowing his victory in the presidential election, Zelenskyy's party won a landslide victory in the 2019 parliamentary election. The party won 254 out of 424 seats in the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament.\n\n**Party since winning the 2019 parliamentary election**\n\nOn 11 November 2019, Oleksandr Korniyenko replaced Dmytro Razumkov as party chairman. Korniyenko is a close ally of Zelenskyy and has played a key role in shaping the party's policy.\n\nSince the parliamentary election, the party has focused on implementing its campaign promises. It has passed several laws aimed at reducing corruption, increasing transparency, and improving the business environment. The party has also established several new government agencies and institutions to oversee the implementation of its policies.\n\n**Ideology and position**\n\nServant of the People is positioned in the centre of the political spectrum. Its ideology has been described as populist and liberal. The party's populist approach has been characterized by its focus on issues that are important to ordinary people, such as corruption, poverty, and the economy.\n\nThe party's liberal approach has been reflected in its support for market-oriented economic policies and its commitment to human rights and individual freedoms. However, some critics have accused the party of being too focused on short-term gains and neglecting long-term economic and social development.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\n### Verkhovna Rada\n\n| Election | Seats | Position |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | 254/424 | 1st |\n\n### Presidential elections\n\n| Election | Candidate | Votes | Position |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | Volodymyr Zelenskyy | 5,712,245 (73.23%) | 1st |\n\n**Notes**\n\nServant of the People has been described as a valence populist party, which means that it has leveraged popular discontent with the existing political system to win elections. However, some critics have accused the party of being too focused on short-term gains and neglecting long-term economic and social development.\n\nThe party has also been criticized for its lack of experience and its failure to implement some of its campaign promises. However, supporters of the party argue that it has made significant progress in reducing corruption and improving the business environment.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of Servant of the People", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Servant_of_the_People\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nLegally, the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change (Ukrainian: Партія рішучих змін) [4] [5] that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga [15]\n\n\nFounding\nLegally, the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change (Ukrainian: Партія рішучих змін) [4] [5] that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga [15]\n\n\nParty winning the 2019 presidential and parliamentary election\nIn late December 2018, Zelenskyy was declared a presidential candidate from the party at the 2019 presidential election [17] While lagging behind in January 2019, Zelenskyy began to lead the polls by March [18] He would go on to win the first round of the presidential elections, taking first place and moving on to the run off against incumbent President Poroshenko on 21 April 2019, [19] winning the election with over 73% of the votes cast [20] Zelenskyy stated that the party would enter a coalition government with neither the Petro Poroshenko Bloc nor Opposition Platform — For Life [21]\n\n\nParty since winning the 2019 parliamentary election\nOn 11 November 2019, Oleksandr Korniyenko replaced Razumkov as party chairman [38]\n\n\nIdeology and position\nIt is positioned in the centre on the political spectrum, [58] [59] [60] while its political ideology has been described as populist [61] [62] [63] and liberal [64] It has been described as a valence populist party [65]\n\n\nElectoral performance\n\n\nVerkhovna Rada\n\n\nPresidential elections\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The institute is situated in the heart of the city, near the Città Studi district, and is part of the IRCCS National Cancer Institute. In this article, we will delve into the history of AmadeoLab, its current research activities, and its contributions to the field of medicine.\n\n**Location**\n\nAmadeoLab is situated in Via Giovanni Antonio Amadeo 42, 20133 Milan, Italy, in the North-Eastern part of Milan, in Zone 3. The institute is close to the Ortica neighborhood, part of the municipality of Lambrate, and is adjacent to the departments of Milan University. The location of AmadeoLab is strategic, as it allows for close collaboration with the university and other research institutions in the area.\n\n**Name**\n\nAmadeoLab was named after Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, an Italian sculptor, engineer, and architect of the 15th century. Amadeo was born in Pavia in 1447 and was commissioned for numerous works, including the completion of the funeral chapel of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Bergamo. He is also known for carving the Certosa di Pavia and collaborating in the construction of Milan Cathedral. The name AmadeoLab is a testament to the institute's commitment to innovation and excellence.\n\n**History**\n\nBefore 1994, the Institute in Via Amadeo 42 was one of the main sites of the company Siemens, a company specialized in the design and production of radiological and electromedical equipment. In 1971, Siemens merged with Gorla Siama, the most important Italian Institute of the second post-war period, and established Siemens Spa-Divisione Gorla Siama. In 1994, the Lab in Milan was declared inactive, causing great concern for the employees. Two years later, in 1996, the company was sold to the General Medical Merate (GMM). The new company subsequently transferred its production from Milan (in Via Amadeo) to Seriate (in the province of Bergamo).\n\n**Siemens**\n\nSiemens was founded in 1847, in a back courtyard in the city of Berlin. The founders of the company, Ernst Werner Siemens, his cousin Johann Georg Siemens, and Johann Georg Halske, designed the industry to contribute to the technological innovation of Germany. The main focus was at first related to telegraphs and other electrical equipment, which made the Institution grow faster.

The building was inaugurated on September 15, 2010, and it is still working today. AmadeoLab consists of 11,000 square meters divided into several floors.\n\n**IRCCS National Cancer Institute**\n\nThe National Cancer Institute was established in 1928, through the work of the well-known doctor and scientist, Luigi Mangiagalli. Even though the first wards of the hospital were inaugurated on April 12, 1928, the main building was actually opened to the public in 1968 and consisted of twelve floors used as surgical, medical research, and radiology departments. In 1978, on its 50th anniversary, the INT was inserted in a range of International Institutes of research. During 2006, the INT changed its denomination becoming a foundation under public law, the IRCCS Foundation. A new building was opened in 2012, to incorporate the laboratories and research facilities of the Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine and of the Department of Preventive and Predictive Medicine. The new building also incorporated the Tumoral Tissues Biobank of the Regional Oncology Network, opened December 15, 2012, and funded with 1.5 million euros provided by Fondazione Cariplo and Lombardy region.\n\n**IRCCS Neurological Institute \"Carlo Besta\"**\n\nInside the laboratories in Via Amadeo 42, there are numerous research centers for the Carlo Besta Neurological Institute.

The Institute was founded in 1918 and has been classified since 1981 as a Scientific Institute of Medical Research. Some of the most important research laboratories are Epileptology and Experimental Neurophysiology. The main pathologies treated in the Institute are Epilepsy and Sleep Disturbances, other important laboratories inside the institute are the Neuroepidemiology held by the neurologist Alessandra Solari and the molecular neuro-oncology held by the neurologist Antonio Silvani.\n\n**Relevant researches**\n\nThe project aimed to establish a biobanking infrastructure, in order to investigate the procedures for quality controls in the field of Histology, specifically about tissue processing and the storing procedures. Their objective was to develop a hospital with a scientific data-based system.\n\n**Current research**\n\nSince 2009, the Institute's production and scientific research is growing and clinical trials have increased. Currently, the clinicians in the institute are performing research in the field of epilepsy with the model ADNFLE, which reproduces the main features of epilepsy. The goal is through neuroanatomical and biochemical methods, to analyze the protein alpha-synuclein, which is fundamental for the body to function normally, and it is often connected with Parkinson's disease. This research is also being done on post-surgical and post-mortem patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with different types of epilepsy. Professor Alida Amadeo, professor in human anatomy, is in charge of the research.

14 May 1962 – 23 August 2006) was an Austrian communications technician He was born to Karl and Waltraud Přiklopil in Vienna, and was an only child His father was a cognac salesman and his mother was a shoe saleswoman [35] Přiklopil worked at Siemens for a time as a communications technician.\n\n\nAftermath\nIn her official statement, Kampusch said, \"I don't want and will not answer any questions about personal or intimate details\" [40] After Kampusch's escape, police investigated whether Přiklopil had an accomplice, [41] but they eventually determined that he acted alone [42]\n\n\nInterviews\nAfter reportedly \"hundreds of requests for an interview\" with the teenager, \"with media outlets offering vast sums of money\", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster ORF The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval ORF did not pay a fee for its interview [49] but agreed to forward any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels, forecasted to total 300,000 euros, [50] to be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch [51] Likewise, she was planning projects to help these women [52] Interest was enormous [53]\n\n\nBooks\nThe book Girl in the Cellar: The Natascha Kampusch Story [58] by Allan Hall and Michael Leidig appeared in November 2006, written in English Kampusch's lawyer described the book as being both speculative and premature and therefore planned to take legal action against it [59]\n\n\nFilm adaptations\nOn 17 June 2010, German film-maker and director Bernd Eichinger announced that he was making a film based on Kampusch's captivity and wanted Kate Winslet to star in the film [64] The film was Eichinger's last before his sudden death on 24 January 2011; Kampusch attended his funeral [65]\n\n\nMedia endeavors\nKampusch established her own website containing personal information including pictures of herself on 5 December 2007 [70] She had her own talk show on the new Austria TV channel, PULS 4, starting on 1 June 2008 The show had the working title of In Conversation with…Natascha Kampusch and eventually premiered as Natascha Kampusch trifft (Natascha Kampusch meets...) [71] [72] It ran for three episodes.\n\n\nHouse\nThe house where Kampusch was imprisoned was built by Přiklopil's grandfather, Oskar Přiklopil, after World War II [35] During the Cold War period, Oskar and his son Karl built a bomb shelter, thought to be the origin of Kampusch's cellar prison Přiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

travelled through the canal, about 12 percent of total global trade at the time [4] [9] For much of its length, however, the canal is not wide enough to allow two ships to pass each other; convoys of ships must take turns transiting these segments of the waterway An expansion project is underway, but significant portions of the canal remain single-laned [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nIncident\nOn 23 March 2021, Ever Given was travelling from Tanjung Pelepas, Malaysia, to the Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands [36] [37] As it traversed the Suez Canal, it was fifth in a northbound convoy through the single-lane stretch, with fifteen vessels behind it [38] At 07:40 EGY (05:40 UTC), the ship was caught in a sandstorm Strong winds exceeding 40 kn (74 km/h; 46 mph) [39] resulted in the \"loss of the ability to steer the ship\", causing the hull to deviate [40] [36] [41] The ship ran aground at the 151 km (82 nmi) mark measured from Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea, 10 km (5.4 nmi) from Suez Port on the Gulf of Suez, near the village of Manshiyet Rugola [42] The ship turned sideways, unable to free itself, blocking the canal on both sides [40] The crew, consisting entirely of Indian nationals, was accounted for and no injuries were reported [43] [44]\n\n\nSalvage and refloating\nOn 25 March, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) suspended navigation through the canal until Ever Given could be refloated [52] [53] On the same day, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's advisor on seaports stated that he expected the canal to be cleared in \"48–72 hours, maximum\" [54] The Suez Canal Authority engaged the Dutch company Royal Boskalis Westminster through its subsidiary Smit Salvage to manage marine salvage operations Peter Berdowski, Chief Executive of Boskalis, stated on that such an operation \"can take days to weeks\" [55] On 26 March, the SCA accepted an offer made by a United States Navy assessment team of dredging experts to assist in efforts to remove the ship [56]\n\n\nLegal issues and seizure\nThrough April and May, the ship remained under seizure, pending a settlement for damages between the ship's owners and the Suez Canal Authority [78] [79] SCA head Osama Rabie demanded a billion-dollar compensation for lost revenue and the cost of the salvage operation, and warned that legal battles could prevent the departure of the ship Concerns were raised for the crew, who would be effectively detained until the incident was resolved [80]\n\n\nLegal compensation claims\nThrough April and May, the ship remained under seizure, pending a settlement for

that legal battles could prevent the departure of the ship Concerns were raised for the crew, who would be effectively detained until the incident was resolved [80]\n\n\nSeizure\nOn 13 April, the ship was seized by a court in Ismailia after a request by the SCA pending payment of compensations exceeding US$916 million, including $300 million for the salvage and $300 million for \"loss of reputation\" [83] [84] Marine industry specialists considered this an \"outrageous\" measure causing unnecessary duress to both the crew and cargo owners [85] The Indian crew members remained effectively detained on board, [84] although two of the 25 were allowed to depart on 15 April due to \"urgent personal circumstances\" [86] The ship's operator Evergreen was reportedly exploring options to transfer cargo to another ship to fulfill its delivery commitments, [57] but an Egyptian court confirmed that the arrest affected both the ship and its cargo [87]\n\n\nEconomic impact\n\nThe incident exposed a need to investigate issues of supply chain resilience and disruption to just-in-time manufacturing already facing shortages from COVID-19 pandemic impacts [103] The \"complete disconnect of ship size development from developments in the actual economy\" (OECD report, 2015 [104]), and the corresponding limitations of existing infrastructure to handle them – a process evident in the Suez, where expansion work on the northern end of the canal has been ongoing – led to the incident being described by Michael Safi in The Guardian as a \"worst-case scenario that many saw coming\" [76] \n\nRise in prices\nMaritime and logistics experts warned that the incident would likely result in shipping delays of everyday items for customers around the world [106] Maritime historian Sal Mercogliano told the Associated Press: \"Every day the canal is closed.. container ships and tankers are not delivering food, fuel and manufactured goods to Europe and goods are not being exported from Europe to the Far East.\" [36] [4] Lloyd's List estimated during the blockage the value of the goods delayed each hour at US$400 million, [107] [108] and that every day it takes to clear the obstruction would disrupt an additional US$9 billion worth of goods [47] [109] Rabie estimated that Egypt lost $12–14 million per day due to the closure [110] The SCA calculated it lost approximately US$15 million per day in transit fees [84] Despite the blockage, overall revenue for the first six months of 2021 was up by 8.8% to US$3 billion when compared with the same period the previous year [111]\n\n\nKnock-on delays\nThe event delayed goods, which impacted industries with existing shortages, such as with semiconductors, thereby influencing markets already at risk of collapsing To mitigate shortages of goods in the long term, future shipments could be ordered earlier than normal until the difference has been made up [112] [114] However, a consultant at another firm noted that even a short-term disruption at the Suez Canal would have a domino effect for several months along the supply chain, [115] an effect already apparent in the weeks following the incident [116] This kind of disruption is not unique to the incident: the historical trend for shipping rates to rise after interruptions in the supply chain is well documented, and analysts such as Ioannis Theotokas of the University of Piraeus noted that the crisis \"led to a lot of losses for freight owners and charterers\", and that a prolonged closure could have had impacts similar to the 1967 Arab-Israeli War [117] Some freight forwarders noted that demand for alternative means of transportation was expected to rise within the next few weeks on Europe to Asia routes, as a consequence of shippers seeking to avoid the disruption and uncertainty caused by the blockage of the canal [118] Following the resolution of the incident, forwarders in India noted difficulties with securing shipments to Europe or Africa, with many prior bookings cancelled and increased freight rates hitting small and medium-sized exporters particularly harshly [119] In England and across Europe, supply chain disruption from the canal incident, coupled with an already increased interest in gardening due to COVID-19 lockdowns, led to a shortage of garden gnomes [120]\n\n\nAlternative routes\nThe default alternative route for maritime traffic between Asia and Europe is to go around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, a trip which can add up to two weeks to journey time, [49] with this alternative having already been taken by some ships as of 26 March [122] [123] [124] Russia used the incident to promote its Arctic shipping routes as a shorter alternative to carrying goods around Africa [125] [126]\n\n\nLivestock\nConcern was raised about livestock transported through the route, with 130,000 sheep being transported to Romania alone; Gabi Paun of Animals International stated \"Every hour counts for the sheep and the fatality rate will only grow .. even if the law was respected and the ships were carrying 25% more food .. it would nonetheless have been finished by now\" A previous 2020 report by the European Commission discovered many ships used for transporting animals were not fit for that purpose, and that oversight was lacking aboard ships of several member states, including Romania, France and Spain [129] Loading of livestock ships for export was temporarily suspended by the Romanian and Spanish authorities until the canal cleared [113]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nVarious internet memes about the incident have been published, alongside numerous jokes [130] [131] [132] [133] \"Ever Given Ever Ywhere\", a web app that allows users to place Ever Given

She went on to appear in five feature films released throughout 1991, including He Said, She Said, Scissors, Diary of a Hitman, Year of the Gun, and Where Sleeping Dogs Lie.\n\nLeading Lady Status (1993-1999)\n\nIn 1993, Stone played a femme fatale in the erotic thriller Sliver, based on Ira Levin's eponymous novel about the mysterious occurrences in a privately owned New York City high-rise apartment building.

Stone also made a cameo appearance in the action film Last Action Hero (1993), reuniting with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Far Out Magazine ranked Stone's role among one of her \"10 best performances,\" while New York Magazine remarked: \"Sharon Stone, playing a widow who's half-hippie, half-working-class-tough, demonstrates that, given the right part, she's still not merely sexy but knockabout funny and sly.\"\n\nPublic Image\n\nSharon Stone has appeared on the covers and pictorials of over 300 celebrity and fashion magazines throughout her four-decade acting career. She graced the June-July 1986 cover of French Vogue, and to coincide with the release of Total Recall, she posed nude for the July 1990 issue of Playboy, flaunting the muscles she had developed in preparation for the film.

Stone, who was Hurrell's reportedly last sitting before his death in 1992, is also a collector of the photographer's original prints and wrote the foreword to the book Hurrell's Hollywood.\n\nCriticism\n\nOn January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1 million in five minutes for mosquito nets in Tanzania, turning a panel on African poverty into an impromptu fundraiser at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Many observers, including UNICEF, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences, and methods of preventing malaria. Of the $1 million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise to send $1 million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000, which diverted funds from other UNICEF projects. According to prominent economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin, officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets. Some were delivered to the local airport, which reportedly were stolen and later resurfaced as wedding dresses on the local black market.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nSharon Stone is a Tibetan Buddhist, having been converted to Buddhism when Richard Gere introduced her to the Dalai Lama.

The couple separated three years later, and their divorce was finalized in 1990.\n\nActivism\n\nIn March 2006, Stone traveled to Israel to promote peace in the Middle East through a press conference with Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres. In 2013, she referred to Peres as her \"mentor.\" On October 23, 2013, Stone received the Peace Summit Award for her work for people with HIV/AIDS.\n\nSelected Filmography and Accolades\n\nIn a career spanning over four decades, Sharon Stone has had over one hundred acting credits in film and on television.

of six, Polanski attended primary school for only a few weeks, until \"all the Jewish children were abruptly expelled\", writes biographer Christopher Sandford That initiative was soon followed by the

{"title": "YouTube_Premium", "content": "\nHistory\nThe service was first unveiled in November 2014 as Music Key, serving as a collaboration between YouTube and Google Play Music, and meant to succeed the latter's own \"All Access\" service [13] Music Key offered ad-free playback of music videos from participating labels hosted on YouTube, as well as background and offline playback of music videos on mobile devices from within the YouTube app The service also included access to Google Play Music All Access, which provides ad-free audio streaming of a library of music [14] Alongside Music Key, Google also introduced tighter integration between Play Music and YouTube's apps, including the sharing of music recommendations, and access to YouTube's music videos from within the Play Music app [8] [9] Music Key was not YouTube's first foray into premium content, having launched film rentals in 2010, [15] and premium, subscription-based channels in 2013 [16]\n\n\nAs YouTube Premium\nOn June 18, 2018, YouTube rebranded the service as YouTube Premium The price of the service also changed from US$9.99 to US$11.99 per month for new subscribers The existing pricing, as well as bundling of YouTube Premium with Google Play Music, was grandfathered in some countries for those who subscribed prior to the rebranding Alongside the rebranding, the service also expanded into Canada, and 11 European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) [23] [24]\n\n\nFeatures\nA YouTube Premium subscription allows users to watch videos on YouTube without advertisements across the website and its mobile apps, including the dedicated YouTube Music and YouTube Kids apps and services Through the apps, users can also save videos to their device for offline viewing, play their audio in the background, and in picture-in-picture mode on Android Oreo and newer [34] [8] [9] YouTube Premium also offers original content that is exclusive to subscribers, which is created and published by YouTube's largest creators [35]\n\n\nContent\nYouTube Premium offers original films and series produced in collaboration with professional studios and YouTube personalities, [10] under the banner YouTube Originals For multi-episode series, the first episode of a YouTube Originals series is available free [10] In selected countries where the service is not yet available, individual episodes can also be purchased through YouTube or Google TV [36] Access to YouTube Originals is also included in YouTube's separate streaming television service YouTube TV, but a YouTube Premium subscription is still required for the service's other benefits [37]\n\n\nReception\nReception to YouTube Premium has been mixed amongst consumers and journalists alike David Nield of Wired argues that the premium service is worth it for consumers, saying that in addition to including a music streaming service, the lack of ads and the ability to download videos and having videos played in the background is useful for consumers YouTube releasing experimental features as well to subscribers was a benefit to Nield, which as of writing included the rollout of pinch to zoom in videos [41] Ashley Maready of The Motley Fool concurred with Nield in her review, while additionally noting that the benefits also extend out to YouTube Kids [42]\n\n\nLicensing terms for channels\nIn May 2014, prior to the official unveiling of the Music Key service, the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were \"undervalued\" in comparison to other streaming services, and stated that YouTube threatened to block a label's videos from public access if they did not agree to the new terms In a statement to the Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that these measures were \"to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms\" Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that \"while we wish that we had  [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience\" [47] [48] [49] [50] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service However, YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal [9]\n\n\nGeographic availability\nAs of March 2024, YouTube Premium is available in most of the Americas, Europe and Oceania, as well as parts of Africa and Asia, with a total availability in 119 markets [56] Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google indefinitely suspended all of its all payment and subscription-based services in the country, including YouTube Premium [57]

As of 2024, the service is available in 119 markets worldwide.\n\n**History**\n\nThe service was first unveiled in November 2014 as Music Key, serving as a collaboration between YouTube and Google Play Music. Music Key offered ad-free playback of music videos from participating labels hosted on YouTube, as well as background and offline playback of music videos on mobile devices from within the YouTube app. The service also included access to Google Play Music All Access, which provides ad-free audio streaming of a library of music. Alongside Music Key, Google also introduced tighter integration between Play Music and YouTube's apps, including the sharing of music recommendations, and access to YouTube's music videos from within the Play Music app.\n\nAs YouTube Premium\nOn June 18, 2018, YouTube rebranded the service as YouTube Premium. The price of the service also changed from US$9.99 to US$11.99 per month for new subscribers. The existing pricing, as well as bundling of YouTube Premium with Google Play Music, was grandfathered in some countries for those who subscribed prior to the rebranding. Alongside the rebranding, the service also expanded into Canada, and 11 European countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom).\n\n**Features**\n\nA YouTube Premium subscription allows users to watch videos on YouTube without advertisements across the website and its mobile apps, including the dedicated YouTube Music and YouTube Kids apps and services. Through the apps, users can also save videos to their device for offline viewing, play their audio in the background, and in picture-in-picture mode on Android Oreo and newer. YouTube Premium also offers original content that is exclusive to subscribers, which is created and published by YouTube's largest creators.\n\n## Original Content\n\nYouTube Originals is a content creation program that produces original films and series produced in collaboration with professional studios and YouTube personalities. The first episode of a YouTube Originals series is available for free, and individual episodes can also be purchased through YouTube or Google TV in selected countries where the service is not yet available.\n\n## Access to YouTube Originals\n\nAccess to YouTube Originals is included in YouTube's separate streaming television service YouTube TV, but a YouTube Premium subscription is still required for the service's other benefits.\n\n**Reception**\n\nReception to YouTube Premium has been mixed amongst consumers and journalists alike. David Nield of Wired argues that the premium service is worth it for consumers, saying that in addition to including a music streaming service, the lack of ads and the ability to download videos and having videos played in the background is useful for consumers. YouTube releasing experimental features as well to subscribers was a benefit to Nield, which as of writing included the rollout of pinch to zoom in videos.\n\nAshley Maready of The Motley Fool concurred with Nield in her review, while additionally noting that the benefits also extend out to YouTube Kids.\n\n**Licensing Terms for Channels**\n\nIn May 2014, prior to the official unveiling of the Music Key service, the independent music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were \"undervalued\" in comparison to other streaming services. The organization stated that YouTube threatened to block a label's videos from public access if they did not agree to the new terms.\n\nHowever, in a statement to the Financial Times, Robert Kyncl confirmed that these measures were \"to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms.\" Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that \"while we wish that we had [a] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience.\"\n\n**Geographic Availability**\n\nAs of March 2024, YouTube Premium is available in most of the Americas, Europe, and Oceania, as well as parts of Africa and Asia, with a total availability in 119 markets. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google indefinitely suspended all of its payment and subscription-based services in the country, including YouTube Premium.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* YouTube\n*

and club making, and instruction Allan Robertson was the most famous of these pros, and was regarded as the undisputed best golfer between 1843 and his death in 1859 [4] [3] James Ogilvie Fairlie of Prestwick Golf Club decided to form a competition in 1860, \"to be played for by professional golfers\", [5] and to decide who would succeed Robertson as the \"Champion Golfer\" Blackheath (England), Perth, Bruntsfield (Edinburgh), Musselburgh and St Andrews golf clubs were invited to send up to three of their best players known as a \"respectable caddie\" to represent each of the clubs [6] The winner received the Challenge Belt, made from red leather with a silver buckle and worth £25, which came about thanks to being donated by the Earl of Eglinton, a man with a keen interest in medieval pageantry (belts were the type of trophy that might have been competed for in archery or jousting) [7] [6]\n\n\nEarly tournament years (1860–1870)\nThe first Open Championship was played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland, over three rounds of the twelve-hole links course [3] In the mid-19th century golf was played mainly by well-off gentlemen, as hand-crafted clubs and

about thanks to being donated by the Earl of Eglinton, a man with a keen interest in medieval pageantry (belts were the type of trophy that might have been competed for in archery or jousting) [7] [6]\n\n\nThe introduction of course rotation and the Claret Jug (1872–1889)\nOn 11 September 1872 agreement was reached between Prestwick, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club They decided that each of the three clubs would contribute £10 towards the cost of a new silver trophy, which became known as the Claret Jug, known officially as The Golf Champion Trophy, and hosting of the Open would be rotated between the three clubs These decisions were taken too late for the trophy to be presented to the 1872 Open champion, who was once again Young Tom Morris Instead, he was awarded with a medal inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', although he is the first to be engraved on the Claret Jug as the 1872 winner Medals have been given to, and kept by the winner ever since [8] Young Tom Morris died in 1875, aged 24 [14]\n\n\nEnglish hosts and winners, and the Great Triumvirate (1890–1914)\nIn the 1890s, the tournament was won four times by three Englishman (two of whom were amateurs) [16] In 1892 the tournament was played for the first time at the newly built Muirfield, which replaced Musselburgh as the host venue used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers [17] A few years later St George's [18] and Royal Liverpool [19] in England were added to the rotation From 1892 the tournament was increased in duration to four 18-hole rounds over two days [17] (Prestwick had been extended to an 18-hole course by then [20]).\n\n\nAmerican success with Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones, and the last Open at Prestwick (1920–1939)\nIn 1920 the Open returned, and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club became the sole organiser of the Open Championship In 1926 they standardised the format of the tournament to spread over three days (18 holes on day 1 and 2, and 36 on day 3), and include both qualifying and a cut [21]\n\n\nBobby Locke, Peter Thomson, and Ben Hogan's Triple Crown (1946–1958)\nThe Open returned after the Second World War to St Andrews, with a victory for American Sam Snead Bobby Locke became the first South African winner, winning three times in four years between 1949 and 1952, and later winning a fourth title in 1957 Having already won the Masters and the U.S Open earlier in the year, Ben Hogan won in his one and only Open appearance in 1953 to win the \"Triple Crown\" [3] His achievement was so well regarded he returned to New York City to a ticker-tape parade [36] Peter Thomson became the first Australian winner, winning four times in five years between 1954 and 1958, and later winning a fifth title in 1965 [3] After flooding prevented Royal Cinque Ports from hosting, both in 1938 and 1949, it was removed from the rota [37] The Open was played outside of England and Scotland for the first time in 1951 at Royal Portrush, Northern Ireland [38]\n\n\nPlayer, Palmer, Nicklaus – The Big Three (1959–1974)\nIn 1959, Gary Player, a young South African, won the first of his three Opens Only four Americans had entered, but in 1960 Arnold Palmer travelled to Scotland after winning the Masters and U.S Open, in an attempt to emulate Hogan's 1953 feat of winning all three tournaments in a single year Although he finished second to Kel Nagle, he returned and won the Open in 1961 and 1962 Palmer was hugely popular in America, and his victories are likely to have been the first time many Americans would have seen the Open on television This, along with the growth of trans-Atlantic jet travel, inspired many more Americans to travel in the future [3]\n\n\nWatson, Ballesteros, Faldo, and Norman (1975–1993)\nBy 1975, the concept of the modern majors had been firmly established, and the PGA Championship had been moved to August since 1969, [40] so no longer clashed with the Open This meant the Open had a feel similar to the current tournament, with the leaders after 36 holes going off last (1957 onwards), [44] all players having to use the \"bigger ball\" (1974 onwards), [45] [46] [47] play spread over four days (1966 onwards, although the days were Wednesday to Saturday until 1980), [48] [49] and a field containing all the world's best players.\n\n\nTiger Woods and the modern era (1994 onwards)\nEvery year between 1994 and 2004 had a first-time winner [52] In 1999, the Open at Carnoustie was famously difficult, and Frenchman Jean van de Velde had a three-shot lead teeing off on the final hole He ended up triple bogeying after finding the Barry Burn, and Scotman Paul Lawrie, ranked 241st in the world, ended up winning in a playoff He was 10 strokes behind the leader going into the final round, a record for all majors [53] He was not the only unheralded champion during this span, as 396th-ranked Ben Curtis [54] and 56th-ranked Todd Hamilton [55] won in 2003 and 2004, respectively.\n\n\nTraditions\nThe Open is always played on a coastal links golf course Links golf is often described as the \"purest\" form of golf and keeps a connection with the way the game originated in Scotland in the 15th century The terrain is open, often without any trees, and will generally be undulating with a sandy base The golf courses are often primarily shaped by nature, rather than 'built' Weather, particularly wind, plays an important role, and although there will be a prevailing onshore breeze, changes in the wind direction and strength over the course of the tournament can mean each round of golf has to be played slightly differently The courses are also famous for deep pot bunkers, and gorse bushes that make up the \"rough\" A golfer playing on a links course will often adapt his game so the flight of the ball is lower and so is less impacted by the wind, but this will make distance control more difficult Also due to the windy conditions the speed of the greens are often slower than a golfer might be used to on the PGA Tour, to avoid the ball being moved by a gust [65] [66]\n\n\nLinks golf course\nThe Open is always played on a coastal links

avoid the ball being moved by a gust [65] [66]\n\n\nOld Course at St Andrews\nThe Old Course at St Andrews is regarded as the oldest golf course in the world, and winning the Open there is widely considered to be one of the pinnacles of achievement in golf [67] Given the special status of the Old Course, the Open is generally played there once every five years in the modern era, much more frequently than the other courses used for the Open [68]\n\n\nTrophy presentation\nThe Open trophy is the Claret Jug, which has been presented to the champion since 1873 (it was first awarded to Young Tom Morris in 1872, however the trophy was not ready in time—his name is the first to be engraved on it) [2] The original trophy permanently resides on display in the R&A's Clubhouse at St Andrews Therefore, the trophy that is presented at each Open is a replica which is retained by the winner for a year It used to be the responsibility of the winner to get his name engraved on the trophy, but 1967 winner Roberto De Vicenzo returned the trophy without having done so [70] Subsequently, the winner's name is already engraved on it when presented, which often results in television commentators speculating as to when it is safe for the engraver to start [71]\n\n\nName\nThe first event was held as an invitational tournament, but the next year Prestwick Golf Club declared that \"the belt.. on all future occasions, shall be open to all the world\" [75] In its early years it was often referred to as The Championship but with the advent of the Amateur Championship in 1885, it became more common to refer to it as The Open Championship or simply The Open The tournament inspired other national bodies to introduce open golf tournaments of their own, such as the U.S Open, and later many others [76] To distinguish it from their own national open, it became common in many countries to refer to the tournament as the \"British Open\" The R&A (the tournament's organiser) continued to refer to it as The Open Championship During the interwar years, a period with many U.S.-based winners, the term British Open would occasionally be used during the trophy presentation and in British newspapers [77] [78]\n\n\nStatus\nThe Open is recognised as one of the four major championships in golf, and is an official event on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour.\n\n\nStructure\nQualifying was introduced in 1907, and for much of its history, all players had to go through the qualification process In the modern era, the majority of players get an exemption from qualification which is awarded for previous performance in the Open, performance in high-profile global tournaments (such as other majors), performance in top golf tours, or a high position in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) Five amateurs are also exempt from qualifying by winning various global amateur titles provided they maintain their amateur status prior to The Open

fact that it is the most widely adopted currency for prize money in golf [102]\n\n\nChampion's prizes and benefits\nThe champion receives trophies, the winner's prize money, and several exemptions from world golf tours and tournaments He is also likely to receive a winner's bonus from his sponsors [103] The prizes and privileges on offer for the champion included:\n\n\nOther prizes and benefits, based upon finishing position\nThere are several benefits from being placed highly in the Open These are:\n\n\nAmateur medals\nSince 1949 the leading amateur completing the final round receives a silver medal Since 1972, any other amateur who competes in the final round receives a bronze medal [105] Amateurs do not receive prize money [116]\n\n\nProfessional Golfers' Association (of Great Britain and Ireland) awards\nThe Professional Golfers' Association (of Great Britain and Ireland) also mark the achievements of their own members in The Open.\n\n\nCourses\nThe Open Championship has always been held on a coastal links golf course in Scotland, England or Northern Ireland The hosting pattern has been: [68]\n\n\nOverview\nA total of 14 courses have hosted the Open, with ten

completes all 72 holes [105] In the earlier years wealthy individuals would often maintain their amateur status, and hence could win multiple times, such as Frank Stranahan who won it four times in the first five years (and was also the low amateur in 1947) In the modern era players often turn professional soon after winning the silver medal, and hence never have a chance for multiple wins Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only silver medal winners who have gone on to win the Open.\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe distribution of The Open is provided by a partnership between R&A Productions, European Tour Productions (both run by IMG) and CTV Outside Broadcasting The broadcasters with onsite production are Sky (UK), NBC (USA), BBC (UK), and TV Asahi (Japan) [169]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe BBC first started to broadcast the Open in 1955, [174] with Peter Alliss involved since 1961, and having the role of lead commentator since 1978 [175] With the growth of pay television, and the increasing value of sporting rights, the BBC's golf portfolio began to reduce The loss of the rights to the Scottish Open, and BMW PGA Championship in 2012 left the BBC's only golf coverage as the Open, and the final two days of the Masters (which it shared with Sky) With so little golf, the BBC was accused of neglecting investment in production and was criticised about its 'quality of coverage and innovation' compared to Sky, which held the rights to most golf events The tournament is considered a Category B event under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events, which allows its rights to be held by a pay television broadcaster as long as sufficient secondary coverage is provided by a free-to-air broadcaster [176] [174] [177]\n\n\nTimeline of U.K. broadcasting rights\nRef: [174] [182] [183] [184]\n\n\nUnited States\nABC began broadcasting the Open in 1962, with taped highlights on Wide World of Sports [185] In the pre-digital age the coverage had to be converted from the U.K.'s PAL colour encoding system, to the U.S.'s NTSC, which meant picture quality could be impacted, especially in the early years [186] The coverage expanded over the years, and as is common in America, there was a different early round rights holder, which was ESPN until 2003 when TNT took over Co-owned ESPN became responsible for ABC's sports coverage in 2006; it won the rights to cover all four days of the championship in 2010, and concurrently moved coverage to its channels The Open became the first golf major to be covered exclusively on pay television in America, as ESPN left only highlights for its partner broadcast network.\n\n\nTimeline of U.S. broadcasting rights\nRef: [188]\n\n\nTheOpen.com\nThe Open provides limited coverage for free on its website including highlights, featured groups, featured holes, and radio coverage The Open's local rights holders usually provide these feeds as part of their broadcast package [191]\n\n\nRest of the world\nThe Open produces a 'world feed' for use by international broadcasters if they require [169] The other large golf markets in a similar time zone as the U.K are the rest of Europe (where Sky, the U.K broadcast company often has a presence), and South Africa where it is covered by SuperSport [192]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article":

It is one of the four major championships in golf and is an official event on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first Open Championship was played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. The tournament was founded by James Ogilvie Fairlie, a member of Prestwick Golf Club, who wanted to create a competition for professional golfers. The first champion was Willie Park Sr., who defeated Tom Morris Sr. by one stroke.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, golf was played mainly by well-off gentlemen, as hand-crafted clubs and balls were expensive.

The Claret Jug was first awarded in 1872, and has been presented to the champion ever since.\n\n**The Introduction of Course Rotation and the Claret Jug (1872-1889)**\n\nOn 11 September 1872, agreement was reached between Prestwick, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club to introduce course rotation and the Claret Jug. Each of the three clubs would contribute £10 towards the cost of a new silver trophy, which became known as the Claret Jug. The hosting of the Open would be rotated between the three clubs.\n\nThis decision was taken too late for the trophy to be presented to the 1872 Open champion, Young Tom Morris. Instead, he was awarded with a medal inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', although he is the first to be engraved on the Claret Jug as the 1872 winner.\n\n**English Hosts and Winners, and the Great Triumvirate (1890-1914)**\n\nIn the 1890s, the tournament was won four times by three Englishmen (two of whom were amateurs). In 1892, the tournament was played for the first time at the newly built Muirfield, which replaced Musselburgh as the host venue used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers.\n\nA few years later, St George's and Royal Liverpool in England were added to the rotation. From 1892, the tournament was increased in duration to four 18-hole rounds over two days. Prestwick had been extended to an 18-hole course by then.\n\n**American Success with Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones, and the Last Open at Prestwick (1920-1939)**\n\nIn 1920, the Open returned, and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club became the sole organiser of the Open Championship. In 1926, they standardised the format of the tournament to spread over three days (18 holes on day 1 and 2, and 36 on day 3), and include both qualifying and a cut.\n\nThe 1920s and 1930s saw American success at the Open, with Walter Hagen winning three times and Bobby Jones winning twice. The last Open at Prestwick was played in 1939.\n\n**Bobby Locke, Peter Thomson, and Ben Hogan's Triple Crown (1946-1958)**\n\nThe Open returned after the Second World War to St Andrews, with a victory for American Sam Snead. Bobby Locke became the first South African winner, winning three times in four years between 1949 and 1952, and later winning a fourth title in 1957.\n\nHaving already won the Masters and the U.S Open earlier in the year, Ben Hogan won in his one and only Open appearance in 1953 to win the \"Triple Crown\". His achievement was so well regarded he returned to New York City to a ticker-tape parade.\n\nPeter Thomson became the first Australian winner, winning four times in five years between 1954 and 1958, and later winning a fifth title in 1965.\n\n**Player, Palmer, Nicklaus – The Big Three (1959-1974)**\n\nIn 1959, Gary Player, a young South African, won the first of his three Open titles. Only four Americans had entered, but in 1960, Arnold Palmer travelled to Scotland after winning the Masters and U.S Open, in an attempt to emulate Hogan's 1953 feat of winning all three tournaments in a single year.\n\nAlthough he finished second to Kel Nagle, he returned and won the Open in 1961 and 1962. Palmer was hugely popular in America, and his victories are likely to have been the first time many Americans would have seen the Open on television.\n\nThis, along with the growth of trans-Atlantic jet travel, inspired many more Americans to travel in the future.\n\n**Watson, Ballesteros, Faldo, and Norman (1975-1993)**\n\nBy 1975, the concept of the modern majors had been firmly established, and the PGA Championship had been moved to August since 1969, so no longer clashed with the Open. This meant the Open had a feel similar to the current tournament, with the leaders after 36 holes going off last (1957 onwards), all players having to use the \"bigger ball\" (1974 onwards), play spread over four days (1966 onwards, although the days were Wednesday to Saturday until 1980), and a field containing all the world's best players.\n\n**Tiger Woods and the Modern Era (1994 onwards)**\n\nEvery year between 1994 and 2004 had a first-time winner. In 1999, the Open at Carnoustie was famously difficult, and Frenchman Jean van de Velde had a three-shot lead teeing off on the final hole. He ended up triple bogeying after finding the Barry Burn, and Scotman Paul Lawrie, ranked 241st in the world, ended up winning in a playoff.\n\nHe was 10 strokes behind the leader going into the final round, a record for all majors. He was not the only unheralded champion during this span, as 396th-ranked Ben Curtis won in 2003, and 56th-ranked Todd Hamilton won in 2004.\n\n**Traditions**\n\nThe Open is always played on a coastal links golf course. Links golf is often described as the \"purest\" form of golf and keeps a connection with the way the game originated in Scotland in the 15th century. The terrain is open, often without any trees, and will generally be undulating with a sandy base.\n\nThe golf courses are often primarily shaped by nature, rather than 'built'. Weather, particularly wind, plays an important role, and although there will be a prevailing onshore breeze, changes in the wind direction and strength over the course of the tournament can mean each round of golf has to be played slightly differently.\n\nThe courses are also famous for deep pot bunkers, and gorse bushes that make up the \"rough\". A golfer playing on a links course will often adapt his game so the flight of the ball is lower and so is less impacted by the wind, but this will make distance control more difficult.\n\nAlso due to the windy conditions the speed of the greens are often slower than a golfer might be used to on the PGA Tour, to avoid the ball being moved by a gust.\n\n**Old Course at St Andrews**\n\nThe Old Course at St Andrews is regarded as the oldest golf course in the world, and winning the Open there is widely considered to be one of the pinnacles of achievement in golf. Given the special status of the Old Course, the Open is generally played there once every five years in the modern era, much more frequently than the other courses used for the Open.\n\n**Trophy Presentation**\n\nThe Open trophy is the Claret Jug, which has been presented to the champion since 1873. The original trophy permanently resides on display in the R&A's Clubhouse at St Andrews. Therefore, the trophy that is presented at each Open is a replica which is retained by the winner for a year.\n\n**Name**\n\nThe first event was held as an invitational tournament, but the next year Prestwick Golf Club declared that \"the belt.. on all future occasions, shall be open to all the world\". In its early years it was often referred to as The Championship but with the advent of the Amateur Championship in 1885, it became more common to refer to it as The Open Championship or simply The Open.\n\nThe tournament inspired other national bodies to introduce open golf tournaments of their own, such as the U.S Open, and later many others. To distinguish it from their own national open, it became common in many countries to refer to the tournament as the \"British Open\". The R&A (the tournament's organiser) continued to refer to it as The Open Championship.\n\n**Status**\n\nThe Open is recognised as one of the four major championships in golf, and is an official event on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour.\n\n**Structure**\n\nQualifying was introduced in 1907, and for much of its history, all players had to go through the qualification process. In the modern era, the majority of players get an exemption from qualification which is awarded for previous performance in the Open, performance in high-profile global tournaments (such as other majors), performance in top golf tours, or a high position in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR).\n\nFive amateurs are also exempt from qualifying by winning various global amateur titles provided they maintain their amateur status prior to The Open.\n\n**Field**\n\n156 players compete in the Open Championship.\n\n**Prizes**\n\nUp until 2016, the purse was always stated, and paid, in pounds sterling (£), but was changed in 2017 to US dollars ($) in recognition of the fact that it is the most widely adopted currency for prize money in golf.\n\n**Champion's Prizes and Benefits**\n\nThe champion receives trophies, the winner's prize money, and several exemptions from world golf tours and tournaments. He is also likely to receive a winner's bonus from his sponsors.\n\n**Other Prizes and Benefits, based upon Finishing Position**\n\nThere are several benefits from being placed highly in the Open. These include:\n\n* Amateurs do not receive prize money.\n* A total of 14 courses have hosted the Open, with ten currently active as part of the rotation, and four have been retired from the rotation (shown in italics). The year the golf course was originally built is shown in parentheses.\n\n**Hosts of The Open**\n\nReferences:\n\n* The 148th Open 2019 Media Guide\n\n**Winners**\n\nNationalities assigned above match those used in the official Open records.\n\nSource:\n\n* The 148th Open 2019 Media Guide\n\n**Silver Medal Winners**\n\nSince 1949, the silver medal is awarded to the leading amateur, provided that the player completes all 72 holes. In the earlier years wealthy individuals would often maintain their amateur status, and hence could win multiple times, such as Frank Stranahan who won it four times in the first five years (and was also the low amateur in 1947). In the modern era players often turn professional soon after winning the silver medal, and hence never have a chance for multiple wins. Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only silver medal winners who have gone on to win the Open.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nThe distribution of The Open is provided by a partnership between R&A Productions, European Tour Productions (both run by IMG) and CTV Outside Broadcasting. The broadcasters with onsite production are Sky (UK), NBC (USA), BBC (UK), and TV Asahi (Japan).\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nThe BBC first started to broadcast the Open in 1955, with Peter Alliss involved since 1961, and having the role of lead commentator since 1978. With the growth of pay television, and the increasing value of sporting rights, the BBC's golf portfolio began to reduce. The loss of the rights to the Scottish Open, and BMW PGA Championship in 2012 left the BBC's only golf coverage as the Open, and the final two days of the Masters (which it shared with Sky). With so little golf, the BBC was accused of neglecting investment in production and was criticised about its 'quality of coverage and innovation' compared to Sky, which held the rights to most golf events.\n\nThe tournament is considered a Category B event under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events, which allows its rights to be held by a pay television broadcaster as long as sufficient secondary coverage is provided by a free-to-air broadcaster.\n\n**Timeline of U.K. Broadcasting Rights**\n\nRef:\n\n* BBC Sport: The Open Championship\n* Sky Sports: The Open Championship\n\n**United States**\n\nABC began broadcasting the Open in 1962, with taped highlights on Wide World of Sports. In the pre-digital age the coverage had to be converted from the U.K.'s PAL colour encoding system, to the U.S.'s NTSC, which meant picture quality could be impacted, especially in the early years. The coverage expanded over the years, and as is common in America, there was a different early round rights holder, which was ESPN until 2003 when TNT took over. Co-owned ESPN became responsible for ABC's sports coverage in 2006; it won the rights to cover all four days of the championship in 2010, and concurrently moved coverage to its channels.\n\nThe Open became the first golf major to be covered exclusively on pay television in America, as ESPN left only highlights for its partner broadcast network.\n\n**Timeline of U.S. Broadcasting Rights**\n\nRef:\n\n* ESPN: The Open Championship\n* NBC Sports: The Open Championship\n\n**TheOpen.com**\n\nThe Open provides limited coverage for free on its website, including highlights, featured groups, featured holes, and radio coverage. The Open's local rights holders usually provide these feeds as part of their broadcast package.\n\n**Rest of the World**\n\nThe Open produces a 'world feed' for use by international broadcasters if they require. The other large golf markets in a similar time zone as the U.K are the rest of Europe (where Sky, the U.K broadcast company often has a presence), and South Africa where it is covered by SuperSport.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of The Open Championship winners\n* List of The Open Championship courses\n* The Open Championship records\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The R&A rights holders agreements

century golf was played mainly by well-off gentlemen, as hand-crafted clubs and balls were expensive Professionals made a living from playing for bets, caddying, ball and club making, and instruction Allan Robertson was the most famous of these pros, and was regarded as the undisputed best golfer between 1843 and his death in 1859 [4] [3] James Ogilvie Fairlie of Prestwick Golf Club decided to form a competition in 1860, \"to be played for by professional golfers\", [5] and to decide who would succeed Robertson as the \"Champion Golfer\" Blackheath (England), Perth, Bruntsfield (Edinburgh), Musselburgh and St Andrews golf clubs were invited to send up to three of their best players known as a \"respectable caddie\" to represent each of the clubs [6] The winner received the Challenge Belt, made from red leather with a silver buckle and worth £25, which came about thanks to being donated by the Earl of Eglinton, a man with a keen interest in medieval pageantry (belts were the type of trophy that might have been competed for in archery or jousting) [7] [6]\n\n\nEarly tournament years (1860–1870)\nThe first Open Championship was played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in

course rotation and the Claret Jug (1872–1889)\nOn 11 September 1872 agreement was reached between Prestwick, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club They decided that each of the three clubs would contribute £10 towards the cost of a new silver trophy, which became known as the Claret Jug, known officially as The Golf Champion Trophy, and hosting of the Open would be rotated between the three clubs These decisions were taken too late for the trophy to be presented to the 1872 Open champion, who was once again Young Tom Morris Instead, he was awarded with a medal inscribed 'The Golf Champion Trophy', although he is the first to be engraved on the Claret Jug as the 1872 winner Medals have been given to, and kept by the winner ever since [8] Young Tom Morris died in 1875, aged 24 [14]\n\n\nEnglish hosts and winners, and the Great Triumvirate (1890–1914)\nIn the 1890s, the tournament was won four times by three Englishman (two of whom were amateurs) [16] In 1892 the tournament was played for the first time at the newly built Muirfield, which replaced Musselburgh as the host venue used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers [17]

Royal Cinque Ports from hosting, both in 1938 and 1949, it was removed from the rota [37] The Open was played outside of England and Scotland for the first time in 1951 at Royal Portrush, Northern Ireland [38]\n\n\nPlayer, Palmer, Nicklaus – The Big Three (1959–1974)\nIn 1959, Gary Player, a young South African, won the first of his three Opens Only four Americans had entered, but in 1960

Her work focused on the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue, and she is credited with isolating and characterizing the progesterone receptor gene in mice.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nShyamala was born on December 7, 1938, in Madras, Madras Province, British India (present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India) to P V Gopalan, a civil servant, and Rajam, her mother. Her parents were from two villages near the town of Mannargudi in Madras Province. Gopalan had begun his professional life as a stenographer and, as he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Secretariat Service and later Central Secretariat Service, he moved the family every few years between Madras (now Chennai), New Delhi, Bombay (now Mumbai), and Calcutta (now Kolkata). He and Rajam had an arranged marriage, but according to Shyamala's brother, Balachandran, their parents were broad-minded in raising the children, all of whom led somewhat unconventional lives. A gifted singer of Carnatic music, Shyamala won a national competition in it as a teenager.\n\nGrowing up in a family that frequently moved, Shyamala developed a strong sense of adaptability and independence. Her parents encouraged her to pursue her interests and passions, which included music, science, and social justice. These formative experiences would shape her future career and personal life.\n\n**Career**\n\nShyamala conducted research in UC Berkeley's Department of Physiology and Cancer Research Lab. She worked as a breast cancer researcher at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and University of Wisconsin. For 16 years, she worked at Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and McGill University Faculty of Medicine. She served as a peer reviewer for the National Institutes of Health and as a site visit team member for the Federal Advisory Committee. Additionally, she served on the President's Special Commission on Breast Cancer. Shyamala mentored dozens of students in her lab, and her dedication to teaching and mentoring earned her a reputation as a respected and inspiring academic.\n\nFor her last decade of research, Shyamala worked in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Her research focused on the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue, and she made significant contributions to the field of breast cancer research. Her work on the isolation and characterization of the progesterone receptor gene in mice changed the understanding of breast cancer biology.\n\n**Research**\n\nShyamala's research led to advancements in the knowledge of hormones pertaining to breast cancer. Her work on the progesterone receptor gene in mice demonstrated that this gene was responsible for the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue. This discovery had significant implications for the development of breast cancer treatments.\n\nShyamala's research also explored the role of hormones in breast cancer development and progression. She investigated the effects of estrogen and progesterone on breast tissue and identified potential targets for breast cancer therapy. Her work laid the foundation for future research in this area and contributed to the development of new treatments for breast cancer.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn the fall of 1962, Shyamala met a graduate student in economics from Jamaica, Donald J Harris, at a meeting of the Afro-American Association—a students' group at Berkeley whose members would go on to give structure to the discipline of Black studies, propose the holiday of Kwanzaa, and help establish the Black Panther Party. According to Donald Harris, who is now an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University, \"We talked then, continued to talk at a subsequent meeting, and at another, and another.\" In 1963, they were married without following the convention of introducing Harris to Shyamala's parents beforehand or having the ceremony in her hometown.\n\nIn the later 1960s, Donald and Shyamala took their daughters, Kamala, then four or five years old, and Maya, two years younger, to newly independent Zambia, where Shyamala's father, P V Gopalan, was on an advisory assignment. After Shyamala and Donald divorced in the early 1970s, she took her daughters to India several times to visit her parents in Chennai, where they had retired.\n\n**Death**\n\nShyamala died of colon cancer in Oakland on February 11, 2009, at age 70. She requested that donations be made to the organization Breast Cancer Action. Later in 2009, Kamala Harris carried her mother's ashes to Chennai on the southeastern coast of peninsular India and dispersed them in the Indian Ocean waters.\n\nShyamala's legacy is a testament to her dedication to research, teaching, and social justice. Her contributions to the field of breast cancer research have improved our understanding of the disease and paved the way for new treatments. Her commitment to mentoring and inspiring the next generation of scientists and researchers continues to inspire and motivate individuals around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shyamala_Gopalan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nShyamala was born on December 7, 1938, in Madras, Madras Province, British India (present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India) to P V Gopalan, a civil servant, and Rajam, her mother Her parents were from two villages near the town of Mannargudi in Madras Province [8] Gopalan had begun his professional life as a stenographer, [9] and, as he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Secretariat Service and later Central Secretariat Service, [10] he moved the family every few years between Madras (now Chennai), New Delhi, Bombay (now Mumbai), and Calcutta (now Kolkata) [9] [8] He and Rajam had an arranged marriage, but according to Shyamala's brother, Balachandran, their parents were broad-minded in raising the children, all of whom led somewhat unconventional lives [8] A gifted singer of Carnatic music, Shyamala won a national competition in it as a teenager [8]\n\n\nCareer\nShyamala conducted research in UC Berkeley's Department of Physiology and Cancer Research Lab She worked as a breast cancer researcher at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and University of Wisconsin She worked for 16 years at Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and McGill University Faculty of Medicine She served as a peer reviewer for the National Institutes of Health and as a site visit team member for the Federal Advisory Committee She also served on the President's Special Commission on Breast Cancer She mentored dozens of students in her lab For her last decade of research, Shyamala worked in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [12]\n\n\nResearch\nShyamala's research led to advancements in the knowledge of hormones pertaining to breast cancer [13] [6] Her work in the isolation and characterization of the progesterone receptor gene in mice changed research on the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue [6]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn the fall of 1962, at a meeting of the Afro-American Association—a students' group at Berkeley whose members would go on to give structure to the discipline of Black studies, propose the holiday of Kwanzaa, and help establish the Black Panther Party—Shyamala met a graduate student in economics from Jamaica, Donald J Harris, who was that day's speaker [14] According to Donald Harris, who is now an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University, \"We talked then, continued to talk at a subsequent meeting, and at another, and another.\" [14] In 1963, they were married without following the convention of introducing Harris to Shyamala's parents beforehand or having the ceremony in her hometown [8] In the later 1960s, Donald and Shyamala took their daughters, Kamala, then four or five years old, and Maya, two years younger, to newly independent Zambia, where Shyamala's father, P V Gopalan, was on an advisory assignment [8] After Shyamala and Donald divorced in the early 1970s, she took her daughters to India several times to visit her parents in Chennai, where they had retired [8] [15]\n\n\nDeath\nShyamala died of colon cancer in Oakland on February 11, 2009, at age 70 [6] She requested that donations be made to the organization Breast Cancer Action [6] Later in 2009, Kamala Harris carried her mother's ashes to Chennai on the southeastern coast of peninsular India and dispersed them in the Indian Ocean waters [18]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSelected publications\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album was a departure from her previous work, with a more mature and experimental sound. Milian worked with producers such as Scott Storch and The Neptunes on the album. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 14 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Milian released several successful singles from the album, including \"Dip It Low\" and \"Whatever U Want.\"\n\n**2005–2006: So Amazin'**\n\nMilian's third studio album, So Amazin', was released in 2006. The album was a hip-hop soul and R&B record, with a more experimental sound than her previous work. Milian worked with producers such as Cool & Dre and The-Dream on the album. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Milian released several successful singles from the album, including \"Say I\" and \"Love You Anyway.\"\n\n**2007–2010: Elope**\n\nMilian signed with MySpace Records in 2008. She began working on her fourth studio album, Elope, which was released in 2009. The album was a hip-hop soul and R&B record, with a more experimental sound than her previous work. Milian worked with producers such as The-Dream and Tricky Stewart on the album. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 9 on the US Billboard 200 chart. Milian released several successful singles from the album, including \"Us Against the World\" and \"Who's Gonna Ride.\"\n\n**2010–2014: Return to Music, The Voice and Dancing with the Stars**\n\nMilian was scheduled to resume recording in July 2010 to complete the album; however, Milian opted to focus on her acting career. Despite the separation, Milian and The-Dream continued to \"work together and write together.\" At the 2010 Los Angeles Fashion Week, Milian performed \"Zipper\" and \"Dip It Low.\" Milian has worked on a fourth studio album since 2008, but its release has frequently been delayed. At the 2010 American Music Awards, she said it would be ready in 2011. In June 2011, her collaboration with The Jackie Boyz titled \"Memory\" was released in Japan. It was set to appear on their album Songs In My Blackberry.\n\n**2015–present: \"#TinaTurnUp, New Ventures, and a Music Refocus**\n\nOn January 18, 2015, Milian debuted her reality show, Christina Milian Turned Up. The series follows the day-to-day lives of Christina, her mother Carmen and her two sisters, Danielle and Liz Flores. It was renewed for a second season in April, which premiered in November 2015. In March, she released a pair of singles (which were previewed in her reality series), with \"Rebel\" and \"We Ain't Worried,\" of which the latter was used to promote her \"We Are Pop Culture\" clothing line. In July, she announced she was going to release a 5-track EP and video set, and was working with director Mike Ho. Also that month, she performed the National Anthem at the 2015 Americafest and premiered a new single \"Like Me\" featuring Snoop Dogg. A few months later, she released another single \"Do It\" with Lil' Wayne and changed the EP's title to Like Me. Her EP \"4U\" was released on December 4, 2015, which includes four tracks and music videos packaged in one.\n\n**Entrepreneurship**\n\nMilian co-owns Viva Diva Wines with her mother and manager Carmen Milian, as well as her publicist Robyn Santiago.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMilian has been faced with the challenges of being an Afro-Latina, stating, \"Growing up, I didn't know where I fit in... I didn't know what I was.\" Milian has spoken about the importance of embracing her heritage and being proud of her roots.\n\n**Relationships and Children**\n\nMilian met actor Nick Cannon on the set of their film, Love Don't Cost a Thing, in 2003, and they began dating. After being together for two and a half years, Milian ended her relationship with Cannon in 2005 because of his cheating. Cannon revealed that he refused to stay faithful to Milian because their relationship was becoming too much like a \"Christian romance.\" When Cannon married Mariah Carey on April 30, 2008, Milian said, \"regardless of what I felt in the past at the time, I actually forgive him and I'm very much over that.\"\n\n**Artistry**\n\nMilian possesses a soprano vocal range. Her vocal style has been compared to Paula Abdul and Aaliyah by critics. David Peisner of Maxim commented on her talent and described her voice as being \"silky and sassy.\" Earlier in her career, Milian was mainly an urban pop and teen pop singer, but as she matured and grew her sound, she later grew to branch out into a more hip-hop soul and straight-forward R&B sound on her later two releases, It's About Time and So Amazin'.\n\n**Other Ventures**\n\nIn 2010, Milian signed Australian singers, Kasey Osborne and Kelsey-Maree, as their manager. Milian said, \"the girls have everything it takes to be the biggest international duo out there. The world is definitely ready for these beautiful girls to hit the stage and kill it on screen.\" She said that the duo were the \"most exciting project\" she had worked on.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* Christina Milian (2001)\n* It's About Time (2004)\n* So Amazin' (2006)\n* Elope (2009)\n* 4U (2015)\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* American Pie 2 (2001)\n* Love Don't Cost a Thing (2003)\n* Be Cool (2005)\n* The Forger (2005)\n* Unstable Fables: Goldilocks and the Three Bears (2008)\n* Punk'd (2003-2004)\n* The Voice (2012-2013)\n* Dancing with the Stars (2016)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Teen Choice Awards\n* MTV Video Music Awards\n* Billboard Music Awards\n* Soul Train Music Awards\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Christina Milian - Biography\".

{"title": "Bell_P-63_Kingcobra", "content": "\nDesign and development\nWhile the P-39 had been introduced as an interceptor, later in its development it was decided to reduce the cost and complexity of the engine by removing the turbocharger High-altitude performance suffered dramatically as a result, and Bell proposed an experimental series to test out a variety of solutions.\n\n\nXP-39E\nWhile the P-39 had been introduced as an interceptor, later in its development it was decided to reduce the cost and complexity of the engine by removing the turbocharger High-altitude performance suffered dramatically as a result, and Bell proposed an experimental series to test out a variety of solutions.\n\n\nXP-63\nAlthough the XP-39E proved disappointing, the USAAF was nevertheless interested in an even larger aircraft based on the same basic layout Even before its first flight, the USAAF placed an order on 27 June 1941 for two prototypes of an enlarged version powered by the same V-1710-47 The new design was given the designation XP-63 and serials were 41-19511 and 41-19512 A third prototype was also ordered, 42-78015, using the Packard V-1650, the U.S.-built version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.\n\n\nSwept-wing L-39\nAfter the war, two war surplus P-63Cs were modified by Bell under Navy contract for flight testing of low-speed and stall characteristics of high-speed wing designs The aircraft received new wings with adjustable leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps and a pronounced sweep of 35 degrees The wings had no wheel wells; only the nose gear was retractable [7] L-39-1 first flew 23 April 1946, demonstrating a need for extra tail surface and rear fuselage length to balance the aircraft in flight—the wing repositioning reduced empennage effectiveness and moved the center of lift aft A lighter three-bladed propeller from a P-39Q-10 was mounted and the necessary changes to the empennage were made L-39-2 incorporated these adjustments from the start L-39-1 later went to NACA at Langley for wind tunnel testing, where much valuable data was gathered [8] L-39-2 also served as a testbed for the Bell X-2 40-degree wing design [9]\n\n\nOperational service\nThe first version to be supplied in quantity to the Soviet Union was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage The fuselage proved to need strengthening; consequently, in October 1944 a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed [10]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe first version to be supplied in quantity to the Soviet Union was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage The fuselage proved to need strengthening; consequently, in October 1944 a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed [10]\n\n\nFrance\nIn 1945, 114 later models were delivered to the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air), but they arrived too late to see service in World War II They did see service during the First Indochina War before being replaced in 1951.\n\n\n\"Pinball\" operations\nIts main use in American service was the unusual one of a manned flying target for gunnery practice [21] The aircraft was generally painted bright orange to increase its visibility All armament and the regular armor was removed from these RP-63 aircraft, and over a ton of armored sheet metal was applied to the aircraft This was fitted with sensors that would detect hits, and these hits were signaled by illuminating a light in the propeller hub where the cannon would have been This earned the aircraft the unofficial nickname of Pinball [21] Special frangible rounds made of a lead/Bakelite combination were developed that would disintegrate upon impact [21] These were known as the \"Cartridge, Caliber .30, Frangible, Ball, M22\" In 1990, veteran Pinball pilot, Ivan L Hickman, wrote Operation Pinball about the training flights [22]\n\n\nRAE Testing\nBritish engineers, like the Americans, had a growing interest during World War II in the application of laminar flow airfoils In an effort to learn more about the practical application of laminar flow airfoils, in 1945 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) undertook a flight test program with one of the two P-63As that the United Kingdom had received [23] [page needed] The aircraft was equipped with a wake rake array mounted outboard, behind the wing, to allow the momentum deficit, and thus section drag, to be measured.\n\n\nPostwar air racers\nNumerous surplus P-63s ended up on the air racing circuit in the immediate postwar era Charles Tucker purchased two P-63s from the disposal facility at Kingman, Arizona just after the war He entered one of them, the Tucker Special as Race 28 with the name Flying Red Horse emblazoned on the nose (civilian register N62995) in the 1946 Thompson Trophy race He had clipped the wings by 12 ft 9 in (3.89 m) in an attempt to improve its speed, reducing the span to 25 ft 9 in (7.85 m) The second one (44-4126 (XN63231 Race 30)) was intended for the 1946 Bendix cross country race It was initially fitted with two wingtip drop tanks In 1947, the drop tanks were removed and the wings were clipped to 28 ft 6 in (8.69 m).\n\n\nVariants\nOn 3 June 2001, a Bell P-63A crashed during the Biggin Hill International Air Fair in London, England, killing the pilot The pilot was at the top of a vertical

"lang": "en", "article": "**Bell P-63 Kingcobra**\n\nThe Bell P-63 Kingcobra was an American single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft used by the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. It was designed by Bell Aircraft and was the final development of the P-39 Airacobra series.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was a response to the need for a high-performance fighter aircraft that could operate at high altitudes and speeds. The aircraft was designed to be a more efficient and powerful version of the P-39 Airacobra, with a more streamlined fuselage and a more powerful engine. The P-63 was also designed to be a more maneuverable and versatile aircraft, with a wider range of capabilities and a greater degree of flexibility.\n\n**Design and Development**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was developed from the P-39 Airacobra, which had been introduced in 1941. The P-39 had been designed as an interceptor, but it had proven to be inadequate for the task due to its lack of power and maneuverability. The P-63 was designed to address these limitations and to provide a more capable and versatile fighter aircraft.\n\nThe P-63 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine, which produced 1,600 horsepower. The aircraft had a wingspan of 36 feet and a length of 36 feet, and it weighed around 7,000 pounds. The P-63 was armed with four 0.50-inch machine guns and two 0.30-inch machine guns.\n\n**XP-63**\n\nThe XP-63 was the first prototype of the P-63 Kingcobra, and it was developed in 1941. The XP-63 was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine and had a wingspan of 36 feet and a length of 36 feet. The aircraft weighed around 7,000 pounds and was armed with four 0.50-inch machine guns and two 0.30-inch machine guns.\n\nThe XP-63 was tested extensively by the USAAF, and it proved to be a highly maneuverable and versatile aircraft. The aircraft was capable of speeds of over 400 mph and had a rate of climb of over 3,000 feet per minute. The XP-63 was also highly stable and had a low stall speed, making it an ideal training aircraft.\n\n**Swept-wing L-39**\n\nAfter the war, two war surplus P-63Cs were modified by Bell under Navy contract for flight testing of low-speed and stall characteristics of high-speed wing designs. The aircraft received new wings with adjustable leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps and a pronounced sweep of 35 degrees. The wings had no wheel wells; only the nose gear was retractable.

A lighter three-bladed propeller from a P-39Q-10 was mounted and the necessary changes to the empennage were made. L-39-2 incorporated these adjustments from the start. L-39-1 later went to NACA at Langley for wind tunnel testing, where much valuable data was gathered.\n\n**Operational Service**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was used by the USAAF during World War II, primarily for escort and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft was also used by the Soviet Union and the French Air Force after the war.\n\nThe P-63 was a highly effective aircraft, with a top speed of over 400 mph and a rate of climb of over 3,000 feet per minute. The aircraft was also highly stable and had a low stall speed, making it an ideal training aircraft.\n\n**Soviet Union**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was supplied to the Soviet Union in large quantities, and it was used extensively by the Soviet Air Force during World War II. The aircraft was used for escort and reconnaissance missions, and it was also used for ground attack missions.\n\nThe P-63 was a highly effective aircraft in Soviet service, and it was used by many top Soviet aces, including Ivan Kozhedub and Mikhail Gorbunov.\n\n**France**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was supplied to the French Air Force in 1945, after the end of World War II. The aircraft was used for reconnaissance and escort missions, and it was also used for ground attack missions.\n\nThe P-63 was a highly effective aircraft in French service, and it was used by many French aces, including Pierre Clostermann and André Turcat.\n\n**\"Pinball\" Operations**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was also used for a unique mission, known as \"Pinball\" operations. The aircraft was painted bright orange to increase its visibility, and it was used as a manned flying target for gunnery practice. The aircraft was armed with sensors that would detect hits, and these hits were signaled by illuminating a light in the propeller hub where the cannon would have been.

He entered one of them, the Tucker Special as Race 28 with the name \"Flying Red Horse\" emblazoned on the nose (civilian register N62995) in the 1946 Thompson Trophy race. The second one (44-4126 (XN63231 Race 30)) was intended for the 1946 Bendix cross country race. It was initially fitted with two wingtip drop tanks. In 1947, the drop tanks were removed and the wings were clipped to 28 feet 6 inches.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was manufactured in several variants, including the P-63A, P-63B, and P-63C. The P-63A was the most common variant, and it was used extensively by the USAAF during World War II. The P-63B was a variant that was used by the Soviet Union, and it had a number of modifications, including a different engine and a different armament. The P-63C was a variant that was used for training and was equipped with a number of modifications, including a different engine and a different armament.\n\n**Specifications (P-63A)**\n\n* Length: 36 feet 3 inches\n* Wingspan: 36 feet 1 inch\n* Height: 9 feet 10 inches\n* Empty weight: 7,000 pounds\n* Gross weight: 9,500 pounds\n* Powerplant: Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine\n* Maximum speed: 420 mph\n* Rate of climb: 3,000 feet per minute\n* Service ceiling: 35,000 feet\n* Range: 400 miles\n* Armament: 4 x 0.50-inch machine guns, 2 x 0.30-inch machine guns\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was used by several countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The aircraft was used extensively by the USAAF during World War II, and it was also used by the Soviet Air Force and the French Air Force.\n\n**Accidents and Incidents**\n\nThe P-63 Kingcobra was involved in several accidents and incidents during its service life. In 1946, a P-63 crashed during a training mission, killing the pilot. In 1947, a P-63 crashed during a air show, killing both pilots. In 1948, a P-63 crashed during a test flight, killing the pilot.\n\n**Survivors**\n\nSeveral P-63 Kingcobras have survived to the present day and are on display in museums and private collections. The aircraft is highly prized by collectors and historians due to its unique design and its role in World War II.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \"The Bell P-63 Kingcobra.\" Aviation History, vol. 14, no.

outline:\n\n\nDesign and development\nWhile the P-39 had been introduced as an interceptor, later in its development it was decided to reduce the cost and complexity of the engine by removing the turbocharger High-altitude performance suffered dramatically as a result, and Bell proposed an experimental series to test out a variety of solutions.\n\n\nXP-39E\nWhile the P-39 had been introduced as an interceptor, later in its development it was decided to reduce the cost and complexity of the engine by removing the turbocharger High-altitude performance suffered dramatically as a result, and Bell proposed an experimental series to test out a variety of solutions.\n\n\nXP-63\nAlthough the XP-39E proved disappointing, the USAAF was nevertheless interested in an even larger aircraft based on the same basic layout Even before its first flight, the USAAF placed an order on 27 June 1941 for two prototypes of an enlarged version powered by the same V-1710-47 The new design was given the designation XP-63 and serials were 41-19511 and 41-19512 A third prototype was also ordered, 42-78015, using the Packard V-1650, the U.S.-built version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine.\n\n\nSwept-wing L-39\nAfter the war, two war surplus P-63Cs were modified by Bell under Navy contract for flight testing of low-speed and stall characteristics of high-speed wing designs The aircraft received new wings with adjustable leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps and a pronounced sweep of 35 degrees The wings had no wheel wells; only the nose gear was retractable [7] L-39-1 first flew 23 April 1946, demonstrating a need for extra tail surface and rear fuselage length to balance the aircraft in flight—the wing repositioning reduced empennage effectiveness and moved the center of lift aft A lighter three-bladed propeller from a P-39Q-10 was mounted and the necessary changes to the empennage were made L-39-2 incorporated these adjustments from the start L-39-1 later went to NACA at Langley for wind tunnel testing, where much valuable data was gathered [8] L-39-2 also served as a testbed for the Bell X-2 40-degree wing design [9]\n\n\nOperational service\nThe first version to be supplied in quantity to the Soviet Union was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage The fuselage proved to need strengthening; consequently, in October 1944 a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed [10]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe first version to be supplied in quantity to the Soviet Union was the P-63A-7 with a higher vertical tail, and reinforced wings and fuselage The fuselage proved to need strengthening; consequently, in October 1944 a reinforcement kit for operational P-63s was developed [10]\n\n\nFrance\nIn 1945, 114 later models were delivered to the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air), but they arrived too late to see service in World War II They did see service during the First Indochina War before being replaced in 1951.\n\n\n\"Pinball\" operations\nIts main use in American service was the unusual one of a manned flying target for gunnery practice [21] The aircraft was generally painted bright orange to increase its visibility All armament and the regular armor was removed from these RP-63 aircraft, and over a ton of armored sheet metal was applied to the aircraft This was fitted with sensors that would detect hits, and these hits were signaled by illuminating a light in the propeller hub where the cannon would have been This earned the aircraft the unofficial nickname of Pinball [21] Special frangible rounds made of a lead/Bakelite combination were developed that would disintegrate upon impact [21] These were known as the \"Cartridge, Caliber .30, Frangible, Ball, M22\" In 1990, veteran Pinball pilot, Ivan L Hickman, wrote Operation Pinball about the training flights [22]\n\n\nRAE Testing\nBritish engineers, like the Americans, had a growing interest during World War II in the application of laminar flow airfoils In an effort to learn more about the practical application of laminar flow airfoils, in 1945 the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) undertook a flight test program with one of the two P-63As that the United Kingdom had received [23] [page needed] The aircraft was equipped with a wake rake array mounted outboard, behind the wing, to allow the momentum deficit, and thus section drag, to be measured.\n\n\nPostwar air racers\nNumerous surplus P-63s ended up on the air racing circuit in the immediate postwar era Charles Tucker purchased two P-63s from the disposal facility at Kingman, Arizona just after the war He entered one of them, the Tucker Special as Race 28 with the name Flying Red Horse emblazoned on the nose (civilian register N62995) in the 1946 Thompson Trophy race He had clipped the wings by 12 ft 9 in (3.89 m) in an attempt to improve its speed, reducing the span to 25 ft 9 in (7.85 m) The second one (44-4126 (XN63231 Race 30)) was intended for the 1946 Bendix cross country race It was initially fitted with two wingtip drop tanks In 1947, the drop tanks were removed and the wings were clipped to 28 ft 6 in (8.69 m).\n\n\nVariants\nOn 3 June 2001, a Bell P-63A crashed during the Biggin Hill International Air Fair in London, England, killing the pilot The pilot was at the top of a vertical maneuver when

The six-part series premiered on FX on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore on 31 May 2022.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe six-part series follows Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and the band's rise to prominence and notoriety. The series explores the band's early days, their influence on the punk rock movement, and their subsequent controversy and downfall. The story is told through Steve Jones' perspective, with a focus on his relationships with his bandmates and the cultural context of the time.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe miniseries features a talented cast, including Toby Wallace as Steve Jones, Maisie Williams, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Talulah Riley, and Iris Law. The cast brings to life the complex and often tumultuous world of the Sex Pistols, capturing the band's energetic and rebellious spirit.\n\n**Main**\n\nThe miniseries was given a six-episode order from FX in January 2021, with Danny Boyle directing all six episodes. Boyle's frenzied direction brings plenty of energy to the series, but the rote conventions of a band's rise and fall make Pistol something of a misfire. The series explores the band's early days, their influence on the punk rock movement, and their subsequent controversy and downfall.\n\n**Recurring Themes**\n\nThroughout the series, several recurring themes emerge, including the tension between creativity and commercialism, the importance of individuality and rebellion, and the destructive power of fame and excess. The series also explores the complex relationships between the band members, including Steve Jones' close friendships with Paul Cook and Glen Matlock, and the tumultuous relationship between Steve Jones and Johnny Rotten (John Lydon).\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe six-episode series is divided into distinct chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of the band's history and Steve Jones' personal life. The episodes are titled:\n\n* Episode 1: \"Anarchy in the UK\"\n* Episode 2: \"Pretty Vacant\"\n* Episode 3: \"So Young, So Bad\"\n* Episode 4: \"Pretty Vacant (Again)\"\n* Episode 5: \"Anarchy in the UK (Again)\"\n* Episode 6: \"No One Is Innocent\"\n\n**Production**\n\nThe miniseries was filmed on location in the UK and features a mix of period-specific settings and modern-day locations. The production team worked closely with the Sex Pistols to ensure accuracy and authenticity, but not all band members were happy with the final product.\n\n**Legal Case over Music Rights**\n\nIn 2021, while the series was still in production, Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon criticised the series, branding it as \"The most disrespectful shit I've ever had to endure\". Former bandmates Steve Jones and Paul Cook sued Lydon to allow Sex Pistols music to be used in the series despite Lydon's objections. They said they had the support of Glen Matlock as well as the estate of Sid Vicious, and cited a 1998 agreement that allowed a majority decision among band members. Lydon lost the legal battle that August.\n\n**Release**\n\nPistol premiered on FX on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore on 31 May 2022. The series received widespread attention and sparked a renewed interest in the Sex Pistols and their music.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe series received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its energy and authenticity, while others found it formulaic and lacking in depth. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 65% approval rating based on 62 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. On Metacritic, the series has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nSome critics praised the series for its energetic and authentic portrayal of the Sex Pistols, while others found it formulaic and lacking in depth. The Guardian's Alex Macpherson wrote: \"Danny Boyle's frenzied direction brings plenty of energy to this punk biography, but the rote conventions of a band's rise and fall make Pistol something of a misfire\". The Daily Telegraph's Emma Brockes wrote: \"The series is a loving tribute to the Sex Pistols, but it's also a bit of a mess\".\n\n**Band Members' Response**\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian, John Lydon dismissed the series prior to seeing it as: \"It's dead against everything we once stood for. The only thing you've got of value in your life, and you're going to cheapen that because you want an extra fiver? Not much of a human being there\". After seeing the series, Lydon continued to express his disapproval, stating that it was \"karaoke\" and that the voices and mannerisms of the actors were \"off\".\n\n**Accolades**\n\nPistol was nominated for Photography & Lighting, Fiction and Production Design at the 2023 British Academy Television Awards.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations as they were not included in the original prompt.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Pistol on IMDB\n* Pistol on Wikipedia\n* Pistol on Disney+", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pistol_(miniseries)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPremise\nThe six-part series follows Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones and the band's rise to prominence and notoriety.\n\n\nCast\nThe miniseries, created by Craig Pearce, was given a six-episode order from FX in January 2021, with Danny Boyle directing all six episodes Toby Wallace was cast to play Jones, with Maisie Williams among the supporting cast [1] [2] Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Talulah Riley and Iris Law would join in March as filming began [3] Some filming was done in Hemel Hempstead, [4]\n\n\nMain\nThe miniseries, created by Craig Pearce, was given a six-episode order from FX in January 2021, with Danny Boyle directing all six episodes Toby Wallace was cast to play Jones, with Maisie Williams among the supporting cast [1] [2] Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Talulah Riley and Iris Law would join in March as filming began [3] Some filming was done in Hemel Hempstead, [4]\n\n\nRecurring\nThe miniseries, created by Craig Pearce, was given a six-episode order from FX in January 2021, with Danny Boyle directing all six episodes Toby Wallace was cast to play Jones, with Maisie Williams among the supporting cast [1] [2] Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Talulah Riley and Iris Law would join in March as filming began [3] Some filming was done in Hemel Hempstead, [4]\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe miniseries, created by Craig Pearce, was given a six-episode order from FX in January 2021, with Danny Boyle directing all six episodes Toby Wallace was cast to play Jones, with Maisie Williams among the supporting cast [1] [2] Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Talulah Riley and Iris Law would join in March as filming began [3] Some filming was done in Hemel Hempstead, [4]\n\n\nProduction\nThe miniseries, created by Craig Pearce, was given a six-episode order from FX in January 2021, with Danny Boyle directing all six episodes Toby Wallace was cast to play Jones, with Maisie Williams among the supporting cast [1] [2] Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Talulah Riley and Iris Law would join in March as filming began [3] Some filming was done in Hemel Hempstead, [4]\n\n\nLegal case over music rights\nIn 2021, while the series was still in production, Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon criticised the series, branding it as \"The most disrespectful shit I've ever had to endure\" [8] Former bandmates Steve Jones and Paul Cook sued Lydon to allow Sex Pistols music to be used in the series despite Lydon's objections [9] They said they had the support of Glen Matlock as well as the estate of Sid Vicious, and cited a 1998 agreement that allowed a majority decision among band members Lydon lost the legal battle that August [10]\n\n\nRelease\nPistol premiered on FX on Hulu in the US and Disney+ in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore on 31 May 2022 [11]\n\n\nReception\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 65% approval rating based on 62 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Danny Boyle's frenzied direction brings plenty of energy to this punk biography, but the rote conventions of a band's rise and fall make Pistol something of a misfire.\" [14] On Metacritic, the series has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [15]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 65% approval rating based on 62 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Danny Boyle's frenzied direction brings plenty of energy to this punk biography, but the rote conventions of a band's rise and fall make Pistol something of a misfire.\" [14] On Metacritic, the series has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [15]\n\n\nBand members' response\nSpeaking to The Guardian, John Lydon dismissed the series prior to seeing it as: \"It's dead against everything we once stood for The only thing you've got of value in your life, and you're going to cheapen that because you want an extra fiver?

He was known for his involvement in the 1998 massacre of the Castro Ramirez family in Ensenada, Baja California, which was a pivotal event in the cartel's takeover of the region.\n\n**Biography**\n\nRamón Arellano Félix was born in Mexico and grew up in a family with a history of involvement in organized crime. He was the brother of Benjamin Arellano Félix, a prominent member of the Arellano Félix Cartel. Standing at 189 cm (6 ft 2+1⁄2 in) and weighing 114.7 kg (253 lb), Arellano Félix was a large and intimidating figure.\n\nArellano Félix was allegedly responsible for ordering the 1998 massacre of the Castro Ramirez family, which consisted of 19 members. The family was related to an alleged associate of the Arellano Félix Cartel, and their murder eliminated the last bastion of opposition to the cartel's control of the area. This event broke an unspoken pact amongst drug lords: \"don't touch the children.\"\n\n**Kingpin Act Sanction**\n\nOn June 1, 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Ramón Arellano Félix under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, also known as the \"Kingpin Act.\" This act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with Arellano Félix, and virtually froze all his assets in the United States.\n\nThe Kingpin Act was a significant blow to Arellano Félix's operations, as it limited his ability to launder money and fund his cartel's activities. However, the act did not seem to deter Arellano Félix's involvement in organized crime, as he continued to be a suspect in various murders and other crimes.\n\n**Death and Aftermath**\n\nOn February 10, 2002, Ramón Arellano Félix was killed in a gunfight in Bugambilia Street, Mazatlán, Sinaloa. He was stopped by Mexican police officer Ángel Antonio Árias Torres due to a traffic infraction. Arellano Félix drew his gun and mortally wounded Árias Torres twice in the chest. However, Árias Torres managed to fire back and kill Arellano Félix with a single bullet to the head while falling to the ground and dying.\n\nAccording to Jesús Zambada García, also known as \"El Mayo,\" Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán ordered Árias Torres to enact the traffic stop and Arellano Félix's execution. This event marked a significant turning point in the Sinaloa cartel's struggle for power, as it eliminated a key rival and paved the way for Guzmán's rise to leadership.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nIn the 2017 Netflix and Univision series, El Chapo, Rolf Petersen plays Ramón Avendaño, a fictionalized portrayal of Ramón Arellano Félix. While the series takes creative liberties with the events surrounding Arellano Félix's life, it captures the essence of his involvement in organized crime and his eventual downfall.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**See Also**\n\n* Arellano Félix Cartel\n* Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán\n* Jesús Zambada García\n* Sinaloa cartel\n* Mexican drug war\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the information provided is based on publicly available sources.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ramón_Arellano_Félix\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nStanding 189 cm (6 ft 2+1⁄2 in) and 114.7 kg (253 lb), Ramon Arellano Félix was allegedly one of the most ruthless members of the cartel and was a suspect in various murders Arellano Félix ordered the 1998 massacre of nineteen members of Castro Ramirez family outside of Ensenada, Baja California The family was related to an alleged associate of the Arellano Félix Cartel [3] The Ramirez family oversaw the marijuana production and transport to Tecate and Tijuana, and was active before the Arellanos overtook the region By murdering the whole family, the Arellano Felix Cartel eliminated the last bastion to the Cartel's full control of the area The massacre broke an unspoken pact amongst druglords: \"don't touch the children.\"\n\n\nKingpin Act sanction\nOn 1 June 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Ramón under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \"Kingpin Act\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking, along with eleven other international criminals [6] The act prohibited U.S citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S [7]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nOn 10 February 2002, Ramón \nArellano Félix was killed in a gunfight in Bugambilia Street, Mazatlán, Sinaloa, where he was stopped due to a traffic infraction by Mexican police officer, Ángel Antonio Árias Torres Arellano Félix drew his gun and mortally wounded Árias Torres twice in the chest, who fired back and killed Arellano Félix with a single bullet in the head while falling to the ground and dying [citation needed] According to Jesús Zambada García (alias \"El Mayo\"), Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán ordered Árias Torres to enact the traffic stop and Arellano Félix's execution [8]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the 2017 Netflix and Univision series, El Chapo, Rolf Petersen plays Ramón Avendaño (a fictionalized portrayal of Ramón Arellano Félix).\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

his hometown of Hita, Ōita, which is surrounded by mountains [8] While working at an internet cafe, Isayama encountered a drunken customer who grabbed him by the collar It was this incident that showed him \"the fear of meeting a person I can't communicate with\", which is the feeling that he conveys through the Titans [9] When designing the appearances of the Titans, he uses several models such as martial artist Yushin Okami for Eren Yeager's Titan form, [10] as well as Brock Lesnar for the Armored Titan [11] George Wada, the anime's producer, stated that the \"Wall of Fear\" was influenced by the isolated and enclosed nature of Japanese culture [12] He also said that the inner feelings of every individual is one of the series' main themes [12] Isayama later would confirm that Attack on Titan was inspired in part by Muv-Luv Alternative, the second visual novel in the Muv-Luv visual novel series [13] Isayama also noted that his image of carnivorous titans was inspired by Gyaos from the Gamera franchise, The War of the Gargantuas, Man-eating Mona Lisa from the Jigoku Sensei Nūbē series, and dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park series [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nMedia\nAttack on

civilization inside three circular walls According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of human civilization Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling mobility in three dimensions Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear, and eventually rocket launcher–like weapons called Thunder Spears are

a 65-page one-shot version of Attack on Titan in 2006 [6] Originally, he offered his work to the Weekly Shōnen Jump department at Shueisha, where the editor of the department asked him to modify a few details in the story and artwork, which Isayama refused He instead brought the manga to the Weekly Shōnen Magazine department at Kodansha [7] Before serialization began in 2009, he had already thought of ideas for twists, although they are fleshed out as the series progresses The author initially based the scenery in the manga on that of his hometown of Hita, Ōita, which is surrounded by mountains [8] While working at an internet cafe, Isayama encountered a drunken customer who grabbed him by the collar It was this incident that showed him \"the fear of meeting a person I can't communicate with\", which is the feeling that he conveys through the Titans [9] When designing the appearances of the Titans, he uses several models such as martial artist Yushin Okami for Eren Yeager's Titan form, [10] as well as Brock Lesnar for the Armored Titan [11] George Wada, the anime's producer, stated that the \"Wall of Fear\" was influenced by the isolated and enclosed nature of Japanese culture [12] He also said that the inner feelings of every individual is one of the series' main themes [12] Isayama later would confirm that Attack on Titan was inspired in part by Muv-Luv Alternative, the second visual novel in the Muv-Luv visual novel series [13] Isayama also noted that his image of carnivorous titans was inspired by Gyaos from the Gamera franchise, The War of the Gargantuas, Man-eating Mona Lisa from the Jigoku Sensei Nūbē series, and dinosaurs from the Jurassic Park series [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nMedia\nAttack on Titan is written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama The series

an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008 On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964 Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time [9]\n\n\nDevelopment and preparations\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on Around The Rings that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons [13] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO [14]\n\n\nVenues and infrastructure\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues [15]\n\n\nOlympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit [19]\n\n\nFootball\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and the more distant Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\nUrban renovations\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as Porto Maravilha, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy [22]\n\n\nMedals\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian National Mint) The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016 They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem [24] [25]\n\n\nTorch relay\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva [27]\n\n\nVolunteers\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012 More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014 The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site [29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals [30]\n\n\nTicketing\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL) A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less [31] [32]\n\n\nSustainability\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\" [33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay, [33] [34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them [33] [35]\n\n\nThe Games\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracanã Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington [41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming [40] [42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion [5]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracanã Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington [41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming [40] [42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion [5]\n\n\nSports\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events The number of events in each of 42 discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n\nNew sports\nIn April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009 [50]\n\n\nParticipating National Olympic Committees\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete [citation needed] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games [58]\n\n\nNumber of athletes by National Olympic Committee\n11,238 athletes from 207 NOCs\n\n\nRefugee athletes\nDue to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs [64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team [65]\n\n\nIndependent athletes\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nNational houses\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro [69]\n\n\nCalendar\nThis is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015 [70]\n\n\nRecords\nTwenty-seven world records and ninety-one Olympic records were set during the 2016 Summer Olympics The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\nEvent scheduling\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m to midnight BRT These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016), [71] [72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m ET, 9:00 p.m to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country [73] [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nClosing ceremony\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium [77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame [78]\n\n\nCost\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games [80]\n\n\nMedal table\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below Host nation Brazil finished in 13th place with a total of 19 medals (7 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze).\n\n\nPodium sweeps\nOlympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster [86] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats [87] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers [88] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS [86]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nOlympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage

2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third The next category was the best

and Paralympics were unveiled, created by São Paulo-based animation company Birdo [91] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds [91] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\" [92]\n\n\nMascots\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by São Paulo-based animation company Birdo [91] The Olympic mascot

both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\" [92]\n\n\nEmblem\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies [96] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics [97]\n\n\nConcerns and controversies\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics, [99] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident [100] [101] [102]\n\n\nPolitical and economic crisis\nThere is no legally legitimate evidence of impropriety in the choice of Rio to host the Olympic games, at least as far as the Brazilian Olympic Committee or the politicians involved in the process are concerned [103] However, the specialized media raised suspicions about it In 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters, [104] both anti- and pro-Rousseff [105] [106] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games [107]\n\n\nZika virus\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues [114] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games [115]\n\n\nEnvironmental problems\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay [122] [123] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues [34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated; [124] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated, [125] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics [126]\n\n\nSecurity\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process [127]\n\n\nRussian doping scandal\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents [130] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive  [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\" [131]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2016 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXXI Olympiad, were an

The number of events in each of 42 discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n**New sports**\n\nIn April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme. Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.\n\n**Participating National Olympic Committees**\n\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete. The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.\n\n**Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee**\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 NOCs.\n\n**Refugee athletes**\n\nDue to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs. On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.\n\n**Independent athletes**\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n**National houses**\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.\n\n**Calendar**\n\nThis is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015.\n\n**Records**\n\nTwenty-seven world records and ninety-one Olympic records were set during the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n**Event scheduling**\n\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016).\n\n**Closing ceremony**\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium. As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.\n\n**Medal table**\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below. Host nation Brazil finished in 13th place with a total of 19 medals (7 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze).\n\n**Podium sweeps**\n\nOlympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games. Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster. NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats. In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers. Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nOlympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the 2016 Games.

The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show Esporte Espetacular finished third, and CCTV from China feature A Sequel of Love came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature The Most Beautiful Thing. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by São Paulo-based animation company Birdo. The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds. According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".\n\n**Mascots**\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by São Paulo-based animation company Birdo.

According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".\n\n**Emblem**\n\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tatíl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies. The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.\n\n**Concerns and controversies**\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics, and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.\n\n**Political and economic crisis**\n\nThere is no legally legitimate evidence of impropriety in the choice of Rio to host the Olympic games, at least as far as the Brazilian Olympic Committee or the politicians involved in the process are concerned. However, the specialized media raised suspicions about it. In 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters, both anti- and pro-Rousseff. At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12 May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.\n\n**Zika virus**\n\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues. Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.\n\n**Environmental problems**\n\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay. However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues. Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated; this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated, at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.\n\n**Security**\n\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.\n\n**Russian doping scandal**\n\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2016_Summer_Olympics\" following this outline:\n\n\nBidding process\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16 May 2007 [8] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13 September 2007, confirming their intention to bid Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008 On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964 Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time [9]\n\n\nDevelopment and preparations\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on Around The Rings that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons [13] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO [14]\n\n\nVenues and infrastructure\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues [15]\n\n\nOlympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The site was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepaguá Formula One circuit [19]\n\n\nFootball\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and the more distant Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\nUrban renovations\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as Porto Maravilha, covering 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi) in area The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy [22]\n\n\nMedals\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian National Mint) The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016 They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem [24] [25]\n\n\nTorch relay\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21 April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27 April A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva [27]\n\n\nVolunteers\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012 More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014 The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site [29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals [30]\n\n\nTicketing\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL) A total of 7.5 million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony About 3.8 million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less [31] [32]\n\n\nSustainability\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\" [33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay, [33] [34] and plant 24 million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them [33] [35]\n\n\nThe Games\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracanã Stadium on 5 August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington [41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming [40] [42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion [5]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracanã Stadium on

rightsholder Rede Globo As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m ET, 9:00 p.m to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country [73] [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nClosing ceremony\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracanã Stadium [77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and

Founded by Joseph J DePaolo, the bank was known for its focus on serving the needs of high-net-worth individuals and middle-market business managers. In its final years, the bank gained attention for its involvement in the cryptocurrency sector, which ultimately contributed to its collapse.\n\nEstablishment and Expansion\n-------------------------\n\nSignature Bank opened on May 1, 2001, after its founders, Joseph J DePaolo, Scott A Shay, and John Tamberlane, left Republic National Bank of New York following its acquisition by HSBC. The bank was established with the goal of serving wealthy clients and middle-market business managers with $250,000 in assets. DePaolo described the target audience as \"the guy who started his business in Brooklyn and is now worth $20 million.\" The bank was initially capitalized with over $60 million in funding from Bank Hapoalim of Israel. Among the bank's first employees were 65 former Republic Bank employees who left en masse on April 27, days before Signature opened its branches.\n\nThe bank quickly grew to $950 million in assets by February 2003, ranking in the top five percent of US commercial banks just 20 months after being founded and beginning to turn a profit. Signature Bank adopted a strategy of putting its assets in instruments with lower yields, which led to a net interest margin of 2.8 percent, lower than many comparable banks.\n\nOperations in the Final Years\n-----------------------------\n\nSignature Bank offered a range of business and personal banking products and services, with a focus on lending and deposits. The bank utilized a team model, paying its bankers on an \"eat-what-you-kill\" basis reminiscent of brokerage firms. In 2015, nearly 150 senior bankers reported directly to DePaolo, with some making more than the CEO. The bank cultivated a reputation for being loyal to its clients, which in turn incentivized them to conduct further banking business with Signature.\n\nAmong the company's nine national businesses in 2022 were commercial real estate lending, fund banking for private equity investors, venture banking for the technology industry, specialized mortgage banking, and corporate mortgage finance.

In 2021, more than 16 percent of its deposits came from the sector, a figure that had risen to 30 percent by February 2023.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency enthusiasts boosted the bank's stock from $75 to $375 a share in little over a year, this strategy proved risky and gave the bank an image of being a \"crypto bank.\" Founder DePaolo tried to shed this label in an interview with the Financial Times in July 2022. After consistently growing deposits, the bank began to experience outflows of deposits from the bank evenly split between crypto clients and its New York private banking customers.\n\nControversies\n------------\n\nSignature Bank was known for its connections to the Trump Organization, with the bank helping to finance Trump's Florida golf course. Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump's daughter, served on Signature Bank's board of directors between 2011 and 2013, before stepping down on April 24, 2013.

 four years after being created, the fund banking portfolio had become Signature's largest asset, representing 41 percent of the bank's loan portfolio at the end of 2021 [28]: 11 \n\n\nCryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency became a focus of the bank's activities in its final years after deciding to accept customers from the industry in 2018, [35] and the ability of cryptocurrency companies to utilize the services of banks like Signature gave the sector legitimacy and credibility [36] In 2021, more than 16 percent of its deposits came from the sector, [37] a figure that had risen to 30 percent by February 2023 [32] It also held reserves from the Circle-managed USDC [37] While cryptocurrency enthusiasts boosted the bank's stock from $75 to $375 a share in little over a year, [32] this strategy proved risky and gave the bank an image of being a \"crypto bank\", a label founder DePaolo tried to shed in an interview with the Financial Times in July 2022 After consistently growing deposits, it began to experience outflows of deposits from the bank evenly split between crypto clients—as part of a strategy to actively reduce its deposits from digital asset lending [3]—and its New York private banking customers, some of whom sought higher yields from accounts at other institutions as interest rates rose [17] Some investors privately raised concern about liquidity: per the Financial Times, \"as Signature banks eight of the 12 largest crypto brokers, for instance, an implosion of the industry in a credit crunch could see their deposits rapidly evaporate\" [35] The bank, in response, reduced its involvement in the sector [32] and pushed out some $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency-related deposits [32] [16] After the bank collapsed, a report from Bloomberg News indicated that the United States Department of Justice and United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were investigating Signature to see if it sufficiently scrutinized cryptocurrency-related transactions for potential money laundering [38] [39] The Financial Times noted that Marc Cohodes, a short seller of Signature, had written the Department of Justice in January 2023 warning that the bank had served as \"a facilitator, even if unwitting, for countless illegal crypto transactions\" due to its lax procedures [40]\n\n\nControversies\nOn July 13, 2018, The New York Times printed a full-length article on Signature Bank being the \"go-to bank\" to Donald Trump and the Trump family The bank helped finance Trump's Florida golf course [43] Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump served on Signature Bank's board of directors between 2011 and 2013, before stepping down on April 24, 2013 [44] Throughout most of the 2010s, the bank provided loans to people connected with the Trump Organization, while Ivanka Trump sat on its board of directors [45] On January 11, 2021—in the aftermath of the January 6 United States Capitol attack—the bank closed two of Trump's personal accounts containing $5.3 million and called for him to resign from office, citing \"the best interests of our nation and the American people\" [46]\n\n\nCollapse\nOn Sunday, March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS); New York state officials had wanted to take over the institution since Friday and began lobbying the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, and FDIC to let it assume control of the bank [36] The bank proved unable to close a sale or otherwise bolster its finances before Monday morning, when it would have faced an avalanche of withdrawal requests placed over the weekend by nervous customers, in order to protect its assets after customers began withdrawing their deposits in favor of bigger institutions; it was losing deposits so fast that it was forced to ask the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York for money twice within 90 minutes [17] The bank's failure [56] [57] [58] was designated as a systemic risk to the financial system, allowing for extraordinary measures to be taken to ensure the availability of funds beyond the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured $250,000 [59] The DFS report later noted that Signature was dilatory in producing information to regulators in the crisis period and that the data regulators received was \"inconsistent and .. continuously changed in material ways\" [28]: 35 \n\n\nDisposition of assets\nOn March 19, 2023, the FDIC announced that certain deposits and loans of Signature Bridge Bank would be assumed by New York Community Bancorp, the parent of New York Community Bank, with the 40 branches to be absorbed by its Flagstar Bank subsidiary effective Monday, March 20 [1] [72]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
