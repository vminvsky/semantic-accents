poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province; he was raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina [4] [5] He was the first son after four daughters He has two younger brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Raúl (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players [6] [7] His father Diego Maradona \"Chitoro\" (1927–2015), who worked at a chemicals factory, was of Guaraní (Indigenous) and Galician (Spanish) descent, [8] and his mother Dalma Salvadora Franco, \"Doña Tota\" (1930–2011), was of Italian and Croatian descent [9] [10] [11] [12]\n\n\nClub career\nOn 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors, 10 days before his 16th birthday, [21] versus Talleres de Córdoba He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey, and became the youngest player in the history of the Argentine Primera División A few minutes into his debut, Maradona kicked the ball through the legs of Juan Domingo Cabrera, a nutmeg that would become symbolic of his talent [22] After the game, Maradona said: \"That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands.\" [23] Thirty years later, Cabrera remembered Maradona's debut: \"I was on the right side of the field and went to press him, but he didn't give me a chance He made the nutmeg and when I turned around, he was far away from me.\" [24] Maradona scored his first goal in the Primera División against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976, two weeks after turning 16 [25]\n\n\nArgentinos Juniors\nOn 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors, 10 days before his 16th birthday, [21] versus Talleres de Córdoba He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey, and became the youngest player in the

the game, Maradona said: \"That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands.\" [23] Thirty years later, Cabrera remembered Maradona's debut: \"I was on the right side of the field and went to press him, but he didn't give me a chance He made the nutmeg and when I turned around, he was far away from me.\" [24] Maradona scored his first goal in the Primera División against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976, two weeks after turning 16 [25]\n\n\nBoca Juniors\nMaradona spent five years at Argentinos Juniors, from 1976 to 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his US$4 million transfer to Boca Juniors [26] Maradona received offers to join other clubs, including River Plate who offered to make him the club's best paid player [27] However, River decided to drop its bid due to its large payroll in keeping Daniel Passarella and Ubaldo Fillol [28]\n\n\nBarcelona\n\"He had complete mastery of the ball When Maradona ran with the ball or dribbled through the defence, he seemed to have the ball tied to his boots I remember our early training sessions with him: the rest of the team were so amazed that they just stood and watched him We all thought ourselves privileged to be witnesses of his genius.\"\n\n\nNapoli\nMaradona arrived in Naples and was presented to the world media as a Napoli player on 5 July 1984, where he was welcomed by 75,000 fans at his presentation at the Stadio San Paolo [45] Sports writer David Goldblatt commented, \"They  [the fans] were convinced that the saviour had arrived.\" [46] A local newspaper stated that despite the lack of a \"mayor, houses, schools, buses, employment and sanitation, none of this matters because we have Maradona\" [46] Prior to Maradona's arrival, Italian football was dominated by teams from the north and centre of the country, such as AC Milan, Juventus, Inter Milan and Roma, and no team in the south of the Italian Peninsula had ever won a league title This was perhaps the perfect scenario for Maradona and his working-class-sympathetic image, as he joined a once-great team that was facing relegation at the end of the 1983–84 Serie A season, in what was the toughest and most highly regarded football league in Europe [46] [47]\n\n\nLate career\nAfter serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine, Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992 Despite interest from Real Madrid and Marseille, he signed for Sevilla, where he stayed for one year [66] In 1993, he played for Newell's Old Boys and in 1995 returned to Boca Juniors for a two-year stint [21] Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a testimonial match for Osvaldo Ardiles against Internazionale, shortly before the 1986 World Cup [67] In 1996, he played in a friendly match alongside his brother Raul for Toronto Italia

himself given a testimonial match in November 2001, played between an all-star World XI and the Argentina national team, scoring two penalty kicks in a 6–3 win [70]\n\n\nInternational career\nMaradona made his full international debut at age 16, against Hungary, on 27 February 1977, only four months after his professional debut for the Argentinos Juniors team [71]\n\n\nDebut at age 16; 1979 World

[71]\n\n\n1982 World Cup\nMaradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona Maradona did not perform to expectations, [80] as Argentina, the defending champions, lost 1–0 Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador in Alicante to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger, less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players With a team that also included such players as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ramón Díaz, Daniel Bertoni, Alberto Tarantini, Ubaldo Fillol and Daniel Passarella, the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina at the Sarrià Stadium in Barcelona, 2–1 [81]\n\n\n1986 World Cup\nMaradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, winning the final in Mexico City against West Germany [83] Throughout the tournament, Maradona asserted his dominance

South Korea at the Olímpico Universitario Stadium in Mexico City His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in Puebla [84] Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla, setting up a match against England at the Azteca Stadium, also in Mexico City.\n\n\n1990 World Cup\nMaradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 World Cup in Italy to yet another World Cup final An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier, and the team were missing three of their best players due to injury After losing their opening game to Cameroon at the San Siro in Milan, Argentina were almost eliminated in the group stage, only qualifying in third position from their group In the round of 16 match against Brazil in Turin, Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona [106]\n\n\n1993 Artemio Franchi Cup\nOn 24 February 1993, Maradona returned to the team when Argentina

Maradona played in only two games (both at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston), scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping [108] After scoring Argentina's third goal against Greece, Maradona had one of the most remarkable World Cup goal celebrations as he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes, in sheer elation of his return to international football [109] This turned out to be Maradona's last international goal for Argentina [110] In the second game, a 2–1 victory over Nigeria which was to be his last game for Argentina, he set up both of his team's goals on free kicks, the second an assist to Caniggia, in what were two very strong showings by the Argentine team [111]\n\n\nCopa América (1979, 1987 and 1989)\nMaradona appeared in three Copa Américas (1979, 1987 and 1989), but never won the title At the 1987 Copa América in Argentina, he scored three goals in four matches, but Argentinia lost the semi-final 0–1 against eventual winners Uruguay [116]\n\n\nInofficial internationals\nAlongside official internationals, Maradona also played and scored for an Argentina XI against the World XI in 1978 to mark the first anniversary of their first World Cup win, [117] [118] scored for The Americas against the World in a UNICEF fundraiser a short time after the 1986 triumph, [117] [118] a year after that captained the 'Rest of the World' against the English Football League XI to celebrate the organization's centenary (after reportedly securing a £100,000 appearance fee) [119] [120] and was on the scoresheet for the Argentina XI once more in his own 'farewell match' in 2001 [121]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nDescribed as a \"classic number 10\" in the media, [122] Maradona was a traditional playmaker who usually played in a free role, either as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, or as a second striker in a front–two, [123] [124] [125] although he was also deployed as an offensive–minded central midfielder in a 4–4–2 formation on occasion [126] [127] [128] [129] A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname \"El Pibe de Oro\" (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career [130] He was renowned for his dribbling ability, vision, close ball control, passing and creativity, and is considered to have been one of the most skilful players in the sport [97] [131] [132] He had a compact physique, and with his strong legs, low center of gravity, and resulting balance, he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball, despite his small stature, [100] [133] [134] while his acceleration, quick feet, and agility, combined with his dribbling skills and close control at speed, allowed him to change direction quickly, making him difficult for opponents to defend against [135] [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nStyle of play\nDescribed as a \"classic number 10\" in the media, [122] Maradona was a traditional playmaker

R. Martin**\n\nGeorge Raymond Martin, commonly referred to as George R. R. Martin, is an American novelist and short story writer in the fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres. He is best known for his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, which was adapted into the popular HBO television series Game of Thrones.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin was born on September 20, 1948, in Bayonne, New Jersey, to Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. His mother's family was once wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the Great Depression. Martin's family struggled financially, but he found solace in reading and writing. He developed a love for science fiction and fantasy early on, influenced by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.\n\n**Career**\n\nMartin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at the age of 21. His first sale was \"The Hero,\" sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue. Other sales soon followed, and he gained recognition within the science fiction community. In 1973, his story \"With Morning Comes Mistfall\" was nominated for the Hugo Award and Nebula Awards.\n\n**Teaching**\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Guthridge was initially uninterested in science fiction and fantasy, but Martin's enthusiasm eventually won him over. Guthridge has since become a prominent science fiction author, winning the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in the Novel for his Children of the Dusk.\n\n**Concentration on Writing**\n\nAfter the sudden death of friend and fellow author Tom Reamy in 1977, Martin reevaluated his life and decided to focus on writing full-time. He resigned from his job and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lived alone for almost three years. This period was incredibly productive for Martin, as he worked on various writing projects, including the A Song of Ice and Fire series.\n\n**A Song of Ice and Fire**\n\nIn 1991, Martin began working on the A Song of Ice and Fire series, which was initially intended to be a single novel. The series gradually expanded to encompass seven planned volumes, with the first book, A Game of Thrones, published in 1996. The series was adapted into the hit HBO television series Game of Thrones in 2011, which ran for eight seasons and became a global phenomenon.\n\n**HBO Adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire**\n\nHBO Productions purchased the television rights for the A Song of Ice and Fire series in 2007, and Martin was heavily involved in the production. He participated in scriptwriting and selection of the production team, and was listed as a co-executive producer of the series.\n\n**Themes**\n\nMartin's work is characterized by complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, and perfect pacing. His stories often feature tragic heroes and antiheroes, and he explores themes of power, morality, and the human condition. His writing is often described as dark and cynical, but also nuanced and thought-provoking.\n\n**Producing**\n\nIn addition to writing, Martin has also ventured into producing. In 2017, he confirmed that he would serve as an executive producer of the HBO television series adaptation of the science fantasy novel Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor. He has also contributed to the video game Elden Ring, writing the worldbuilding aspects for it.\n\n**Relationship with Fans**\n\nMartin is known for his accessibility to fans and his regular attendance at science fiction conventions. He has a strong connection with his readers and is active on social media, often engaging with fans and responding to their questions and comments.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nMartin has faced criticism from some of his readers for the long periods between books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series. However, he has always maintained that he is working on multiple projects simultaneously and that the delay is a result of his dedication to quality and his desire to explore other creative endeavors.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMartin has been in a relationship with fellow science fiction author Lisa Tuttle, with whom he co-wrote the novel Windhaven. He has also been involved in various charitable efforts, including a campaign to raise funds for the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nIn 2014, Martin launched a campaign on Prizeo to raise funds for the Wild Spirit Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe. The campaign garnered media attention and raised a total of $502,549.\n\n**Politics**\n\nMartin has been a vocal critic of war and has expressed his opposition to the Vietnam War. He has also spoken out against the Iraq War and has been an advocate for social justice and human rights.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nMartin has received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Hugo Award, Nebula Award, and the Bram Stoker Award. He has also been nominated for various other awards, including the World Fantasy Award and the Locus Award.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nMartin's bibliography includes numerous novels, short stories, and essays.

The NYSE announced that trading in these companies would cease due to the executive order's prohibition on U.S. investors purchasing or investing in securities of \"Communist Chinese military companies.\"\n\nIn late February, the NYSE announced that trading in CNOOC would also cease on March 9, 2021. This decision was made in response to the executive order's requirements and the company's status as a \"Communist Chinese military company.\"\n\n## Impact and Controversy\n\nThe executive order has been met with both praise and criticism from various stakeholders. Supporters argue that the order is necessary to protect U.S. national security and prevent the financing of companies that may be involved in human rights abuses or other wrongdoing. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the order is overly broad and may have unintended consequences, such as harming the U.S. economy or complying companies' employees.\n\nThe executive order has also been criticized for its potential impact on U.S. companies that do business with China, particularly those in the technology sector. Some argue that the order may drive companies to relocate their operations to other countries or abandon their Chinese business altogether.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nExecutive Order 13959 is a significant development in the complex and often contentious relationship between the United States and China. The order's prohibition on U.S. investors purchasing or investing in securities of \"Communist Chinese military companies\" has significant implications for U.S. companies, investors, and the broader economy.

The family's origins can be traced back to Julia Hauke, a woman of Polish and German descent, who married Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine in 1851. Julia was created Countess of Battenberg with the style of Illustrious Highness (HIllH) by her brother-in-law, Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe Battenberg family was a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, which formerly ruled the Grand Duchy of Hesse in what is now Germany. The first member of the Battenberg family was Julia Hauke, whose brother-in-law, Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse, created her Countess of Battenberg with the style of Illustrious Highness (HIllH) in 1851, on the occasion of her morganatic marriage to Grand Duke Louis' brother, Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine. In 1858, Julia was elevated in title to Princess of Battenberg, with the style of Serene Highness (HSH).\n\n**Members**\n\nThe marquessate of Milford Haven was created in 1917 for Prince Louis of Battenberg, the former First Sea Lord, and a relation to the British royal family. He was at the same time made Earl of Medina and Viscount Alderney, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Princess Alice of Battenberg never took the name Mountbatten as she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903; her son, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, took the name upon becoming a naturalised British citizen.\n\n**Marquesses of Milford Haven**\n\nThe marquessate of Milford Haven was created in 1917 for Prince Louis of Battenberg, the former First Sea Lord, and a relation to the British royal family. He was at the same time made Earl of Medina and Viscount Alderney, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Princess Alice of Battenberg never took the name Mountbatten as she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark in 1903; her son, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, took the name upon becoming a naturalised British citizen.\n\n**Earls Mountbatten of Burma**\n\nEarl Mountbatten of Burma is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1947 for Rear Admiral Louis Mountbatten, 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, youngest son of the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven and the last Viceroy of India. The letters patent creating the title specified the following special remainder to his daughters. The subsidiary titles of the Earldom are Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, of Romsey in the County of Southampton, created 1946, and Baron Romsey, of Romsey in the County of Southampton, created in 1947. Both of these titles, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, have the same special remainder as the Earldom.\n\n**Marquess of Carisbrooke**\n\nMarquess of Carisbrooke was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1917 for Prince Alexander of Battenberg, eldest son of Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom and Prince Henry of Battenberg. He was made Viscount Launceston, in the County of Cornwall, and Earl of Berkhampsted at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The titles became extinct upon Lord Carisbrooke's death in 1960, as he had no sons.\n\n**Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh**\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the son of Princess Alice of Battenberg and grandson of the 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, took the name Mountbatten when he became a naturalised British subject. Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten married Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King George VI of the United Kingdom, on 20 November 1947. In 1952, on the accession of his wife as Queen Elizabeth II, there was some dispute regarding the dynasty to which descendants of Elizabeth and Phillip would belong. Queen Mary (the new Queen's grandmother) expressed to Prime Minister Winston Churchill her aversion to the idea of the House of Mountbatten succeeding the House of Windsor as the royal dynasty, and so it remained Windsor.\n\n**Mountbatten-Windsor**\n\nMountbatten-Windsor is the personal surname of some of the descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh under an Order in Council issued in 1960, which has not been applied consistently. While the order specifically applies the surname \"Mountbatten-Windsor\" to Elizabeth's male-line descendants not holding royal styles and titles, \"Mountbatten-Windsor\" has been formally used by some of her descendants who do hold royal styles. The surname was first officially used by Princess Anne in 1973, in the wedding register for her marriage to Mark Phillips. Prince William and his wife Catherine used the names \"Monsieur et Madame Mountbatten-Windsor\" when filing a French lawsuit against the French magazine Closer. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan named their children Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor from birth, although the children formally became a prince and princess on the accession of their grandfather to the throne on 8 September 2022.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe city of Ottawa, Ontario, erected Mountbatten Avenue in memory of the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. A Royal Canadian Sea Cadets corps, RCSCC No 134 Admiral Mountbatten, was named after him in 1946. A 9 ft 5 in (2.9 m) bronze statue by Franta Belsky of Lord Mountbatten of Burma was erected in 1983 outside the Foreign Office, overlooking Horse Guards Parade. The earl is dressed in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet.\n\n**Coats of Arms**\n\nThe family's coats of arms are rich in history and symbolism.

{"title": "Gaza_Strip", "content": "\nHistory\nHistorically part of the Palestine region, the area was controlled since the 16th century by the Ottoman Empire; in 1906, the Ottomans and the British Empire set the region's international border with Egypt [36] With the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I and the subsequent partition of the Ottoman Empire, the British deferred the governance of the Gaza Strip area to Egypt, which declined the responsibility [37] Britain itself kept and ruled the territory it occupied in 1917–18, from 1920 until 1948 under the internationally accepted frame of \"Mandatory Palestine\".\n\n\n1948–1959: All-Palestine government\n\n\n1956–1957: Israeli occupation\nDuring the 1956 Suez Crisis (the Second Arab–Israeli war), Israel invaded Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula On 3 November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attacked Egyptian and Palestinian forces at Khan Yunis [42] The city of Khan Yunis resisted being captured, and Israel responded with a heavy bombing campaign that inflicted heavy civilian casualties [43] After a fierce battle, the Israeli 37th Armored Brigade's Sherman tanks broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade [44]\n\n\n1959–1967: Egyptian occupation\nAfter the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy Gaza until 1967 Egypt never annexed the Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor [51] The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were expelled from their homes during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza [52] resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from Gaza, its inhabitants could not look elsewhere for gainful employment [53]\n\n\n1967: Israeli occupation\nIn June 1967, during the Six-Day War, IDF captured Gaza Under the then head of Israel's Southern Command Ariel Sharon, dozens of Palestinians, suspected of being members of the resistance, were executed without trial [54]\n\n\n1987: First Intifada\nThe First Intifada was a sustained series of protests and violent riots carried out by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel [65] It was motivated by collective Palestinian frustration over Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as it approached a twenty-year mark, having begun after Israel's victory in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War [66] The uprising lasted from December 1987 until the Madrid Conference of 1991, though some date its conclusion to 1993, with the signing of the Oslo Accords.\n\n\n1994: Gaza under Palestinian Authority\nIn May 1994, following the Palestinian-Israeli agreements known as the Oslo Accords, a phased transfer of governmental authority to the Palestinians took place Much of the Strip came under Palestinian control, except for the settlement blocs and military areas The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas, leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas The Palestinian Authority, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza City as its first provincial headquarters In September 1995, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed a second agreement, extending the Palestinian Authority to most West Bank towns.\n\n\n2000: Second Intifada\nThe Second Intifada was a major Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel The general triggers for the unrest are speculated to have been centred on the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit, which was expected to reach a final agreement on the Israeli–Palestinian peace process in July 2000 [75] Outbreaks of violence began in September 2000, after Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli opposition leader, made a provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa compound on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; [75] the visit itself was peaceful, but, as anticipated, sparked protests and riots that Israeli police put down with rubber bullets and tear gas [76] The Second Intifada also marked the beginning of rocket attacks and bombings of Israeli border localities by Palestinian guerrillas from the Gaza Strip, especially by the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad movements.\n\n\n2005: Israel's unilateral disengagement\nIn 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip and dismantled its settlements [86] Israel also withdrew from the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip of land adjacent to the border with Egypt, after Egypt agreed to secure its side of the border after the Agreement on Movement and Access, known as the Rafah Agreement [87] The Gaza Strip was left under the control of the Palestinian Authority [88]\n\n\nPost-2006: Hamas takeover\nIn the Palestinian parliamentary elections held on 25 January 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 42.9% of the total vote and 74 out of 132 total seats (56%) [89] [90] When Hamas assumed power the next month, Israel, the United States, the EU, Russia and the UN demanded that Hamas accept all previous agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist, and renounce violence; when Hamas refused, [91] they cut off direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, although some aid money was redirected to humanitarian organizations not affiliated with the government [92] The resulting political disorder and economic stagnation led to many Palestinians emigrating from the Gaza Strip [93]\n\n\n2007: Fatah–Hamas conflict\nFollowing the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Hamas and Fatah formed the Palestinian authority national unity government headed by Ismail Haniyeh Shortly after, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the Battle of Gaza (June 2007), [103] seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own [104] By 14 June, Hamas fully controlled the Gaza Strip Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responded by declaring a state of emergency, dissolving the unity government and forming a new government without Hamas participation PNA security forces in the West Bank arrested a number of Hamas members \n\n\nEgyptian border barrier breach\nOn 23 January 2008, after months of preparation during which the steel reinforcement of the border barrier was weakened, [109] Hamas destroyed several parts of the wall dividing Gaza and Egypt in the town of Rafah Hundreds of thousands of Gazans crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies Due to the crisis, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered his troops to allow the Palestinians in but to verify that they did not bring weapons back across the border [110] Egypt arrested and later released several armed Hamas militants in the Sinai who presumably wanted to infiltrate into Israel At the same time, Israel increased its state of alert along the length of the Israel–Egypt Sinai border, and warned its citizens to leave Sinai \"without delay.\"\n\n\n2008–2009: Gaza War\nOn 27 December 2008, [112] Israeli F-16 fighters launched a series of air strikes against targets in Gaza following the breakdown of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas [113] Israel began a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip on 3 January 2009 [114] Various sites that Israel claimed were being used as weapons depots were struck from the air : police stations, schools, hospitals, UN warehouses, mosques, various Hamas government buildings and other buildings [115]\n\n\n2014: Gaza War\nOn 5 June 2014, Fatah signed a unity agreement with the Hamas political party [128]\n\n\n2018–2019: Great March of Return\nIn 2018–2019, a series of protests, also known as the Great March of Return, were held each Friday in the Gaza Strip near the Israel–Gaza barrier from 30 March 2018 until 27 December 2019, during which a total of 223 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces [133] [134] The demonstrators demanded that the Palestinian refugees must be allowed to return to lands they were displaced from in what is now Israel They protested against Israel's land, air and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip and the United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel [135] [136] [137]\n\n\n2021: Israel–Palestine crisis\nBefore the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Gaza had 48% unemployment and half of the population lived in poverty During the crisis, 66 children died (551 children in the previous conflict) On 13 June 2021, a high level World Bank delegation visited Gaza to witness the damage Mobilization with UN and EU partners is ongoing to finalize a needs assessment in support of Gaza's reconstruction and recovery [146]\n\n\n2023–2024: Israel–Hamas war\nOn 7 October 2023, the paramilitaries in Gaza, led by the Hamas's Al-Qassam Brigades, invaded southwest Israel, targeting Israeli communities and military bases, killing at least 1,300 people and taking at least 236 hostages [149] On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and imposed a \"total blockade\" of the Gaza Strip, [150] with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declaring, \"There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\" [151] [152] Gallant changed his position after pressure from US President Joe Biden, and a deal was made on 19 October for Israel and Egypt to allow aid into Gaza [153] Gaza is currently undergoing a severe humanitarian crisis [154] By 13 November 2023, one out of every 200 people in Gaza were killed, becoming one out of every 100 by January 2024 [155] [156]\n\n\nGeography\nThe Gaza Strip is 41 km (25 mi) long, from 6 to 12 km (3.7 to 7.5 mi) wide, and has a total area of 365 km2 (141 sq mi) [27] [9] It has a 51 km (32 mi) border with Israel, and an 11 km (7 mi) border with Egypt, near the city of Rafah [163]\n\n\nClimate\nThe Gaza Strip has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh), with warm winters during which practically all the annual rainfall occurs, and dry, hot summers Despite the dryness, humidity is high throughout the year Annual rainfall is higher than in any part of Egypt at between 225 mm (9 in) in the south and 400 mm (16 in) in the north, but almost all of this falls between November and February.\n\n\nEnvironment issues\nEnvironmental problems in Gaza include desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources A United Nations official said in 2024 that \"it could take 14 years .. to clear debris, including rubble from destroyed buildings\" (of the Israel–Hamas war) [168]\n\n\nGovernance\nSince its takeover of Gaza, Hamas has exercised executive authority over the Gaza Strip, and it governs the territory through its own ad hoc executive, legislative, and judicial bodies [169] The Hamas government of 2012 was the second Palestinian Hamas-dominated government, ruling over the Gaza Strip, since the split of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007 It was announced in early September 2012 [170] The reshuffle of the previous government was approved by Gaza-based Hamas MPs from the Palestinian Legislative Council or parliament [170] Since the Hamas takeover in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been described as a \"de facto one-party state\", although it tolerates other political groups, including leftist ones such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [171] [15]\n\n\nHamas government\nSince its takeover of Gaza, Hamas has exercised executive authority over the Gaza Strip, and it governs the territory through its own ad hoc executive, legislative, and judicial bodies [169] The Hamas government of 2012 was the second Palestinian Hamas-dominated government, ruling over the Gaza Strip, since the split of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007 It was announced in early September 2012 [170] The reshuffle of the previous government was approved by Gaza-based Hamas MPs from the Palestinian Legislative Council or parliament [170] Since the Hamas takeover in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been described as a \"de facto one-party state\", although it tolerates other political groups, including leftist ones such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [171] [15]\n\n\nSecurity\nThe Gaza Strip's security is mainly handled by Hamas through its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, internal security service, and civil police force The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades have an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 operatives [174]\n\n\nOther groups and ideologies\nOther Palestinian militant factions operate in the Gaza Strip alongside, and sometimes opposed to Hamas The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, also known as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second largest militant faction operating in the Gaza Strip Its military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, has an estimated 8,000 fighters [175] [176]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe enclave is divided into five governorates: the North Gaza Governorate, Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah Governorate, Khan Yunis Governorate and Rafah Governorate.\n\n\nLegality of Hamas rule\nAfter Hamas's June 2007 takeover, it ousted Fatah-linked officials from positions of power and authority (such as government positions, security services, universities, newspapers, etc.) and strove to enforce law by progressively removing guns from the hands of peripheral militias, clans, and criminal groups, and gaining control of supply tunnels According to Amnesty International, under Hamas rule, newspapers were closed down and journalists were harassed [179] Fatah demonstrations were forbidden or suppressed, as in the case of a large demonstration on the anniversary of Yasser Arafat's death, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, after protesters hurled stones at Hamas security forces [180]\n\n\nStatus\n\nDue to both the Israeli blockade and Hamas's authoritarian policies and actions, US political organization Freedom House ranks Gaza as \"not free\" [169]\n\nIsraeli occupation\nDespite the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, [20] the United Nations, international human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators consider the territory to be still occupied by Israel, supported by additional restrictions placed on Gaza by Egypt [185] [186] [187] Israel maintains direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza: it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, as well as six of Gaza's seven land crossings It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory Gaza is dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities [20] [188] The extensive Israeli buffer zone within the Strip renders much land off-limits to Gaza's inhabitants [189] The system of control imposed by Israel was described in the fall 2012 edition of International Security as an \"indirect occupation\" [190] The European Union (EU) considers Gaza to be occupied [191]\n\n\nCharacterization as open-air prison\nSeveral rights groups have characterized the situation in Gaza as an \"open-air prison\", [211] [23] including the United Nations, [212] Human Rights Watch, [213] and the Norwegian Refugee Council [214] This characterization was often cited by a number of human rights activists, politicians, and media news outlets reporting on the Gaza-Israel conflict and the wider Palestinian-Israeli conflict [215] [216] Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, [217] US Senator Bernie Sanders, [218] Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, [219] and Israeli historian Ilan Pappe have endorsed this characterization as well [220]\n\n\nStatehood\nSome Israeli analysts have argued that the Gaza Strip can be considered a de facto state, even if not internationally recognized as such Israeli Major General Giora Eiland, who headed Israel's National Security Council, has argued that after the disengagement and Hamas takeover, the Gaza Strip became a de facto state for all intents and purposes, writing that \"It has clear borders, an effective government, an independent foreign policy and an army These are the exact characteristics of a state.\" [221]\n\n\nControl over airspace\nAs agreed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the Oslo Accords, Israel has exclusive control over the airspace Contrarily to the Oslo Accords, however, Israel interferes with Gaza's radio and TV transmissions, and Israel prevents the Palestinians from operating a seaport or airport [86] The Accords permitted Palestinians to construct an airport, which was duly built and opened in 1998 Israel destroyed Gaza's only airport in 2001 and again in 2002, during the Second Intifada [227] [228]\n\n\nBuffer zone\nPart of the territory is depopulated because of the imposition of buffer zones on both the Israeli and Egyptian borders [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nGaza blockade\nIsrael and Egypt maintain a blockade of the Gaza Strip in response to security concerns, such as the smuggling of weapons into Gaza Israel has also stated that the blockade serves as \"economic warfare\" [33]  The Israeli human rights organization Gisha reports that the blockade undermines basic living conditions and human rights in Gaza [244] The Red Cross has reported that the blockade harms the economy and causes a shortage of basic medicines and equipment such as painkillers and x-ray film [245]\n\n\nMovement of people\nBecause of the Israeli–Egyptian blockade, the population is not free to leave or enter the Gaza Strip Only in exceptional cases are people allowed to pass through the Erez Crossing or the Rafah Border Crossing [237] [263] In 2015, a Gazan woman was not allowed to travel through Israel to Jordan on her way to her own wedding The Israeli authorities found she did not meet the criteria for travel, namely only in exceptional humanitarian cases [264]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring the course of the Israeli occupation, Gaza's economy has gone from a state of under-development with a deep dependency on Israel and strong ties to the West Bank, to a now isolated economy, deprived of the capacity to produce and innovate and subject to the damage of ongoing Israeli military attacks Gaza's economy is characterized by high levels of unemployment and impoverishment, with over 75% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid Political economist Sara Roy, the leading authority on the economy of the Gaza Strip, describes the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza as a turning point in Israeli policy, where previously Israel sought to control and dominate the economy of the Strip to serve its own interests, current policies seek to disable the economy, with the political goal of reducing the demands of the population for national, political and economic rights into a humanitarian problem [33]\n\n\nIsraeli policies following Israeli military occupation\nIn 1984, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Meron Benvenisti, described Israeli policy in the occupied territories as motivated primarily by the notion that Palestinian claims to economic and political rights are illegitimate He wrote that the economic policies stifle Palestinian economic development with the primary goal of prohibiting the establishment of a Palestinian state [279]\n\n\nIndustries\nGaza Strip industries are generally small family businesses that produce textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs The main agricultural products are olives, citrus, vegetables, Halal beef, and dairy products Primary exports are citrus and cut flowers, while primary imports are food, consumer goods, and construction materials The main trade partners of the Gaza Strip are Israel and Egypt [9]\n\n\nNatural resources\nNatural resources of Gaza include arable land—about a third of the Strip is irrigated Recently, natural gas was discovered The Gaza Strip is largely dependent on water from Wadi Gaza, which also supplies Israel [292] Most of water comes from groundwater wells (90% in 2021) Its quality is low and most of it is unfit for human consumption The remainder is produced by water desalination plants or bought from Israel's Mekorot (6% of all water in 2021) [293] According to Human Rights Watch, international humanitarian law requires Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, to ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population are provided for [294]\n\n\nSociety\nIn 2010, approximately 1.6 million people lived in the Gaza Strip, [9] almost 1.0 million of them were UN-registered refugees [297] The majority descend from refugees who were driven from or left their homes during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War The Strip's population has continued to increase since that time, mainly due to a total fertility rate which peaked at 8.3 children per woman in 1991 This fell to 4.4 children per woman in 2013 which was still among the highest worldwide [9] [298]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2010, approximately 1.6 million people lived in the Gaza Strip, [9] almost 1.0 million of them were UN-registered refugees [297] The majority descend from refugees who were driven from or left their homes during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War The Strip's population has continued to increase since that time, mainly due to a total fertility rate which peaked at 8.3 children per woman in 1991 This fell to 4.4 children per woman in 2013 which was still among the highest worldwide [9] [298]\n\n\nReligion\nSunni Muslims make up 99.8 percent of the population in the Gaza Strip, with an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 (0.2 percent) Arab Christians [299] [9]\n\n\nEducation\nPalestine had a reported 97% literacy rate (96% for females, 99% for males) in 2019 and youth literacy rate (ages 15–24) of 88% in 2020 (94% for females, 82% for males) [32] According to UNRWA figures, there are 640 schools in Gaza: 383 government schools, 221 UNRWA schools and 36 private schools, serving a total of 441,452 students [311]\n\n\nHealth\nIn Gaza, there are hospitals and additional healthcare facilities Because of the high number of young people the mortality rate is one of the lowest in the world, at 0.315% per year [316] The infant mortality rate is ranked 105th highest out of 224 countries and territories, at 16.55 deaths per 1,000 births [317] The Gaza Strip places 24th out of 135 countries according to Human Poverty Index According to the World Health Organization, in 2022 the average life expectancy for males was 72.5 years and 75 years for females, about the same as Egypt,

It is home to a population of over 1.6 million people, most of whom are refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Gaza Strip has a rich history, with archaeological evidence showing human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era. Today, it is a territory under a state of siege, with a poverty-stricken population living in one of the most densely populated areas in the world.\n\n## History\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been inhabited by various cultures throughout history, including the Philistines, who were the first to give the region its name. In the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and it remained under Ottoman rule until the early 20th century. In 1906, the Ottoman and British empires set the region's international border with Egypt. With the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, the British deferred the governance of the Gaza Strip area to Egypt, which declined the responsibility. Britain itself kept and ruled the territory it occupied in 1917-18, from 1920 until 1948 under the internationally accepted frame of \"Mandatory Palestine.\"\n\n### 1948-1959: All-Palestine government\n\nAfter the defeat of the Arab armies in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Gaza Strip was occupied by Transjordan and Egypt. In 1948, the Palestinian government, known as the All-Palestine Government, was established in Gaza. However, the government was unable to effectively govern the territory, and in 1959, the Egyptian government dissolved it.\n\n### 1956-1957: Israeli occupation\n\nDuring the 1956 Suez Crisis, Israel invaded Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. The Israeli military attacked Egyptian and Palestinian forces at Khan Yunis, and after a fierce battle, the Israeli 37th Armored Brigade broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade.\n\n### 1959-1967: Egyptian occupation\n\nAfter the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, Egypt continued to occupy Gaza until 1967. The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living. The Egyptian government restricted movement to and from Gaza, and its inhabitants could not look elsewhere for gainful employment.\n\n### 1967: Israeli occupation\n\nIn June 1967, during the Six-Day War, the Israeli military captured Gaza. Under the then-head of Israel's Southern Command, Ariel Sharon, dozens of Palestinians, suspected of being members of the resistance, were executed without trial.\n\n### 1987: First Intifada\n\nThe First Intifada was a sustained series of protests and violent riots carried out by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. It was motivated by collective Palestinian frustration over Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as it approached a twenty-year mark, having begun after Israel's victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.\n\n### 1994: Gaza under Palestinian Authority\n\nIn May 1994, following the Palestinian-Israeli agreements known as the Oslo Accords, a phased transfer of governmental authority to the Palestinians took place. Much of the Strip came under Palestinian control, except for the settlement blocs and military areas. The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas, leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas.\n\n### 2000: Second Intifada\n\nThe Second Intifada was a major Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. The general triggers for the unrest were centered on the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit, which was expected to reach a final agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\n### 2005: Israel's unilateral disengagement\n\nIn 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip and dismantled its settlements. However, Israel maintained control over Gaza's air and maritime space, as well as six of Gaza's seven land crossings.\n\n### 2006-2007: Hamas takeover\n\nIn the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Hamas won a plurality of 42.9% of the total vote and 74 out of 132 total seats. When Hamas assumed power, Israel, the United States, the EU, Russia, and the UN demanded that Hamas accept all previous agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist, and renounce violence.\n\n### 2007: Fatah-Hamas conflict\n\nFollowing the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Hamas and Fatah formed the Palestinian Authority national unity government headed by Ismail Haniyeh. However, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the Battle of Gaza, seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own.\n\n## Governance\n\nSince its takeover of Gaza, Hamas has exercised executive authority over the territory, and it governs the Strip through its own ad hoc executive, legislative, and judicial bodies. The Hamas government of 2012 was the second Palestinian Hamas-dominated government, ruling over the Gaza Strip, since the split of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007.\n\n## Security\n\nThe Gaza Strip's security is mainly handled by Hamas through its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, internal security service, and civil police force.\n\n## Economy\n\nGaza's economy has gone from a state of under-development with a deep dependency on Israel and strong ties to the West Bank to an isolated economy, deprived of the capacity to produce and innovate and subject to the damage of ongoing Israeli military attacks. The economy is characterized by high levels of unemployment and impoverishment, with over 75% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid.\n\n## Society\n\nIn 2010, approximately 1.6 million people lived in the Gaza Strip, almost 1.0 million of them were UN-registered refugees. The majority descend from refugees who were driven from or left their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Strip's population has continued to increase since that time, mainly due to a total fertility rate which peaked at 8.3 children per woman in 1991.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been home to a significant branch of the contemporary Palestinian art movement since the mid-20th century. Notable artists include painters Ismail Ashour, Shafiq Redwan, Bashir Senwar, Majed Shalla, Fayez Sersawi, Abdul Rahman al Muzayan, and Ismail Shammout.\n\n## Archaeology\n\nThe Gaza Museum of Archaeology was established by Jawdat N Khoudary in 2008.

\"Gaza_Strip\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nHistorically part of the Palestine region, the area was controlled since the 16th century by the Ottoman Empire; in 1906, the Ottomans and the British Empire set the region's international border with Egypt [36] With the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I and the subsequent partition of the Ottoman Empire, the British deferred the governance of the Gaza Strip area to Egypt, which declined the responsibility [37] Britain itself kept and ruled the territory it occupied in 1917–18, from 1920 until 1948 under the internationally accepted frame of \"Mandatory Palestine\".\n\n\n1948–1959: All-Palestine government\n\n\n1956–1957: Israeli occupation\nDuring the 1956 Suez Crisis (the Second Arab–Israeli war), Israel invaded Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula On 3 November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attacked Egyptian and Palestinian forces at Khan Yunis [42] The city of Khan Yunis resisted being captured, and Israel responded with a heavy bombing campaign that inflicted heavy civilian casualties [43] After a fierce battle, the Israeli 37th Armored Brigade's Sherman tanks broke through the heavily fortified lines outside of Khan Yunis held by the 86th Palestinian Brigade [44]\n\n\n1959–1967: Egyptian occupation\nAfter the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy Gaza until 1967 Egypt never annexed the Strip, but instead treated it as a controlled territory and administered it through a military governor [51] The influx of over 200,000 refugees from former Mandatory Palestine, roughly a quarter of those who fled or were expelled from their homes during, and in the aftermath of, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War into Gaza [52] resulted in a dramatic decrease in the standard of living Because the Egyptian government restricted movement to and from Gaza, its inhabitants could not look elsewhere for gainful employment [53]\n\n\n1967: Israeli occupation\nIn June 1967, during the Six-Day War, IDF captured Gaza Under the then head of Israel's Southern Command Ariel Sharon, dozens of Palestinians, suspected of being members of the resistance, were executed without trial [54]\n\n\n1987: First Intifada\nThe First Intifada was a sustained series of protests and violent riots carried out by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel [65] It was motivated by collective Palestinian frustration over Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as it approached a twenty-year mark, having begun after Israel's victory in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War [66] The uprising lasted from December 1987 until the Madrid Conference of 1991, though some date its conclusion to 1993, with the signing of the Oslo Accords.\n\n\n1994: Gaza under Palestinian Authority\nIn May 1994, following the Palestinian-Israeli agreements known as the Oslo Accords, a phased transfer of governmental authority to the Palestinians took place Much of the Strip came under Palestinian control, except for the settlement blocs and military areas The Israeli forces left Gaza City and other urban areas, leaving the new Palestinian Authority to administer and police those areas The Palestinian Authority, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza City as its first provincial headquarters In September 1995, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed a second agreement, extending the Palestinian Authority to most West Bank towns.\n\n\n2000: Second Intifada\nThe Second Intifada was a major Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories and Israel The general triggers for the unrest are speculated to have been centred on the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit, which was expected to reach a final agreement on the Israeli–Palestinian peace process in July 2000 [75] Outbreaks of violence began in September 2000, after Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli opposition leader, made a provocative visit to the Al-Aqsa compound on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; [75] the visit itself was peaceful, but, as anticipated, sparked protests and riots that Israeli police put down with rubber bullets and tear gas [76] The Second Intifada also marked the beginning of rocket attacks and bombings of Israeli border localities by Palestinian guerrillas from the Gaza Strip, especially by the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad movements.\n\n\n2005: Israel's unilateral disengagement\nIn 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip and dismantled its settlements [86] Israel also withdrew from the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip of land adjacent to the border with Egypt, after Egypt agreed to secure its side of the border after the Agreement on Movement and Access, known as the Rafah Agreement [87] The Gaza Strip was left under the control of the Palestinian Authority [88]\n\n\nPost-2006: Hamas takeover\nIn the Palestinian parliamentary elections held on 25 January 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 42.9% of the total vote and 74 out of 132 total seats (56%) [89] [90] When Hamas assumed power the next month, Israel, the United States, the EU, Russia and the UN demanded that Hamas accept all previous agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist, and renounce violence; when Hamas refused, [91] they cut off direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, although some aid money was redirected to humanitarian organizations not affiliated with the government [92] The resulting political disorder and economic stagnation led to many Palestinians emigrating from the Gaza Strip [93]\n\n\n2007: Fatah–Hamas conflict\nFollowing the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Hamas and Fatah formed the Palestinian authority national unity government headed by Ismail Haniyeh Shortly after, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the course of the Battle of Gaza (June 2007), [103] seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with its own [104] By 14 June, Hamas fully controlled the Gaza Strip Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responded by declaring a state of emergency, dissolving the unity government and forming a new government without Hamas participation PNA security forces in the West Bank arrested a number of Hamas members \n\n\nEgyptian border barrier breach\nOn 23 January 2008, after months of preparation during which the steel reinforcement of the border barrier was weakened, [109] Hamas destroyed several parts of the wall dividing Gaza and Egypt in the town of Rafah Hundreds of thousands of Gazans crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies Due to the crisis, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered his troops to allow the Palestinians in but to verify that they did not bring weapons back across the border [110] Egypt arrested and later released several armed Hamas militants in the Sinai who presumably wanted to infiltrate into Israel At the same time, Israel increased its state of alert along the length of the Israel–Egypt Sinai border, and warned its citizens to leave Sinai \"without delay.\"\n\n\n2008–2009: Gaza War\nOn 27 December 2008, [112] Israeli F-16 fighters launched a series of air strikes against targets in Gaza following the breakdown of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas [113] Israel began a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip on 3 January 2009 [114] Various sites that Israel claimed were being used as weapons depots were struck from the air : police stations, schools, hospitals, UN warehouses, mosques, various Hamas government buildings and other buildings [115]\n\n\n2014: Gaza War\nOn 5 June 2014, Fatah signed a unity agreement with the Hamas political party [128]\n\n\n2018–2019: Great March of Return\nIn 2018–2019, a series of protests, also known as the Great March of Return, were held each Friday in the Gaza Strip near the Israel–Gaza barrier from 30 March 2018 until 27 December 2019, during which a total of 223 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces [133] [134] The demonstrators demanded that the Palestinian refugees must be allowed to return to lands they were displaced from in what is now Israel They protested against Israel's land, air and sea blockade of the Gaza Strip and the United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel [135] [136] [137]\n\n\n2021: Israel–Palestine crisis\nBefore the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Gaza had 48% unemployment and half of the population lived in poverty During the crisis, 66 children died (551 children in the previous conflict) On 13 June 2021, a high level World Bank delegation visited Gaza to witness the damage Mobilization with UN and EU partners is ongoing to finalize a needs assessment in support of Gaza's reconstruction and recovery [146]\n\n\n2023–2024: Israel–Hamas war\nOn 7 October 2023, the paramilitaries in Gaza, led by the Hamas's Al-Qassam Brigades, invaded southwest Israel, targeting Israeli communities and military bases, killing at least 1,300 people and taking at least 236 hostages [149] On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and imposed a \"total blockade\" of the Gaza Strip, [150] with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declaring, \"There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\" [151] [152] Gallant changed his position after pressure from US President Joe Biden, and a deal was made on 19 October for Israel and Egypt to allow aid into Gaza [153] Gaza is currently undergoing a severe humanitarian crisis [154] By 13 November 2023, one out of every 200 people in Gaza were killed, becoming one out of every 100 by January 2024 [155] [156]\n\n\nGeography\nThe Gaza Strip is 41 km (25 mi) long, from 6 to 12 km (3.7 to 7.5 mi) wide, and has a total area of 365 km2 (141 sq mi) [27] [9] It has a 51 km (32 mi) border with Israel, and an 11 km (7 mi) border with Egypt, near the city of Rafah [163]\n\n\nClimate\nThe Gaza Strip has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh), with warm winters during which practically all the annual rainfall occurs, and dry, hot summers Despite the dryness, humidity is high throughout the year Annual rainfall is higher than in any part of Egypt at between 225 mm (9 in) in the south and 400 mm (16 in) in the north, but almost all of this falls between November and February.\n\n\nEnvironment issues\nEnvironmental problems in Gaza include desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources A United Nations official said in 2024 that \"it could take 14 years .. to clear debris, including rubble from destroyed buildings\" (of the Israel–Hamas war) [168]\n\n\nGovernance\nSince its takeover of Gaza, Hamas has exercised executive authority over the Gaza Strip, and it governs the territory through its own ad hoc executive, legislative, and judicial bodies [169] The Hamas government of 2012 was the second Palestinian Hamas-dominated government, ruling over the Gaza Strip, since the split of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007 It was announced in early September 2012 [170] The reshuffle of the previous government was approved by Gaza-based Hamas MPs from the Palestinian Legislative Council or parliament [170] Since the Hamas takeover in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been described as a \"de facto one-party state\", although it tolerates other political groups, including leftist ones such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [171] [15]\n\n\nHamas government\nSince its takeover of Gaza, Hamas has exercised executive authority over the Gaza Strip, and it governs the territory through its own ad hoc executive, legislative, and judicial bodies [169] The Hamas government of 2012 was the second Palestinian Hamas-dominated government, ruling over the Gaza Strip, since the split of the Palestinian National Authority in 2007 It was announced in early September 2012 [170] The reshuffle of the previous government was approved by Gaza-based Hamas MPs from the Palestinian Legislative Council or parliament [170] Since the Hamas takeover in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been described as a \"de facto one-party state\", although it tolerates other political groups, including leftist ones such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [171] [15]\n\n\nSecurity\nThe Gaza Strip's security is mainly handled by Hamas through its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, internal security service, and civil police force The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades have an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 operatives [174]\n\n\nOther groups and ideologies\nOther Palestinian militant factions operate in the Gaza Strip alongside, and sometimes opposed to Hamas The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, also known as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is the second largest militant faction operating in the Gaza Strip Its military wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, has an estimated 8,000 fighters [175] [176]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe enclave is divided into five governorates: the North Gaza Governorate, Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah Governorate, Khan Yunis Governorate and Rafah Governorate.\n\n\nLegality of Hamas rule\nAfter Hamas's June 2007 takeover, it ousted Fatah-linked officials from positions of power and authority (such as government positions, security services, universities, newspapers, etc.) and strove to enforce law by progressively removing guns from the hands of peripheral militias, clans, and criminal groups, and gaining control of supply tunnels According to Amnesty International, under Hamas rule, newspapers were closed down and journalists were harassed [179] Fatah demonstrations were forbidden or suppressed, as in the case of a large demonstration on the anniversary of Yasser Arafat's death, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, after protesters hurled stones at Hamas security forces [180]\n\n\nStatus\n\nDue to both the Israeli blockade and Hamas's authoritarian policies and actions, US political organization Freedom House ranks Gaza as \"not free\" [169]\n\nIsraeli occupation\nDespite the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, [20] the United Nations, international human rights organisations, and the majority of governments and legal commentators consider the territory to be still occupied by Israel, supported by additional restrictions placed on Gaza by Egypt [185] [186] [187] Israel maintains direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza: it controls Gaza's air and maritime space, as well as six of Gaza's seven land crossings It reserves the right to enter Gaza at will with its military and maintains a no-go buffer zone within the Gaza territory Gaza is dependent on Israel for water, electricity, telecommunications, and other utilities [20] [188] The extensive Israeli buffer zone within the Strip renders much land off-limits to Gaza's inhabitants [189] The system of control imposed by Israel was described in the fall 2012 edition of International Security as an \"indirect occupation\" [190] The European Union (EU) considers Gaza to be occupied [191]\n\n\nCharacterization as open-air prison\nSeveral rights groups have characterized the situation in Gaza as an \"open-air prison\", [211] [23] including the United Nations, [212] Human Rights Watch, [213] and the Norwegian Refugee Council [214] This characterization was often cited by a number of human rights activists, politicians, and media news outlets reporting on the Gaza-Israel conflict and the wider Palestinian-Israeli conflict [215] [216] Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, [217] US Senator Bernie Sanders, [218] Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, [219] and Israeli historian Ilan Pappe have endorsed this characterization as well [220]\n\n\nStatehood\nSome Israeli analysts have argued that the Gaza Strip can be considered a de facto state, even if not internationally recognized as such Israeli Major General Giora Eiland, who headed Israel's National Security Council, has argued that after the disengagement and Hamas takeover, the Gaza Strip became a de facto state for all intents and purposes, writing that \"It has clear borders, an effective government, an independent foreign policy and an army These are the exact characteristics of a state.\" [221]\n\n\nControl over airspace\nAs agreed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the Oslo Accords, Israel has exclusive control over the airspace Contrarily to the Oslo Accords, however, Israel interferes with Gaza's radio and TV transmissions, and Israel prevents the Palestinians from operating a seaport or airport [86] The Accords permitted Palestinians to construct an airport, which was duly built and opened in 1998 Israel destroyed Gaza's only airport in 2001 and again in 2002, during the Second Intifada [227] [228]\n\n\nBuffer zone\nPart of the territory is depopulated because of the imposition of buffer zones on both the Israeli and Egyptian borders [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nGaza blockade\nIsrael and Egypt maintain a blockade of the Gaza Strip in response to security concerns, such as the smuggling of weapons into Gaza Israel has also stated that the blockade serves as \"economic warfare\" [33]  The Israeli human rights organization Gisha reports that the blockade undermines basic living conditions and human rights in Gaza [244] The Red Cross has reported that the blockade harms the economy and causes a shortage of basic medicines and equipment such as painkillers and x-ray film [245]\n\n\nMovement of people\nBecause of the Israeli–Egyptian blockade, the population is not free to leave or enter the Gaza Strip Only in exceptional cases are people allowed to pass through the Erez Crossing or the Rafah Border Crossing [237] [263] In 2015, a Gazan woman was not allowed to travel through Israel to Jordan on her way to her own wedding The Israeli authorities found she did not meet the criteria for travel, namely only in exceptional humanitarian cases [264]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring the course of the Israeli occupation, Gaza's economy has gone from a state of under-development with a deep dependency on Israel and strong ties to the West Bank, to a now isolated economy, deprived of the capacity to produce and innovate and subject to the damage of ongoing Israeli military attacks Gaza's economy is characterized by high levels of unemployment and impoverishment, with over 75% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid Political economist Sara Roy, the leading authority on the economy of the Gaza Strip, describes the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza as a turning point in Israeli policy, where previously Israel sought to control and dominate the economy of the Strip to serve its own interests, current policies seek to disable the economy, with the political goal of reducing the demands of the population for national, political and economic rights into a humanitarian problem [33]\n\n\nIsraeli policies following Israeli military occupation\nIn 1984, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Meron Benvenisti, described Israeli policy in the occupied territories as motivated primarily by the notion that Palestinian claims to economic and political rights are illegitimate He wrote that the economic policies stifle Palestinian economic development with the primary goal of prohibiting the establishment of a Palestinian state [279]\n\n\nIndustries\nGaza Strip industries are generally small family businesses that produce textiles, soap, olive-wood carvings, and mother-of-pearl souvenirs The main agricultural products are olives, citrus, vegetables, Halal beef, and dairy products Primary exports are citrus and cut flowers, while primary imports are food, consumer goods, and construction materials The main trade partners of the Gaza Strip are Israel and Egypt [9]\n\n\nNatural resources\nNatural resources of Gaza include arable land—about a third of the Strip is irrigated Recently, natural gas was discovered The Gaza Strip is largely dependent on water from Wadi Gaza, which also supplies Israel [292] Most of water comes from groundwater wells (90% in 2021) Its quality is low and most of it is unfit for human consumption The remainder is produced by water desalination plants or bought from Israel's Mekorot (6% of all water in 2021) [293] According to Human Rights Watch, international humanitarian law requires Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, to ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population are provided for [294]\n\n\nSociety\nIn 2010, approximately 1.6 million people lived in the Gaza Strip, [9] almost 1.0 million of them were UN-registered refugees [297] The majority descend from refugees who were driven from or left their homes during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War The Strip's population has continued to increase since that time, mainly due to a total fertility rate which peaked at 8.3 children per woman in 1991 This fell to 4.4 children per woman in 2013 which was still among the highest worldwide [9]

total of 441,452 students [311]\n\n\nHealth\nIn Gaza, there are hospitals and additional healthcare facilities Because of the high number of young people the mortality rate is one of the lowest in the world, at 0.315% per year [316] The infant mortality rate is ranked 105th highest out of 224 countries and territories, at 16.55 deaths per 1,000 births [317] The Gaza Strip places 24th out of 135 countries according to Human Poverty Index According to the World Health Organization, in 2022 the average life expectancy for males was 72.5 years and 75 years for females, about the same as Egypt, Lebanon or Jordan, but lower than in Israel [318]\n\n\nCulture and sports\nThe Gaza Strip has been home to a significant branch of the contemporary Palestinian art movement since the mid-20th century

Kyriakopoulou was trained as a soprano [13] Vangelis had one brother, Nikos Vangelis recalled a peaceful and happy childhood without interference from his parents, who let him be involved in his activities, mainly consisting of playing the piano, painting, and constructing things with his hands [14]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter the Forminx split, Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound as a composer and producer [21] He wrote the score to several Greek films–My Brother, the Traffic Policeman (1963), 5,000 Lies (1966) by Giorgos Konstantinou, Antique Rally (1966), Frenzy (1966), To Prosopo tis Medousas (1967) by Nikos Koundouros, and Apollo Goes on Holiday (1968) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]\n\n\n1963–1974: Early solo projects and Aphrodite's Child\nAfter the Forminx split, Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound as a composer and producer [21] He wrote the score to several Greek films–My Brother, the Traffic Policeman (1963), 5,000 Lies (1966) by Giorgos Konstantinou, Antique Rally (1966), Frenzy (1966), To Prosopo tis Medousas (1967) by Nikos Koundouros, and Apollo Goes on Holiday (1968) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]\n\n\n1974–1980: Move to London, solo breakthrough, and Jon and Vangelis\nBy the end of 1974 Vangelis was able to relocate to England, by which time he felt he \"outgrew France\" musically [40] He settled in a flat on Queen's Gate, London and set up a 16-track recording facility named Nemo Studios on Hampden Gurney Street in Marble Arch, which he named his \"laboratory\" [11] [41] In August 1975, he signed a four-album deal with RCA Records, for which he released a series of influential electronic-based albums that increased his profile [40] The first of these was Heaven and Hell (1975), a concept album based on duality that features Anderson singing lead vocals on \"So Long Ago, So Clear\" and the English Chamber Choir [42] The album went to No 31 in the UK, and was performed live in concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1976 [43] The album was followed by the UK top 20 Albedo 0.39 (1976), Spiral (1977), and the spontaneous Beaubourg (1978), each having their own thematic inspiration including astronomy and physical cosmology, Tao philosophy, and Vangelis' visit to the Centre Georges Pompidou, respectively [43] [44]\n\n\n1981–2002: Mainstream success\nVangelis composed and performed on the soundtrack for Chariots of Fire (1981), a historical drama film directed by Hugh Hudson He accepted the job because \"I liked the people I was working with It was a very humble, low-budget film.\" [35] The choice of music was unorthodox as most period films featured orchestral scores, whereas Vangelis's music was modern and synthesiser-oriented Released in 1981, it gained mainstream commercial success which increased Vangelis's profile as a result [35] The opening instrumental piece, \"Titles\", later named \"Chariots of Fire – Titles\", was released as a single and spent one week at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 after a five-month climb [56] The soundtrack album was No 1 on the Billboard 200 for four weeks and sold one million copies in the US In March 1982, Vangelis won an Academy Award for Best Original Music Score, but refused to attend the awards ceremony, [35] partly due to his fear of flying He turned down an offer to stay in a stateroom aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 for a boat crossing [57] Vangelis commented that the \"main inspiration was the story itself The rest I did instinctively, without thinking about anything else, other than to express my feelings with the technological means available to me at the time\" [58] The song was used at the 1984 Winter Olympics [5] and it was described as the work for which Vangelis was best known [59]\n\n\nFilm and television\nVangelis composed and performed on the soundtrack for Chariots of Fire (1981), a historical drama film directed by Hugh Hudson He accepted the job because \"I liked the people I was working with It was a very humble, low-budget film.\" [35] The choice of music was unorthodox as most period films featured orchestral scores, whereas Vangelis's music was modern and synthesiser-oriented Released in 1981, it

known [59]\n\n\nTheatre and stage productions\nIn the early 1980s Vangelis began composing for ballet and theatre stage plays [51] In 1983 he wrote the music for Michael Cacoyannis' staging of the Greek tragedy Elektra which was performed with Irene Papas at the open-air amphitheater at Epidavros in Greece [35] The same year Vangelis composed his first ballet score, for a production by Wayne Eagling It was originally performed by Lesley Collier and Eagling himself at an Amnesty International gala at the Drury Lane theatre [51] In 1984 the Royal Ballet School presented it again at the Sadler's Wells theatre In 1985 and 1986, Vangelis wrote music for two more ballets: \"Frankenstein – Modern Prometheus\" [46] and \"The Beauty and the Beast\" [48] In 1992, Vangelis wrote the music for a restaging of the Euripides play Medea, that featured Irene Papas [52] [68] In 2001 he composed for a third play which starred Papas, and for \na version of William Shakespeare's The Tempest staged by Hungarian director György Schwajdas [69]\n\n\nSolo albums and collaborations\nIn 1974 Vangelis collaborated with Italian singer Claudio Baglioni in the album E tu... [70] The album reached first place in the Italian sales charts and was the sixth best-selling album in Italy in 1974 [71]\n\n\nSporting events\nThe Sport Aid (1986) TV broadcast was set to music specially composed by Vangelis [46] He conceived and staged the ceremony of the 1997 World Championships in Athletics which were held in Greece He also composed the music, and designed and directed the artistic Olympic flag relay portion (\"Handover to Athens\"), of the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney [77] While no official recording of this composition exists, the music can be heard accompanying the presentation of the emblem of the 2004 Athens Games In 2002, Vangelis created the official Anthem for the 2002 FIFA World Cup [78] His work from Chariots of Fire was heard during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony [79] His work Conquest of Paradise (1992) (from the movie 1492: Conquest of Paradise) is now the theme song of famous Trail Running competition Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc [citation needed]\n\n\n2001–2021: Music projects with NASA and ESA\nIn 2001, Vangelis performed live, and subsequently released, the choral symphony Mythodea, which was used by NASA as the theme for the Mars Odyssey mission This is a predominantly orchestral rather than electronic piece that was originally written in 1993 [80] In 2004, Vangelis released the score for Oliver Stone's Alexander, continuing his involvement with projects related to Greece [5] [81]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nFor a musician of his stature, very little is known about Vangelis' personal life; and he rarely gave interviews to journalists [35] [96]\nIn 2005, he stated that he was \"never interested\" in the \"decadent lifestyle\" of his band days, choosing not to use alcohol or other drugs [5] He also had little interest in the music industry business and achieving stardom, realising \"that success and pure creativity are not very compatible The more successful you become, the more you become a product of something that generates money\" [9] [57] [58] Instead, he used it to be as free and independent as possible and often rejected the opportunity to promote or capitalise on his fame [57]\n\n\nMusical style and sensibility\nThe musical style of Vangelis is diverse; although he primarily used electronic music instruments, which characterize electronic music, his music has been described as a mixture of electronica, [119] classical (his music was often symphonic), progressive rock, [120] jazz (improvisations), [35] ambient, [120] [121] avant-garde/experimental, [120] [122] and world [35] [123] Vangelis is sometimes categorized as a new-age composer, [122] a classification others have disputed Vangelis himself called New-age music a style which \"gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music\" [5]\n\n\nInstruments and equipment\nAs a musician who always composed and played primarily on keyboards, Vangelis relied heavily on synthesizers [131] and other electronic approaches to music, although his first instrument was the piano He also played and used many acoustic and folk instruments when required  [1]) and was a keen percussionist (in addition to a standard drum kit, he performed on vibraphone, timpani, symphonic gongs and snare drums, various gamelan instruments, a tubular bell, a wind gong, a bell tree, and crotales) On several of his albums, he employed a live choir and classical soprano (usually Vana Veroutis) \n\n\nHonours and legacy\nIn 1989 Vangelis received the Max Steiner Award [65] France made him a Knight of the Order of the Arts and Letters in 1992 and promoted him to Commander in 2017, [136] as well as Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour in 2001 [137] In 1993 he received the music award Apollo by Friends of the Athens National Opera Society [65] In 1995, Vangelis had a minor planet named after him (6354 Vangelis) by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC) at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; the name was proposed by the MPC's co-director, Gareth V Williams, rather than by the object's original discoverer, Eugène Joseph Delporte, who died in 1955, long before the 1934 discovery could be confirmed by observations made in 1990 In 1996 and 1997, Vangelis received awards at the World Music Awards [65]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nSoundtracks\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Breakker into the exposed turnbuckle pad and performed a Superkick to retain the title [23]\n\n\nReception\nJohn Moore of Pro Wrestling Dot Net called the NXT Title match \"a really good WWE main roster style PPV main event\", giving praise to Breakker and Ziggler's performances, felt the North American Title Ladder bout was a \"good opening high spot match\" that got viewers invested in the show, saw Gunther/LA Knight as formulaic but \"a fun formula to watch\", and critiqued that the NXT Women's Title Fatal four-way had rough elements whenever Rose and Jade interacted with each other He concluded by saying \"this was not an NXT Takeover by any means The closest match to the usual NXT style was the opening ladder match, and you see those on main roster PPVs too The amount of strange booking and plot convenience made this feel main rostery, which is not great when it comes off as inferior with all the green talent So when it comes to judging this on the Takeover curve, this doesn't even make the mark\" [23] Matthew McFarlin of Slam Wrestling reviewed the event and gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars He wrote that: \"The North American Championship ladder match was impossible to follow, and the remainder of the card suffered because of it While the opener had exciting, well-executed chaos, some matches were just messy and unengaging Ziggler and Breakker put on a solid main event, but it wasn't enough to make Stand & Deliver worthwhile\" [25]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn the April 4 episode of Raw, Bron Breakker got his rematch against Dolph Ziggler and defeated him to win the NXT Championship for a second time, which was the third time the title was defended on Raw, as well as the first time the title changed hands on Raw [26] At NXT the next day, Breakker talked about his win

roster style PPV main event\", giving praise to Breakker and Ziggler's performances, felt the North American Title Ladder bout was a \"good opening high spot match\" that got viewers invested in the show, saw Gunther/LA Knight as formulaic but \"a fun formula to watch\", and critiqued that the NXT Women's Title Fatal four-way had rough elements whenever Rose and Jade interacted with each other He concluded by saying \"this was not an NXT Takeover by any means The closest match to the usual NXT style was the opening ladder match, and you see those on main roster PPVs too The amount of strange booking and plot convenience made this feel main rostery, which is not great when it comes off as inferior with all the green talent So when it comes to judging this on the Takeover curve, this doesn't even make the mark\" [23] Matthew McFarlin of Slam Wrestling reviewed the event and gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars He wrote that: \"The North American Championship ladder match was impossible to follow, and the remainder of the card suffered because of it While the opener had exciting, well-executed chaos, some matches were just messy and unengaging Ziggler and Breakker put on a solid main event, but it wasn't enough to make Stand & Deliver worthwhile\" [25]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn the April 4 episode of Raw, Bron Breakker got his rematch against Dolph Ziggler and defeated him to win the NXT Championship for a second time, which was the third time the title was defended on Raw, as well as the first time the title changed hands on Raw [26] At NXT the next day, Breakker talked about his win

on as a substitute for Guido Carrillo for the last 26 minutes, and scored his first goal four days later in a 1–0 Copa del Rey home win against Real Madrid [25]\n\n\nBarcelona\nOn 20 February 2020, Barcelona triggered Braithwaite's release clause of €18 million and signed him on a four-and-a-half-year contract His release clause was set to €300 million [28] Barcelona were granted an emergency

September, he scored a goal on his debut in a 1–0 away victory over Athletic Bilbao [40] Following the club's relegation in the 2022–23 season, Braithwaite left the club's preseason camp in Marbella without any notice due to his wishes of not playing in the Segunda División and possibly considering retirement [41] [42] In discussion of disciplinary action, Espanyol offered the forward to Osasuna with a potential exchange for Kike García [43] Braithwaite's representatives put in offers towards Ligue 1 clubs with Lens and Metz having their offers rejected for not meeting their terms [44] He eventually remained at the club, scoring 22 goals in the 2023–24 season, as top scorer of the second division [45] He left Espanyol on 15 July 2024 after executing a contract clause to terminate his contract unilaterally.\n\n\nGrêmio\nOn 22 July 2024, Grêmio reached an agreement to sign Braithwaite He arrived in Porto Alegre shortly after where he passed his medical examinations and signed a contract [46] There, he was seen as Luis Suárez' replacement [47] He made his debut on 11 August in a memorable match During a 3–1 away victory against Cuiabá, he scored both an own goal and a brace, playing a crucial role in Grêmio's win [48] [49]\n\n\nInternational career\nHaving already represented several Danish national youth teams, in the summer of 2012, Braithwaite was offered the chance to

{"title": "FA_Cup", "content": "\nHistory\nIn 1863, the newly founded Football Association (the FA) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then On 20 July 1871, in the offices of The Sportsman newspaper, the FA Secretary C W Alcock proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\" The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871 After thirteen games in all, Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872 Wanderers retained the trophy the following year The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888–89 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced [3]\n\n\nEligibility\nAn application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July All clubs in the top four levels (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible Clubs from Level 5–9 (non-league football) are also eligible provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and The Association may reject applications at its discretion [2]\n\n\nCompetition format\nBeginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May A system of byes ensures clubs above Level 9 enter the competition at later stages There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw Prior to the fifth round, fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024–25 campaign, this will be prior to the first round proper) [21] [22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.\n\n\nOverview\nBeginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May A system of byes ensures clubs above Level 9 enter the competition at later stages There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw Prior to the fifth round, fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024–25 campaign, this will be prior to the first round proper) [21] [22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.\n\n\nSchedule\nAll entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the extra preliminary round, as well as any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy [2] Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or preliminary round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition [2] From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below.\n\n\nDraws\nThe draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and first qualifying rounds used to all occur at the same time Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance.\n\n\nTiebreaking\nIn rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a replay, played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout Since 2016–17, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties From 2018–19, Fifth round ties are also settled by extra time and penalties Beginning with the 2024–25 competition, replays have been scrapped from the first round onwards [28] The decision to scrap replays received criticism from a number of lower-tier clubs and government officials [29]\n\n\nQualification for subsequent competitions\nThe FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead) This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead) FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage [35] From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition [36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition.\n\n\nEuropean football\nThe FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead) This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead) FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage [35] From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition [36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition.\n\n\nFA Community Shield\nThe FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league – the double).\n\n\nVenues\nFixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue – the rebuilt Wembley Stadium.\n\n\nCompetition rounds\nIn the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn – simply the first team drawn out for each fixture Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams However, since 2003, clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot [37] In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home.\n\n\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007) For the first decade of the competition, the Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times) The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.\n\n\nFinal\nThe possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup [79] Almost every club in the League Pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history [80] It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top Premier League team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e from outside The Football League.\n\n\nArtificial turf\nThe FA permitted artificial turf (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014–15 edition and beyond [42] Under the 2015–16 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs [2] This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only – if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch [43] Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium on 20 November 2014 [44]\n\n\nTrophy\nThe winners of the competition receive the FA Cup It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015–16) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice [2] Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals [45]\n\n\nOriginal design from 1871\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of £20 [54] It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by Aston Villa on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again Despite a £10 reward for information, the crime was never solved As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa £25 to pay for a replacement.\n\n\n1871 original\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of £20 [54] It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop

was in their care, the FA fined Villa £25 to pay for a replacement.\n\n\n1895 replica\nAfter the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911 The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird [46] Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005 [56] It was sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 (£478,400 including auction fees and taxes) [46] The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997 [47] The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation [47] Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display [56] It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester [46] In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final In September 2020, Gold sold the replica trophy for £760,000 through the Bonhams auction house [57] In January 2021, it was revealed that the trophy had been purchased by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, who stated that it would be returned on loan to the National Football Museum [58]\n\n\nCurrent design from 1911\nThe redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5 cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by Fattorini & Sons of Bradford, coincidentally being won by Bradford City in its first outing [45] [46]\n\n\n1911 original\nThe redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5 cm (24.2 inches) high, and was

Spencer [60] A copy of this trophy was also produced, in case anything happened to the primary trophy [61]\n\n\n2014 replica\nThe 2014 replica was made by Thomas Lyte, handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to 6.3 kilograms (14 lb) [45]\n\n\nMedals\nEach club in the final receives 40 winners or runners-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials The traditional styles of gold-cased medals – the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946 – were replaced for the 2021 final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon [62]\n\n\nSponsorship\nSince the start of the 1994–95 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name Sponsorship deals run for four years, though – as in the case of E.ON – one-year extensions may be agreed Emirates Airline has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser' [63] The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended for three times until 2021, 2024, 2028 [64]\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nThe

the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e from outside The Football League.\n\n\nEarly years\nThe Football League was founded in 1888, 16 years after the first FA Cup competition Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the Football Alliance, two years before that competition merged with the Football League [81] Later, with the Football League predominantly in the North and Midlands of England, leading clubs of the Southern Football League were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-League side to win the Cup, [82] while fellow Southern League team Southampton were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902 In 1920–21, the Football League expanded to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a further division consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the English football league system competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear underdogs.\n\n\nNon-League giant killings\nSince the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was National League side Lincoln City's run to the quarter-finals of the 2016–17 FA Cup, during which they defeated Championship side Brighton 3–1 in the fourth round and Premier League side Burnley 1–0 in the fifth, before falling to ultimate Cup champions Arsenal 5–0 at the Emirates Lincoln's defeat of Burnley was only the third (and most recent) FA Cup victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side since 1989 [83] Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure Liverpool, having already won five league titles in their history, were in the Second Division in 1959 when they lost 2–1 to Worcester City of the Southern League [84]\n\n\nNon-League cup runs\nFor non-League teams, reaching the third round proper – where all Level 1 sides now enter – is considered a major achievement In the 2008–09 FA Cup, a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat [88] As of the 2023–24 season, only eleven non-League teams have reached the fifth round proper (last 16) since 1925, [89] and only Lincoln City have progressed to the quarter-finals (last 8), during the 2016–17 edition of the tournament [90]\n\n\nGiant killings between League clubs\nGiant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the 1992 victory by Wrexham, bottom of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of The Football League), over reigning champions Arsenal Another similar shock was when Shrewsbury Town beat Everton 2–1 in 2003 Everton finished seventh in the Premier League and Shrewsbury Town were relegated to the Football Conference that same season.\n\n\nWinners and finalists\nSince its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 clubs Teams shown in italics are no longer in existence Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887 [96]\n\n\nResults by team\nSince its establishment, the FA Cup has been won by 44 clubs Teams shown in italics are no longer in existence Additionally, Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887 [96]\n\n\nConsecutive winners\nFour clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: Wanderers (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), Blackburn Rovers (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), Tottenham Hotspur (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and Arsenal (2002, 2003 and 2014, 2015).\n\n\nWinning managers\nThe record for most titles for a manager is held by Arsène Wenger, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, 2017) Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium.\n\n\nDoubles/Trebles\nManchester City (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup, having beaten Chelsea 4–3 on penalties in the League Cup Final, finished at the top of the Premier League, and beaten Watford 6–0 in the FA Cup Final.\n\n\nOutside England\nThe FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once Cardiff City achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley They had previously made it to the final only to lose to Sheffield United in 1925 and lost another final to Portsmouth in 2008 Cardiff City are also the only team to win the national cups of two countries in the same season, having also won the Welsh Cup in 1927 The Scottish team Queen's Park reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885.\n\n\nOutside the top division\nSince the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980) With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) – Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902, then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe FA Cup Final is one of 10 events

shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland Scottish member STV refused to show them, and instead the regularly advertised programming that otherwise would mostly have been shown across the UK (new and repeated network entertainment and drama content, films, local productions etc.) would continue as normal in a delayed or exclusive fashion while the rest of the ITV network aired the football ITV showed 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live The final was also shown live on ITV Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final The channel also broadcast ITV's matches, albeit with their own commentary teams, exclusively to Scotland, after STV's decision to replace the games with regular programming Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals [101]\n\n\n2009 to 2010\nAs a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time Many [who?] expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final.\n\n\n2010 to 2014\nESPN bought the competition for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.\n\n\n2014 to 2019\nITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the 2014–15 FA Cup, terrestrial rights returned to BBC Sport, with the final being shown on BBC One while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round [109]\n\n\n2019 onwards\nOn 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace BT Sport in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021–22 season, this new deal will see BBC and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1988, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on free-to-air television [112]\n\n\nOverseas broadcasters\nThe FA sells overseas rights separately from the domestic contract [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# FA Cup\n\n## History\n\nThe Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout association football competition in England, and is the oldest association football competition in the world. The tournament is run by The Football Association (FA), and the winner receives a trophy and qualification for the UEFA Europa League. The competition was first held in the 1871-72 season, and the first final was played on March 16, 1872, between Wanderers and Royal Engineers, with Wanderers winning 1-0.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nTo be eligible to enter the FA Cup, a club must be a member of the FA, and be a part of the English football league system. The top four levels of the English football league system (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible to enter the competition. Clubs from Level 5-9 (non-league football) are also eligible, provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season. All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition, and The Association may reject applications at its discretion.\n\n## Competition Format\n\nThe FA Cup is a knockout tournament, with the competition proceeding as follows:\n\n* The competition begins in August, with the extra preliminary round featuring teams from Level 9.\n* The competition proceeds through the preliminary and first qualifying rounds, with teams from higher levels entering at later stages.\n* The competition then enters the proper rounds, with all teams competing in the same draw.\n* The competition features a total of 12 rounds, including the final.\n* The winners of each match progress to the next round, with the losers being eliminated from the competition.\n\n## Schedule\n\nThe schedule for the FA Cup is as follows:\n\n* The extra preliminary round typically takes place in mid-August, with the preliminary and first qualifying rounds following in late August and early September.\n* The second and third qualifying rounds typically take place in September, with the fourth qualifying round following in mid-October.\n* The first round proper typically takes place in early November, with the second round proper following in mid-November.\n* The third round proper typically takes place in late December, with the fourth round proper following in early January.\n* The quarter-finals typically take place in mid-March, with the semi-finals following in late March.\n* The final typically takes place in late May.\n\n## Draws\n\nThe draws for the FA Cup are typically made as follows:\n\n* The draws for the extra preliminary, preliminary, and first qualifying rounds are made simultaneously.\n* The draws for each subsequent round are made after the scheduled dates for the previous round.\n* In the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance.\n\n## Tiebreaking\n\nIn rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw are replayed once only, with the replay taking place at the venue of the away team. If the replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout. From the 2016-17 season, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties.\n\n## Qualification for Subsequent Competitions\n\nThe winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the following season's UEFA Europa League. If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European competition through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists are given the European berth of the League Cup winners, and the League Cup winners are given the league berth instead.\n\n## FA Community Shield\n\nThe winner of the FA Cup also qualifies for the FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league).\n\n## Venues\n\nFixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams. The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue, typically Wembley Stadium.\n\n## Competition Rounds\n\nThe FA Cup features a total of 12 rounds, including the final. The rounds are as follows:\n\n* Extra Preliminary Round: The first round of the competition, featuring teams from Level 9.\n* Preliminary Round: The second round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 8 and 9.\n* First Qualifying Round: The third round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 7 and 8.\n* Second Qualifying Round: The fourth round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 6 and 7.\n* Third Qualifying Round: The fifth round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 5 and 6.\n* Fourth Qualifying Round: The sixth round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 4 and 5.\n* First Round Proper: The seventh round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 3 and 4.\n* Second Round Proper: The eighth round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 2 and 3.\n* Third Round Proper: The ninth round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 1 and 2.\n* Fourth Round Proper: The tenth round of the competition, featuring teams from Levels 1 and 2.\n* Quarter-Finals: The eleventh round of the competition, featuring the top 8 teams remaining.\n* Semi-Finals: The twelfth round of the competition, featuring the top 4 teams remaining.\n* Final: The thirteenth round of the competition, featuring the top 2 teams remaining.\n\n## Media Coverage\n\nThe FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FA_Cup\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1863, the newly founded Football Association (the FA) published the Laws of the Game of Association Football, unifying the various different rules in use before then On 20 July 1871, in the offices of The Sportsman newspaper, the FA Secretary C W Alcock proposed to the FA committee that \"it is desirable that a Challenge Cup should be established in connection with the Association for which all clubs belonging to the Association should be invited to compete\" The inaugural FA Cup tournament kicked off in November 1871 After thirteen games in all, Wanderers were crowned the winners in the final, on 16 March 1872 Wanderers retained the trophy the following year The modern cup was beginning to be established by the 1888–89 season, when qualifying rounds were introduced [3]\n\n\nEligibility\nAn application window is open to clubs before entry lists, round byes and scheduling are announced in July All clubs in the top four levels (the Premier League and the three divisions of the English Football League) are automatically eligible Clubs from Level 5–9 (non-league football) are also eligible provided they play in either the FA Trophy or FA Vase competitions in the current season All participating clubs must also have a stadium suitable for the competition and The Association may reject applications at its discretion [2]\n\n\nCompetition format\nBeginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May A system of byes ensures clubs above Level 9 enter the competition at later stages There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw Prior to the fifth round, fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024–25 campaign, this will be prior to the first round proper) [21] [22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.\n\n\nOverview\nBeginning in August, the competition proceeds as a knockout tournament throughout, consisting of twelve rounds, a semi-final and then a final, in May A system of byes ensures clubs above Level 9 enter the competition at later stages There is no seeding, the fixtures in each round being determined by a random draw Prior to the fifth round, fixtures ending in a tie are replayed once only (from the 2024–25 campaign, this will be prior to the first round proper) [21] [22] The first six rounds are qualifiers, with the draws organised on a regional basis The next six rounds are the \"proper\" rounds where all clubs are in one draw.\n\n\nSchedule\nAll entrants from Level 9 begin the competition in the extra preliminary round, as well as any Level 10 team filling in for a vacancy [2] Teams from Level 8 are ranked on their PPG in the previous season, except newly promoted teams automatically ranked towards the bottom and newly relegated teams ranked to the top; teams are then split between entering at either the Extra-Preliminary or preliminary round so as to ensure the right balance of fixtures throughout the competition [2] From there, clubs from higher levels are added in later rounds, as per the table below.\n\n\nDraws\nThe draws for the Extra Preliminary, Preliminary, and first qualifying rounds used to all occur at the same time Thereafter, the draw for each subsequent round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round, meaning that in the case of replays, clubs will often know their future opponents in advance.\n\n\nTiebreaking\nIn rounds up to and including the fourth round proper, fixtures resulting in a draw (after normal time) go to a replay, played at the venue of the away team, at a later date; if that replay is still tied, the winner is settled by a period of extra time, and if still necessary, a penalty shootout Since 2016–17, ties have been settled on the day from the quarter-finals onwards, using extra time and penalties From 2018–19, Fifth round ties are also settled by extra time and penalties Beginning with the 2024–25 competition, replays have been scrapped from the first round onwards [28] The decision to scrap replays received criticism from a number of lower-tier clubs and government officials [29]\n\n\nQualification for subsequent competitions\nThe FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead) This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners' Cup instead) FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage Losing finalists, if they had not qualified for Europe via the league, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage [35] From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition [36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition.\n\n\nEuropean football\nThe FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; from its launch in 1960 until 1998, they entered the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup instead) This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league or European performance, then the losing FA Cup finalists were given the European berth of the League Cup winners and the League Cup winners would be given the league berth instead (in the Cup Winners' Cup era, teams qualifying for the UEFA Cup via other competitions would be promoted to the Cup Winners'

stage [35] From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA does not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition [36] If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European Competition through their Premier League position, the FA Cup berth is then given to the highest placed team in the Premier League who has not yet qualified for a European Competition.\n\n\nFA Community Shield\nThe FA Cup winners also qualify for the following season's single-match FA Community Shield, the traditional season opener played against the previous season's Premier League champions (or the Premier League runners-up if the FA Cup winners also won the league – the double).\n\n\nVenues\nFixtures in the 12 rounds of the competition are usually played at the home ground of one of the two teams The semi-finals and final are played at a neutral venue – the rebuilt Wembley Stadium.\n\n\nCompetition rounds\nIn the matches for the 12 competition rounds, the team who plays at home is decided when the fixtures are drawn – simply the first team drawn out for each fixture Occasionally games may have to be moved to other grounds due to other events taking place, security reasons or a ground not being suitable to host popular teams However, since 2003, clubs cannot move grounds to the away side's for capacity or financial reasons If any move has to be made, it has to be to a neutral venue and any additional monies earned by the move goes into the central pot [37] In the event of a draw, the replay is played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home.\n\n\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-finals have been played exclusively at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium since 2008, one year after it opened and after it had already hosted a final (in 2007) For the first decade of the competition, the Kennington Oval was used as the semi-final venue In the period between this first decade and the reopening of Wembley, semi-finals were played at high-capacity neutral venues around England; usually the home grounds of teams not involved in that semi-final, chosen to be roughly equidistant between the two teams for fairness of travel The top three most used venues in this period were Villa Park in Birmingham (55 times), Hillsborough in Sheffield (34 times) and Old Trafford in Manchester (23 times) The original Wembley Stadium was also used seven times for semi-final, between 1991 and 2000 (the last held there), but not always for fixtures featuring London teams In 2005, both were held at the Millennium Stadium.\n\n\nFinal\nThe possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as a \"giant killing\", is much anticipated by the public Such upsets are considered an integral part of the tradition and prestige of the competition, and the attention gained by giant-killing teams can be as great as that for winners of the cup [79] Almost every club in the League Pyramid has a fondly remembered giant-killing act in its history [80] It is considered particularly newsworthy when a top Premier League team suffers an upset defeat, or where the giant-killer is a non-league club, i.e from outside The Football League.\n\n\nArtificial turf\nThe FA permitted artificial turf (3G) pitches in all rounds of the competition from the 2014–15 edition and beyond [42] Under the 2015–16 rules, the pitch must be of FIFA One Star quality, or Two Star for ties if they involve one of the 92 professional clubs [2] This followed approval two years previously for their use in the qualifying rounds only – if a team with a 3G pitch progressed to the competition proper, they had to switch their tie to the ground of another eligible entrant with a natural grass pitch [43] Having been strong proponents of the surface, the first match in the proper rounds to be played on a 3G surface was a televised first round replay at Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium on 20 November 2014 [44]\n\n\nTrophy\nThe winners of the competition receive the FA Cup It is only loaned to the club by the FA; under the current (2015–16) rules it must be returned by 1 March, or earlier if given seven days' notice [2] Traditionally, the holders had the Cup until the following year's presentation, although more recently the trophy has been taken on publicity tours by the FA in between finals [45]\n\n\nOriginal design from 1871\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of £20 [54] It was stolen from a Birmingham shoe shop window belonging to William Shillcock while held by Aston Villa on 11 September 1895 and was never seen again Despite a £10 reward for information, the crime was never solved As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa £25 to pay for a replacement.\n\n\n1871 original\nThe first trophy, the 'little tin idol', was made by Martin, Hall & Co at a cost of £20

crime was never solved As it happened while it was in their care, the FA fined Villa £25 to pay for a replacement.\n\n\n1895 replica\nAfter the theft, a replica of the trophy was made, which was used until a redesign of the trophy in 1911 The 1895 replica was then presented to the FA's long-serving president Lord Kinnaird [46] Kinnaird died in 1923, and his family kept it in their possession, out of view, until putting it up for auction in 2005 [56] It was sold at Christie's auction house on 19 May 2005 for £420,000 (£478,400 including auction fees and taxes) [46] The sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia, surpassing the £254,000 paid for the Jules Rimet World Cup Trophy in 1997 [47] The successful bidder was David Gold, the then joint chairman of Birmingham City; claiming the FA and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country, Gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation [47] Accordingly, Gold presented the trophy to the National Football Museum in Preston on 20 April 2006, where it went on immediate public display [56] It later moved with the museum to its new location in Manchester [46] In November 2012, it was ceremonially presented to Royal Engineers, after they beat Wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first FA Cup final In September 2020, Gold sold the replica trophy for £760,000 through the Bonhams auction house [57] In January 2021, it was revealed that the trophy had been purchased by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City, who stated that it would be returned on loan to the National Football Museum [58]\n\n\nCurrent design from 1911\nThe redesigned trophy first used in 1911 was larger at 61.5 cm (24.2 inches) high, and was designed and manufactured by Fattorini & Sons of Bradford, coincidentally being won by Bradford City in its first outing [45] [46]\n\n\n1911 original\nThe redesigned trophy first

2014 replica was made by Thomas Lyte, handcrafted in sterling 925 silver over 250 hours A weight increase for greater durability has taken it to 6.3 kilograms (14 lb) [45]\n\n\nMedals\nEach club in the final receives 40 winners or runners-up medals to be distributed among players, staff and officials The traditional styles of gold-cased medals – the winners' medal, which had remained largely unchanged since the 1890s, and runners-up medals, which were last updated in 1946 – were replaced for the 2021 final by new designs of gold winners' medals and silver runners-up medals suspended on a ribbon [62]\n\n\nSponsorship\nSince the start of the 1994–95 season, the FA Cup has been sponsored However, to protect the identity of the competition, the sponsored name has always included 'The FA Cup' in addition to the sponsor's name, unlike sponsorship deals for the League Cup where the word 'cup' is preceded by only the sponsor's name Sponsorship deals run for four years, though – as in the case of E.ON – one-year extensions may be agreed Emirates Airline has been the sponsor since 2015, initially renaming the competition as 'The Emirates FA Cup', unlike previous editions, which included 'The FA Cup in association with E.ON' and 'The FA Cup with Budweiser' [63] The Emirates sponsorship deal, originally scheduled to terminate in 2018, was later extended for three times until 2021, 2024, 2028 [64]\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nThe possibility of unlikely victories in the earlier rounds of the competition, where lower ranked teams beat higher placed opposition in what is known as

Cup competition Before its establishment as the dominant football competition in England, teams from rival leagues did make the final of the FA Cup The Wednesday (later Sheffield Wednesday) in 1890 reached the final as a member of the Football Alliance, two years before that competition merged with the Football League [81] Later, with the Football League predominantly in the North and Midlands of England, leading clubs of the Southern Football League were of a level with Football League teams, and in 1901 Southern League members Tottenham Hotspur became the only non-League side to win the Cup, [82] while fellow Southern League team Southampton were losing finalists in 1900 and 1902 In 1920–21, the Football League expanded to incorporate teams from the Southern League's first division, and the following year it added a further division consisting of leading northern and midlands clubs This consolidated the Football League's position as the leading competition in English football, and established the hierarchy in which non-League clubs in the English football league system competing in the FA Cup would face Football League teams as clear underdogs.\n\n\nNon-League giant killings\nSince the expansion of the Football League in 1921, the best performance of a team from outside the Football League was National League side Lincoln City's run to the quarter-finals of the 2016–17 FA Cup, during which they defeated Championship side Brighton 3–1 in the fourth round and Premier League side Burnley 1–0 in the fifth, before falling to ultimate Cup champions Arsenal 5–0 at the Emirates Lincoln's defeat of Burnley was only the third (and most recent) FA Cup victory for a non-league team over a top-flight side since 1989 [83] Giant-killings can also be applied where the defeated team is from lower down the Football League, particularly where the defeated club is very notable or the winning team particularly obscure Liverpool, having already won five league titles in their history, were in the Second Division in 1959 when they lost 2–1 to Worcester City of the Southern League [84]\n\n\nNon-League cup runs\nFor non-League teams, reaching the third round proper – where all Level 1 sides now enter – is considered a major achievement In the 2008–09 FA Cup, a record eight non-League teams achieved this feat [88] As of the 2023–24 season, only eleven non-League teams have reached the fifth round proper (last 16) since 1925, [89] and only Lincoln City have progressed to the quarter-finals (last 8), during the 2016–17 edition of the tournament [90]\n\n\nGiant killings between League clubs\nGiant-killings can apply to matches between league clubs, particularly where teams from tier 4 have defeated tier 1 sides In games between League sides, one of the most notable results was the 1992 victory by Wrexham, bottom of the previous season's League (avoiding relegation due to expansion of The Football League), over reigning champions Arsenal Another similar shock was when Shrewsbury Town beat Everton 2–1 in 2003 Everton finished seventh in the Premier League and Shrewsbury Town were relegated to the Football Conference that same season.\n\n\nWinners and

Queen's Park ceased to be eligible to enter the FA Cup after a Scottish Football Association ruling in 1887 [96]\n\n\nConsecutive winners\nFour clubs have won consecutive FA Cups on more than one occasion: Wanderers (1872, 1873 and 1876, 1877, 1878), Blackburn Rovers (1884, 1885, 1886 and 1890, 1891), Tottenham Hotspur (1961, 1962 and 1981, 1982) and Arsenal (2002, 2003 and 2014, 2015).\n\n\nWinning managers\nThe record for most titles for a manager is held by Arsène Wenger, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal seven times (1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014, 2015, 2017) Wenger is also the only manager to have won the Cup at the old Wembley Stadium, the Millennium Stadium, and the new Wembley Stadium.\n\n\nDoubles/Trebles\nManchester City (2019) are the only club to have achieved a domestic treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup, having beaten Chelsea 4–3 on penalties in the League Cup Final, finished at the top of the Premier League, and beaten Watford 6–0 in the FA Cup Final.\n\n\nOutside England\nThe FA Cup has only been won by a non-English team once Cardiff City achieved this in 1927 when they beat Arsenal in the final at Wembley They had previously made it to the final only to lose to Sheffield United in 1925 and lost another final to Portsmouth in 2008 Cardiff City are also the only team to win the national cups of two countries in the same season, having also won the Welsh Cup in 1927 The Scottish team Queen's Park reached and lost the final in both 1884 and 1885.\n\n\nOutside the top division\nSince the creation of the Football League in 1888, the final has never been contested by two teams from outside the top division, and there have only been eight winners who were not in the top flight: Notts County (1894); Tottenham Hotspur (1901); Wolverhampton Wanderers (1908); Barnsley (1912); West Bromwich Albion (1931); Sunderland (1973), Southampton (1976) and West Ham United (1980) With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) – Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-League winners of the FA Cup since the League's creation Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902, then in the Southern League) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events.\n\n\nDomestic broadcasters\nThe FA Cup Final is one of 10 events reserved for live broadcast on UK terrestrial television under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events.\n\n\n1997 to 2001\nFrom 1997 to 2001, Sky owned the coverage showing one match per round, with the free-to-air rights sublicensed to ITV who showed an additional match from the third round onwards [100]: 44  The BBC continued with highlights on Match of the Day.\n\n\n2001 to 2008\nFrom 2001 to 2008, BBC and Sky again shared coverage with BBC having two or three matches per round and Sky having one or two.\n\n\n2008 to 2009\nFrom 2008–09 to 2013–14, FA Cup matches were shown live by ITV across England and Wales, with UTV broadcasting to Northern Ireland Scottish member STV refused to show them, and instead the regularly advertised programming that otherwise would mostly have been shown across the UK (new and repeated network entertainment and drama content, films, local productions etc.) would continue as normal in a delayed or exclusive fashion while the rest of the ITV network aired the football ITV showed 16 FA Cup games per season, including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition, plus one semi-final exclusively live The final was also shown live on ITV Under the same 2008 contract, Setanta Sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final The channel also broadcast ITV's matches, albeit with their own commentary teams, exclusively to Scotland, after STV's decision to replace the games with regular programming Setanta entered administration in June 2009 and as a result the FA terminated Setanta's deal to broadcast FA-sanctioned competitions and England internationals [101]\n\n\n2009 to 2010\nAs a result of Setanta going out of business ITV showed the competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four matches per round, all quarter finals, semi-finals and final live as the FA could not find a pay TV broadcaster in time Many [who?] expected BSkyB to make a bid to show some of the remaining FA Cup games for the remainder of the 2009–10 season which would include a semi-final and shared rights to the final.\n\n\n2010 to 2014\nESPN bought the competition for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time Rebecca Lowe became the first woman to host the FA Cup Final in the UK.\n\n\n2014 to 2019\nITV lost the rights to the FA Cup beginning with the 2014–15 FA Cup, terrestrial rights returned to BBC Sport, with the final being shown on BBC One while BT Sport hold the pay TV rights Under this deal, the BBC will show around the same number of games as ITV and still having the first pick for each round [109]\n\n\n2019 onwards\nOn 23 May 2019, it was announced that ITV would replace BT Sport in broadcasting the FA Cup from the 2021–22 season, this new deal will see BBC and ITV become joint broadcasters of the tournament for the first time since 1988, this will mean for the first time that all FA Cup matches would all be exclusively broadcast on free-to-air television [112]\n\n\nOverseas broadcasters\nThe FA sells overseas rights separately from the domestic

As Rajiv leaves the room, Chozhan is left to ponder the outcome, only to discover the lifeless body of Parirajan lying on the floor. The police arrive, and Chozhan reveals to the inspector and his own risk-averse father, Ramalingam, that he can solve the murder using his skills.

feuds (2001–2003)\nEdge solidified himself as an emerging singles competitor by winning the 2001 King of the Ring tournament and slowly becoming a fan favourite by siding with the WWF during the Invasion storyline [59] Christian betrayed Edge shortly afterward, [60] and the two feuded over Edge's Intercontinental Championship (which he won at SummerSlam on August 19) that he later lost to

Jericho, Copeland said that he did not initially like the idea of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the WrestleMania 21 card altogether However, he was talked into competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs who said the match had the potential to be a big success At Backlash on May 1, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud [89] Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him the Gold

{"title": "Black_Death", "content": "\nNames\nEuropean writers contemporary with the plague described the disease in Latin as pestis or pestilentia, 'pestilence'; epidemia, 'epidemic'; mortalitas, 'mortality' [22] In English prior to the 18th century, the event was called the \"pestilence\" or \"great pestilence\", \"the plague\" or the \"great death\" [22] [23] [24] Subsequent to the pandemic \"the furste moreyn\" (first murrain) or \"first pestilence\" was applied, to distinguish the mid-14th century phenomenon from other infectious diseases and epidemics of plague [22]\n\n\nPrevious plague epidemics\nResearch from 2017 suggests plague first infected humans in Europe and Asia in the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age [37] Research in 2018 found evidence of Yersinia pestis in an ancient Swedish tomb, which may have been associated with the \"Neolithic decline\" around 3000 BCE, in which European populations fell significantly [38] [39] This Y pestis may have been different from more modern types, with bubonic plague transmissible by fleas first known from Bronze Age remains near Samara [40]\n\n\n14th-century plague\nA report by the Medical Faculty of Paris stated that a conjunction of planets had caused \"a great pestilence in the air\" (miasma theory) [46] Muslim religious scholars taught that the pandemic was a \"martyrdom and mercy\" from God, assuring the believer's place in paradise For non-believers, it was a punishment [47] [page needed] Some Muslim doctors cautioned against trying to prevent or treat a disease sent by God Others adopted preventive measures and treatments for plague used by Europeans These Muslim doctors also depended on the writings of the ancient Greeks [48] [49]\n\n\nCauses\nA report by the Medical Faculty of Paris stated

adopted preventive measures and treatments for plague used by Europeans These Muslim doctors also depended on the writings of the ancient Greeks [48] [49]\n\n\nPredominant modern theory\nDue to climate change in Asia, rodents began to flee the dried-out grasslands to more populated areas, spreading the disease [50] The plague disease, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas, including Central Asia, Kurdistan, West Asia, North India, Uganda, and the western United States [51] [52]\n\n\nDNA evidence\nDefinitive confirmation of the role of Y pestis arrived in 2010 with a publication in PLOS Pathogens by Haensch et al [4] [c] They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for Y pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \"ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\" [4] In 2011 these results were further confirmed with genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England Schuenemann et al concluded in 2011 \"that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y pestis that may no longer exist\" [58]\n\n\nAlternative explanations\nResearchers are hampered by a lack of reliable statistics from this period Most work has been done on the spread of the disease in England, where estimates of overall population at the start of the plague vary by over 100%, as no census was undertaken in England between the time of publication of the Domesday Book of 1086 and the poll tax of the year 1377 [65] Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures for the clergy.\n\n\nSummary\nAcademic debate continues, but no single alternative explanation for the plague's spread has achieved widespread acceptance [33] Many scholars arguing for Y pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox, and respiratory infections In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic and pneumonic forms of plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms [72] In 2014, Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis [62] Currently, while osteoarcheologists have conclusively verified the presence of Y pestis bacteria in burial sites across northern Europe through examination of bones and dental pulp, no other epidemic pathogen has been discovered to bolster the alternative explanations [73]\n\n\nTransmission\nThe importance of hygiene was not recognized until the 19th century and the germ theory of disease Until then streets were usually unhygienic, with live animals and human parasites facilitating the spread of transmissible disease [74]\n\n\nLack of hygiene\nThe importance of hygiene was not recognized until the 19th century and the germ theory of disease Until then streets were usually unhygienic, with live animals and human parasites facilitating the spread of transmissible disease [74]\n\n\nTerritorial origins\nAccording to a team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman, Yersinia pestis \"evolved in or near China\" over 2,600 years ago [78] [79] [80] Later research by a team led by Galina Eroshenko placed its origins more specifically in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China [81] [82] However more recent research notes that the previous sampling contained East Asian bias and that sampling since then has discovered strains of Y pestis in the Caucasus region previously thought to be restricted to China [83] There is also no physical or specific textual evidence of the Black Death in 14th century China As a result, China's place in the sequence of the plague's spread is still debated to this day [84] According to Charles Creighton, records of epidemics in 14th-century China suggest nothing more than typhus and major Chinese outbreaks of epidemic disease post-date the European epidemic by several years [85] The earliest Chinese descriptions of the bubonic plague do not appear until the 1640s [86]\n\n\nEuropean outbreak\nThe seventh year after it began, it came to England and first began in the towns and ports joining on the seacoasts, in Dorsetshire, where, as in other counties, it made the country quite void of inhabitants so that there were almost none left alive.\n.. But at length it came to Gloucester, yea even to Oxford and to London, and finally it spread over all England and so wasted the people that scarce the tenth person of any sort was left alive.\n\n\nWest Asian and North African outbreak\nThe disease struck various regions in the Middle East and North Africa during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures [113]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms of the plague include fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise Left untreated, 80% of victims die within eight days [119]\n\n\nBubonic plague\nSymptoms of the plague include fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise Left untreated, 80% of victims die within eight days [119]\n\n\nPneumonic plague\nLodewijk Heyligen, whose master Cardinal Giovanni Colonna died of plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease, pneumonic plague, that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems [72] Symptoms include fever, cough and blood-tinged sputum As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90–95% [125]\n\n\nSepticemic plague\nSepticemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with an untreated mortality rate near 100% Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation) [125] In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes [125]\n\n\nConsequences\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality Urban centers with higher populations suffered longer periods of abnormal mortality [126] Some estimate that it may have killed between 75,000,000 and 200,000,000 people in Eurasia [127] [128] [129] [better source needed] A study published in 2022 of pollen samples across Europe from 1250 to 1450 was used to estimate changes in agricultural output before and after the Black Death The authors found great variability in different regions, with evidence for high mortality in areas of Scandinavia, France, western Germany, Greece, and central Italy, but uninterrupted agricultural growth in central and eastern Europe, Iberia, and Ireland [130] The authors concluded that \"the pandemic was immensely destructive in some areas, but in others it had a far lighter touch ..  [the study methodology] invalidates histories of the Black Death that assume Y pestis was uniformly prevalent, or nearly so, across Europe and that the pandemic had a devastating demographic impact everywhere.\"\n\n\nDeaths\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality Urban centers with higher populations suffered longer periods of abnormal mortality [126] Some estimate that it may have killed between 75,000,000 and 200,000,000 people in Eurasia [127] [128] [129] [better source needed] A study published in 2022 of pollen samples across Europe from 1250 to 1450 was used to estimate changes in agricultural output before and after the Black Death The authors found great variability in different regions, with evidence for high mortality in areas of Scandinavia, France, western Germany, Greece, and central Italy, but uninterrupted agricultural growth in central and eastern Europe, Iberia, and Ireland [130] The authors concluded that \"the pandemic was immensely destructive in some areas, but in others it had a far lighter touch ..

Left untreated, 80% of victims die within eight days.\n\n**Bubonic plague**\n\nSymptoms of the plague include fever of 38-41°C (100-106°F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, 80% of victims die within eight days.\n\n**Pneumonic plague**\n\nLodewijk Heyligen, whose master Cardinal Giovanni Colonna died of plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease, pneumonic plague, that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems. Symptoms include fever, cough and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90-95%.\n\n**Septicemic plague**\n\nSepticemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with an untreated mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality. Urban centers with higher populations suffered longer periods of abnormal mortality. Some estimate that it may have killed between 75,000,000 and 200,000,000 people in Eurasia.\n\n**Economic**\n\nIt has been suggested that the Black Death, like other outbreaks through history, disproportionately affected the poorest people and those already in worse physical condition than the wealthier citizens.\n\n**Environmental**\n\nA study performed by Thomas Van Hoof of the Utrecht University suggests that the innumerable deaths brought on by the pandemic cooled the climate by freeing up land and triggering reforestation.

It is feared that the plague bacterium could develop drug resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995. Another outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014. In October 2017, the deadliest outbreak of the plague in modern times hit Madagascar, killing 170 people and infecting thousands.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Black_Death\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames\nEuropean writers contemporary with the plague described the disease in Latin as pestis or pestilentia, 'pestilence'; epidemia, 'epidemic'; mortalitas, 'mortality' [22] In English prior to the 18th century, the event was called the \"pestilence\" or \"great pestilence\", \"the plague\" or the \"great death\" [22] [23] [24] Subsequent to the pandemic \"the furste moreyn\" (first murrain) or \"first pestilence\" was applied, to distinguish the mid-14th century phenomenon from other infectious diseases and epidemics of plague [22]\n\n\nPrevious plague epidemics\nResearch from 2017 suggests plague first infected humans in Europe and Asia in the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age [37] Research in 2018 found evidence of Yersinia pestis in an ancient Swedish tomb, which may have been associated with the \"Neolithic decline\" around 3000 BCE, in which European populations fell significantly [38] [39] This Y pestis may have been different from more modern types, with bubonic plague transmissible by fleas first known from Bronze Age remains near Samara [40]\n\n\n14th-century plague\nA report by the Medical Faculty of Paris stated that a conjunction of planets had caused \"a great pestilence in the air\" (miasma theory) [46] Muslim religious scholars taught that the pandemic was a \"martyrdom and mercy\" from God, assuring the believer's place in paradise For non-believers, it was a punishment [47] [page needed] Some Muslim doctors cautioned against trying to prevent or treat a disease sent by God Others adopted preventive measures and treatments for plague used by Europeans These Muslim doctors also depended on the writings of the ancient Greeks [48] [49]\n\n\nCauses\nA report by the Medical Faculty

Others adopted preventive measures and treatments for plague used by Europeans These Muslim doctors also depended on the writings of the ancient Greeks [48] [49]\n\n\nPredominant modern theory\nDue to climate change in Asia, rodents began to flee the dried-out grasslands to more populated areas, spreading the disease [50] The plague disease, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas, including Central Asia, Kurdistan, West Asia, North India, Uganda, and the western United States [51] [52]\n\n\nDNA evidence\nDefinitive confirmation of the role of Y pestis arrived in 2010 with a publication in PLOS Pathogens by Haensch et al [4] [c] They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques for Y pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \"ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\" [4] In 2011 these results were further confirmed with genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the East Smithfield burial site in England Schuenemann et al concluded in 2011 \"that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of Y pestis that may no longer exist\" [58]\n\n\nAlternative explanations\nResearchers are hampered by a lack of reliable statistics from this period Most work has been done on the spread of the disease in England, where estimates of overall population at the start of the plague vary by over 100%, as no census was undertaken in England between the time of publication of the Domesday Book of 1086 and the poll tax of the year 1377 [65] Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures for the clergy.\n\n\nSummary\nAcademic debate continues, but no single alternative explanation for the plague's spread has achieved widespread acceptance [33] Many scholars arguing for Y pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox, and respiratory infections In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic and pneumonic forms of plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms [72] In 2014, Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed in the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis [62] Currently, while osteoarcheologists have conclusively verified the presence of Y pestis bacteria in burial sites across northern Europe through examination of bones and dental pulp, no other epidemic pathogen has been discovered to bolster the alternative explanations [73]\n\n\nTransmission\nThe importance of hygiene was not recognized until the 19th century and the germ theory of disease Until then streets were usually unhygienic, with live animals and human parasites facilitating the spread of transmissible disease [74]\n\n\nLack of hygiene\nThe importance of hygiene was not recognized until the 19th century and the germ theory of disease Until then streets were usually unhygienic, with live animals and human parasites facilitating the spread of transmissible disease [74]\n\n\nTerritorial origins\nAccording to a team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman, Yersinia pestis \"evolved in or near China\" over 2,600 years ago [78] [79] [80] Later research by a team led by Galina Eroshenko placed its origins more specifically in the Tian Shan mountains on the border between Kyrgyzstan and China [81] [82] However more recent research notes that the previous sampling contained East Asian bias and that sampling since then has discovered strains of Y pestis in the Caucasus region previously thought to be restricted to China [83] There is also no physical or specific textual evidence of the Black Death in 14th century China As a result, China's place in the sequence of the plague's spread is still debated to this day [84] According to Charles Creighton, records of epidemics in 14th-century China suggest nothing more than typhus and major Chinese outbreaks of epidemic disease post-date the European epidemic by several years [85] The earliest Chinese descriptions of the bubonic plague do not appear until the 1640s [86]\n\n\nEuropean outbreak\nThe seventh year after it began, it came to England and first began in the towns and ports joining on the seacoasts, in Dorsetshire, where, as in other counties, it made the country quite void of inhabitants so that there were almost none left alive.\n.. But at length it came to Gloucester, yea even to Oxford and to London, and finally it spread over all England and so wasted the people that scarce the tenth person of any sort was left alive.\n\n\nWest Asian and North African outbreak\nThe disease struck various regions in the Middle East and North Africa during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures [113]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms of the plague include fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise Left untreated, 80% of victims die within eight days [119]\n\n\nBubonic plague\nSymptoms of the plague include fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise Left untreated, 80% of victims die within eight days [119]\n\n\nPneumonic plague\nLodewijk Heyligen, whose master Cardinal Giovanni Colonna died of plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease, pneumonic plague, that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems [72] Symptoms include fever, cough and blood-tinged sputum As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90–95% [125]\n\n\nSepticemic plague\nSepticemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with an untreated mortality rate near 100% Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation) [125] In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes [125]\n\n\nConsequences\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality Urban centers with higher populations suffered longer periods of abnormal mortality [126] Some estimate that it may have killed between 75,000,000 and 200,000,000 people in Eurasia [127] [128] [129] [better source needed] A study published in 2022 of pollen samples across Europe from 1250 to 1450 was used to estimate changes in agricultural output before and after the Black Death The authors found great variability in different regions, with evidence for high mortality in areas of Scandinavia, France, western Germany, Greece, and central Italy, but uninterrupted agricultural growth in central and eastern Europe, Iberia, and Ireland [130] The authors concluded that \"the pandemic was immensely destructive in some areas, but in others it had a far lighter touch ..  [the study methodology] invalidates histories of the Black Death that assume Y pestis was uniformly prevalent, or nearly so, across Europe and that the pandemic had a devastating demographic impact everywhere.\"\n\n\nDeaths\nThere are no exact figures for the death toll; the rate varied widely by locality Urban centers with higher populations suffered longer periods of abnormal mortality [126] Some estimate that it may have killed between 75,000,000 and 200,000,000 people in Eurasia [127] [128] [129] [better source needed] A study published in 2022 of pollen samples across Europe from 1250 to 1450 was used to estimate changes in agricultural output before and after the Black Death The authors found great variability in different regions, with evidence for high mortality in areas of Scandinavia, France, western Germany, Greece, and central Italy, but uninterrupted agricultural growth in central and eastern Europe, Iberia, and Ireland [130] The authors concluded that \"the pandemic was immensely destructive in some areas, but in others it had a far lighter touch ..  [the study methodology] invalidates histories of the Black Death that assume Y pestis was uniformly prevalent, or nearly so, across Europe and that the pandemic had a devastating demographic impact everywhere.\"\n\n\nEconomic\nIt has been suggested that the Black Death, like other outbreaks through history, disproportionately affected the poorest people and those already in worse physical condition than the wealthier citizens [146]\n\n\nEnvironmental\nA study performed by Thomas Van Hoof of the Utrecht University suggests that the innumerable deaths brought on by the pandemic cooled the climate by freeing up land and triggering reforestation This may have led to the Little Ice Age [151]\n\n\nPersecutions\nRenewed religious fervor and fanaticism increased in the wake of the Black Death Some Europeans targeted \"various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims\", lepers, [152] [153] and Romani, blaming them for the crisis Lepers, and others with skin diseases such as acne or psoriasis, were killed throughout Europe.\n\n\nSocial\nOne theory that has been advanced is that the Black Death's devastation of Florence, between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century Italy that ultimately led to the Renaissance Italy was particularly badly hit by the pandemic, and the resulting familiarity with death may have caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on Earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife [158] [j] It has also been argued that the Black Death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art [160]\n\n\nRecurrences\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries [169] According to Jean-Noël Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671 (although some researchers have cautions about the uncritical use of Biraben's data) [170] [171] The second pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360–1363; 1374; 1400; 1438–1439; 1456–1457; 1464–1466; 1481–1485; 1500–1503; 1518–1531; 1544–1548; 1563–1566; 1573–1588; 1596–1599; 1602–1611; 1623–1640; 1644–1654; and 1664–1667 Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the plague's retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and North Africa (19th century) [172]\n\n\nSecond plague pandemic\nThe plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries [169] According to Jean-Noël Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671 (although some researchers have cautions about the uncritical use of Biraben's data) [170] [171] The second pandemic was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360–1363;

newspaper The Herald that he had been bullied at school since the Olympics, [34] and his father told the BBC that he had temporarily withdrawn him from that school because its response to the problem had been \"ineffective\" [35] Daley was praised in the media for speaking out about his problem [36] [37]\n\n\nInternational competitions\nIn January 2007, at the age of twelve, Daley was given a

Robert Daley [20] [21] was born on 21 May 1994 at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, England, [2] [22] the son of Debbie (née Selvester) and Robert Daley [23] [24] He has two brothers – William who is three years younger, and Ben who is five years younger [25] Their father, Robert, died from a brain tumour on 27 May 2011, aged 40, a few days after Daley's 17th birthday [26] His early diving hero was Canadian diver Alexandre Despatie, who won gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games at the age of 13, [27] and British diver Leon Taylor, who later mentored him [28]\nDaley was spotted by a coach taking part in regular diving lessons and was placed in a competitive squad in September 2002 His first competition was the National Novice Championships in April 2003 where he won a medal in the 8/9-year-old boys category In September 2003, he took part in an invitational event in Southampton where he won the 1 m, 3 m and platform events, and first made his mark on the wider audience Daley won his age group at the British Championships in the 1 m springboard, the 3 m springboard, and platform in 2004, 2005, and 2006 [29]\n\n\nEducation\nFrom age 11 to 14, Daley attended Eggbuckland Community College in Plymouth [32] At 13, he became a celebrity supporter of Childline, a children's helpline run by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and at that time it was revealed that he had been bullied eighteen months earlier [33] In April 2009, Daley told Plymouth's main local newspaper The Herald that he had been bullied at school since the Olympics, [34] and his father told the BBC that he had temporarily withdrawn him from that school because its response to the problem had been \"ineffective\" [35] Daley was praised in the media for speaking out about his problem [36] [37]\n\n\nInternational competitions\nIn January 2007, at the age of twelve, Daley was given a special dispensation to compete at the 2007 Australian Youth Olympic Festival [44] The usual minimum age is fifteen Competing with a persistent thumb injury, Daley won the silver medal with synchro-partner Callum Johnstone in the 10 m synchronised diving final [45]\n\n\n2007\nIn January 2007, at the age of twelve, Daley was given a special dispensation to compete at the 2007 Australian Youth Olympic Festival [44] The usual minimum age is fifteen Competing with a persistent thumb injury, Daley won the silver medal with synchro-partner Callum Johnstone in the 10 m synchronised diving final [45]\n\n\n2008\nIn January 2008, Daley won the 10 m platform event at the British Championships and became the youngest winner of the senior British 10 m title [46] He also won the 10 m platform synchro title with new partner Blake Aldridge.\n\n\n2009\nIn February 2009, Daley retained his individual British 10 m championship, setting a competition personal best score of 517.55 points, 133.45 points ahead of the second-placed diver He was unable to defend his 10 m synchronized title, as his dive partner Blake Aldridge had been injured in a brawl at a nightclub several days before the championships and was unable to dive [55] [56] In March 2009, he improved his personal best to 540.70 in coming third at a Diving World Series event in China, [57] and the following month he improved it to 540.85 while finishing second at the World Series event in Sheffield [58]\n\n\n2010\nIn the February 2010 British Championships individual 10 m competition, Daley unveiled his 5255B dive (back two-and-a-half somersault, one-and-a-half twists, with pike) in competition for the first time, giving him a 3.6 tariff dive (reduced from 3.8 in FINAs' September 2009 DD tables [64]) In this competition Daley finished in second place, 40.05 points behind Peter Waterfield [65] [66]\n\n\n2011\nFor the 2011 season, Daley was paired in the synchronized competitions with 2004 Athens Olympic silver medallist Peter Waterfield in British Swimming's continuing efforts to find the best synchro pairing for the 2012 Olympics [75] At the 2011 National Cup, the British Championship was held in the new Southend Swimming and Diving Centre on 28–30 January and Daley came second in the 3m springboard competition behind Jack Laugher With Waterfield, he won the 10 m platform synchronized competition [76] The following day, Waterfield beat Daley to the individual 10 m platform title for the second successive year, by 494.25 points to 472.35, with Max Brick third with 399.80 [77]\n\n\n2012\nIn the 2012 season, a thumb injury forced Daley's withdrawal from the National Cup a few days before the competition (the 10m platform title was won by Max Brick) In February 2012, British Diving's Performance Director Alexei Evangulov criticised Daley's work ethic, stating that he feared Daley's media and commercial activities were to the detriment of his training for the Olympics – a comment which was seemingly backed up when Daley and Pete Waterfield could only finish 7th in the 10 m synchro competition in the FINA World Cup event held at the London Aquatics Centre [81]\n\n\nOlympics\nIn Britain, Daley had long been considered one of the \"poster boys\" of the 2012 Summer Olympics, (literally – an 80-foot tall banner depicting him adorned the John Lewis department store in Cardiff, while a 40-foot tall banner of his female equivalent, heptathlete Jessica Ennis, was on the Sheffield branch of the store chain [91])\n\n\nWorld Junior Diving Championships\nAt the 19th FINA World Junior Diving Championships, held in October 2012 in Adelaide, Australia, Daley led a strong British team and rather unexpectedly won the Boys \"A\" 3 m synchronized springboard competition together with Jack Laugher, who had won the individual 3 m competition, they had had little practice together Daley and Laugher scored 338.85 points, over 30 points ahead of Ilia Kuzmin and Maxim Popkov [96]\n\n\n2013\nIn January 2013, Daley was involved in the ITV celebrity diving show Splash!, where he was an expert adviser to the celebrity contestants [99] While the show got a largely negative critical response, it nevertheless got the largest ratings on each of the five Saturday nights it was broadcast, and was renewed for a second season in 2014 Daley was warned by British Swimming chief executive David Sparkes that taking part in the series would risk damaging his chances of winning an Olympic gold medal in the future [100]\n\n\n2014\nAt the beginning of 2014, Daley moved his training base from the Life Centre in Plymouth to the London Aquatics Centre at the Olympic Park in east London, with a new coach, Jane Figueiredo [103]\n\n\n2015\nFor the 2015 season, Daley dropped the \"demon dive\" (backward 2.5 somersault with 2.5 twists, piked) which he had experienced difficulty with for several years, and replaced it with a forward 3.5 somersaults with one twist, which he called his \"firework\" dive and displayed for the first time at the British championships in Plymouth in February [110]\n\n\n2016\nFor the 2016 season, Daley was paired with Daniel Goodfellow for the 10 m men's platform synchro competition, with a view to competing in the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics in this sport.\n\n\n2017\nIn the 2017 FINA World Series, Daley took home 1 bronze medal in Beijing (10 m Platform), 3 bronze medals in Kazan (10 m Platform, 10 m Synchro, and 3 m Mixed), and one silver medal in Guangzhou (10 m Platform) On 22 July 2017, he won the gold medal in the 10 m platform event at the FINA World Championships held in Budapest.\n\n\n2018–2019\nIn the 2018 FINA Diving World Series, Daley won 1 silver medal and 1 bronze medal in Beijing (3 m Mixed and 10 m Synchro), 1 silver medal in Fuji (3 m Mixed), 1 silver medal in Montreal (3 m Mixed), and 1 silver medal in Kazan (3 m Mixed).\n\n\n2021\nAt the 2021 FINA Diving World Cup, which was held in Japan as an official test event for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, [a] Daley won his first World Cup gold with Matty Lee in synchronized 10 m platform [123] He also won gold in the individual 10 m platform [124] At the European Championships held in Budapest, Daley and Lee also won gold in synchronized 10 m platform, [125] and a silver in the individual 10 m platform [126]\n\n\n2024\nDaley was selected to take part in the 10 metre platform synchronised event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris with Noah Williams; [130] [131] the pair went on to win the silver medal [132] He was also chosen to be one of Team GB's flag-bearers at the opening ceremony alongside rower Helen Glover [133] [134] [135] The day after the closing ceremony, Daley announced his official retirement from diving [136] [19]\n\n\nCompetitive history\n† with Blake Aldridge\n§ with Max Brick\n@

White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress.\" [29] Clarkson went on to win the competition on September 4, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini [30]\n\n\n2002–2003: American Idol, World Idol, and Thankful\nUpon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series American Idol: The Search for a Superstar in May 2002 Despite receiving a \"golden ticket\", a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred to the inaugural season as \"ghetto\", explaining: \"On our season we were like kids in camp Nobody knew what to do The show was ever changing every day They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK, but America is a very different market They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television' I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get What do I buy? White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress.\" [29] Clarkson went on to win the competition on September 4, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini [30]\n\n\n2004–2006: New management and Breakaway\nTrying to distance herself from her American Idol image, Clarkson decided to leave Fuller and 19 Management and hired the services of talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm She reinvented herself to some extent, developing a more rock-oriented sound with her second studio album, Breakaway Davis served as the executive producer for the record, while Clarkson co-wrote six of the tracks with pop and rock songwriters such as former Evanescence band members Ben Moody and David Hodges, Kara DioGuardi, Dr Luke and Max Martin Breakaway received critical acclaim, with Erlewine of AllMusic remarking: \"What gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the tracks that illustrate Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream.\" [44]\n\n\n2007–2009: My December and All I Ever Wanted\nClarkson's third studio album, My December, was released on June 22, 2007 The album relied on darker themes and heavier rock music [5] [59] She replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks [60] She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators [5] [61] Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis He noted the album's lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused [5] Clarkson defended herself saying, \"I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what I have to say I couldn't give a crap about being a star I've always just wanted to sing and write.\" [62] The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore [5] [63] [64] Clarkson later hired talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as \"a

she \"showed off a voice that moved in all sorts of ways, without ever appearing to strain\", continuing \"Ms Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making\" However, in a separate review of Stronger, Caramanica said Clarkson's voice is \"too huge, too violent\" for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating \"she's on a par with Taylor Swift when it comes to vengeance, and she'll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary.\" [182] [183] In a live review as part of her Stronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair of Hit The Floor said \"Kelly's strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night, and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums\" [184] Mark Deming from Phoenix

passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go.\" [185]\n\n\nVoice\nCritics have said Clarkson has a soprano voice [177] [178] [179] [180] Arion

White pants I guess? I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress.\" [29] Clarkson went on to win the competition on September 4, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini [30]\n\n\n2002–2003: American Idol, World Idol, and Thankful\nUpon returning to Burleson, Clarkson was encouraged by her friends to audition for the inaugural season of the reality television series American Idol: The Search for a Superstar in May 2002 Despite receiving a \"golden ticket\", a pass to the Hollywood rounds, in the series premiere, Clarkson made her first appearance during the second episode In an interview in 2012, Clarkson referred to the inaugural season as \"ghetto\", explaining: \"On our season we were like kids in camp Nobody knew what to do The show was ever changing every day They did one season of Pop Idol in the UK, but America is a very different market They dropped us off in a mall and said 'find some clothes to wear on national television' I am maybe the closest to white trash you can get What do I buy?

I definitely looked like a cocktail waitress.\" [29] Clarkson went on to win the competition on September 4, 2002, at the Kodak Theatre (now Dolby), earning 58% of the votes against runner-up Justin Guarini [30]\n\n\n2004–2006: New management and Breakaway\nTrying to distance herself from her American Idol image, Clarkson decided to leave Fuller and 19 Management and hired the services of talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm She reinvented herself to some extent, developing a more rock-oriented sound with her second studio album, Breakaway Davis served as the executive producer for the record, while Clarkson co-wrote six of the tracks with pop and rock songwriters such as former Evanescence band members Ben Moody and David Hodges, Kara DioGuardi, Dr Luke and Max Martin Breakaway received critical acclaim, with Erlewine of AllMusic remarking: \"What gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off, and they are the tracks that illustrate Clarkson is a rare thing in the 2000s: a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream.\" [44]\n\n\n2007–2009: My December and All I Ever Wanted\nClarkson's third studio album, My December, was released on June 22, 2007 The album relied on darker themes and heavier rock music [5] [59] She replaced Davis as the executive producer and co-wrote all the tracks [60] She opted to collaborate with her band members rather than her previous producers and collaborators [5] [61] Its production and release became a subject of a dispute with RCA, particularly with Davis He noted the album's lack of professional production input and wanted her to re-record tracks with a more mainstream appeal, which she refused [5] Clarkson defended herself saying, \"I've sold more than 15 million records worldwide, and still nobody listens to what I have to say I couldn't give a crap about being a star I've always just wanted to sing and write.\" [62] The album received positive response, but lack of promotion due to reluctance of RCA led Clarkson to dismiss Kwatinetz and Live Nation to cancel its accompanying tour, the My December Tour, and reschedule it into a smaller scale with supporting acts Jon McLaughlin, Sean Kingston and Mandy Moore [5] [63] [64] Clarkson later hired talent manager Narvel Blackstock of Starstruck Management Blackstock was the husband of country artist Reba McEntire, of whom Clarkson is a close friend Clarkson later issued an apology to Davis, citing him as \"a

\"I've got a few ideas – there could be a lullaby for each book We've got a plethora of stories, and I've already written seven songs, full out, so we'll just have to see which ones might pan out to be a book But yes, there will definitely be more.\" [116] The second book featuring River Rose, River Rose and the Magical Christmas, was released on October 24, 2017, and included an original song

are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her mid-range is amazingly confident.\" [181] In reviewing a live performance of Clarkson's, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said she \"showed off a voice that moved in all sorts of ways, without ever appearing to strain\", continuing \"Ms Clarkson, who has a malleable voice and a boatload of vocal confidence, might be a soul siren in the making\" However, in a separate review of Stronger, Caramanica said Clarkson's voice is \"too huge, too violent\" for warmer and sweeter vocal stylings, stating \"she's on a par with Taylor Swift when it comes to vengeance, and she'll do it louder and with more brutality in comparison to her contemporary.\" [182] [183] In a live review as part of her Stronger Tour, Sophie Sinclair of Hit The Floor said \"Kelly's strong and powerful voice was flawless throughout the night, and some may even say she sounds better live than she does on her albums\" [184] Mark Deming from Phoenix New Times stated that \"in an era when pop music means over-singing a song into a bloody pulp, Clarkson has consistently displayed both charisma and a welcome sense of restraint, knowing how to sound passionate and heartfelt without forgetting where the melody and the root note is supposed to go.\" [185]\n\n\nVoice\nCritics have said Clarkson has a soprano voice [177] [178] [179] [180] Arion

praised the show's character-building, action, animation, visuals, humor, and the handling of Gabimaru's versions of his story which tells about \"how he's feeling and what he wishes he'd done differently\" He felt that some fans might found that the opening episode of the series was a little slow, but stating that \"the way it centers the backstory of its protagonist and immediately

This article explores the theoretical and practical aspects of impossible color, including its relationship to the color opponent process, imaginary colors, chimerical colors, and colors outside the physical color space.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nColor is a fundamental aspect of our visual experience, and the human visual system is capable of perceiving a vast range of colors. However, there are limits to the colors that can be seen, and some colors are theoretically impossible to perceive under normal circumstances. The concept of impossible color raises interesting questions about the nature of color and the limitations of human vision.\n\n**Opponent Process**\n\nThe color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. The three types of cone cells have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. This opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels:\n\n* Red-green opponent channel, which is sensitive to the difference between long-wavelength (red) and medium-wavelength (green) light\n* Yellow-blue opponent channel, which is sensitive to the difference between medium-wavelength (green-yellow) and short-wavelength (blue) light\n* Black-white opponent channel, which is sensitive to the intensity of light\n\n**Imaginary Colors**\n\nA fictitious color or imaginary color is a point in a color space that corresponds to combinations of cone cell responses in one eye that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances, seeing any possible light spectrum. No physical object can have an imaginary color, as it is a purely theoretical concept. Imaginary colors are often found in the mathematical descriptions that define color spaces, and they can be used to explore the theoretical limits of color.\n\n**Imaginary Colors in Color Spaces**\n\nAlthough they cannot be seen, imaginary colors are often found in the mathematical descriptions that define color spaces. These colors are typically represented as points in a multidimensional color space, and they can be used to explore the theoretical limits of color. For example, in the CIE 1931 color space, which is a widely used color space, there are points that correspond to imaginary colors that cannot be perceived by the human eye.\n\n**Chimerical Colors**\n\nA chimerical color is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color until some of the cone cells become fatigued, temporarily changing their color sensitivities, and then looking at a markedly different color. The direct trichromatic description of vision cannot explain these colors, which can involve saturation signals outside the physical gamut imposed by the trichromatic model. Opponent process color theories, which treat intensity and chroma as separate visual signals, provide a biophysical explanation of these chimerical colors.\n\nFor example, staring at a saturated primary-color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue, causing an afterimage of the complementary color. Exploration of the color space outside the range of \"real colors\" by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent-process theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and they are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors (e.g \"yellowish blue\").\n\n**Colors Outside Physical Color Space**\n\nAccording to the opponent-process theory, under normal circumstances, there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues; that is, as a hue looking \"redgreen\" or \"yellowblue.\" These colors are theoretically impossible to perceive, as they require a combination of cone cell responses that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances.\n\n**In Fiction**\n\nSome works of fiction have mentioned fictional colors outside of the normal human visual spectrum that have not been observed yet and whose observation may require advanced technology, different physics, or magic. Introduction of a new color is often an allegory intending to deliver additional information to the reader. Such colors are primarily discussed in literary works, as they are currently impossible to visualize (when a new color is shown in the episode \"Reincarnation\" of the animated show Futurama, the animation for that segment of the show is purposely kept in shades of gray).\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Color theory\n* Color opponent process\n* Chimerical colors\n* Imaginary colors\n* Color spaces\n\n**References**\n\n* CIE 1931 color space\n* Opponent process color theory\n* Chimerical colors\n* Imaginary colors\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* Color and Human Vision by David H.

{"title": "Republic_of_Ireland", "content": "\nName\nThe Irish name for Ireland is Éire, deriving from Ériu, a goddess in Irish mythology [21] The state created in 1922, comprising 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland, was \"styled and known as the Irish Free State\" (Saorstát Éireann) [22] The Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, says that \"the name of the State is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland\" Section 2 of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 states, \"It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.\" The 1948 Act does not name the state \"Republic of Ireland\", because to have done so would have put it in conflict with the Constitution [23]\n\n\nHistory\nFrom the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30% One million Irish died of starvation and disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States [31] This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s [32] [33] [34]\n\n\nHome-rule movement\nFrom the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30% One million Irish died of starvation and disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States [31] This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s [32] [33] [34]\n\n\nRevolution and steps to independence\nThough it received the Royal Assent and was placed on the statute books in 1914, the implementation of the Third Home Rule Act was suspended until after the First World War which defused the threat of civil war in Ireland With the hope of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war through Ireland's engagement in the war, Redmond and the Irish National Volunteers supported the UK and its Allies 175,000 men joined Irish regiments of the 10th (Irish) and 16th (Irish) divisions of the New British Army, while Unionists joined the 36th (Ulster) divisions [37]\n\n\nIrish Civil War\nThe Irish Civil War (June 1922 – May 1923) was the consequence of the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the creation of the Irish Free State [41] Anti-treaty forces, led by Éamon de Valera, objected to the fact that acceptance of the treaty abolished the Irish Republic of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the \"people have no right to do wrong\" [42] They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the British Empire and that members of the Free State Parliament would have to swear what the anti-treaty side saw as an oath of fidelity to the British king Pro-treaty forces, led by Michael Collins, argued that the treaty gave \"not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it\" [43]\n\n\nConstitution of Ireland 1937\nFollowing a national plebiscite in July 1937, the new Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht na hÉireann) came into force on 29 December 1937 [44] This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and declared that the name of the state is Éire, or \"Ireland\" in the English language [45] While Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution defined the national territory to be the whole island, they also confined the state's jurisdiction to the area that had been the Irish Free State The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936 Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open Diplomats were accredited to the king, but the president exercised all internal functions of a head of state [46] For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI who was only an \"organ\", that was provided for by statute law.\n\n\nRecent history\nIreland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955, after having been denied membership because of its neutral stance during the Second World War and not supporting the Allied cause [51] At the time, joining the UN involved a commitment to using force to deter aggression by one state against another if the UN thought it was necessary [52]\n\n\nGeography\nThe state extends over an area of about five-sixths (70,273 km2 or 27,133 sq mi) of the island of Ireland (84,421 km2 or 32,595 sq mi), with Northern Ireland constituting the remainder The island is bounded to the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the northeast by the North Channel To the east, the Irish Sea connects to the Atlantic Ocean via St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Atlantic Ocean and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream affect weather patterns in Ireland [70] Temperatures differ regionally, with central and eastern areas tending to be more extreme However, due to a temperate oceanic climate, temperatures are seldom lower than −5 °C (23 °F) in winter or higher than 26 °C (79 °F) in summer [71] The highest temperature recorded in Ireland was 33.3 °C (91.9 °F) on 26 June 1887 at Kilkenny Castle in Kilkenny, while the lowest temperature recorded was −19.1 °C (−2.4 °F) at Markree Castle in Sligo [72] Rainfall is more prevalent during winter months and less so during the early months of summer Southwestern areas experience the most rainfall as a result of south westerly winds, while Dublin receives the least Sunshine duration is highest in the southeast of the country [70] The far north and west are two of the windiest regions in Europe, with great potential for wind energy generation [73]\n\n\nPolitics\nIreland is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary system of government The Oireachtas is the bicameral national parliament composed of the President of Ireland and the two Houses of the Oireachtas: Dáil Éireann (House of Representatives) and Seanad Éireann (Senate) [75] Áras an Uachtaráin is the official residence of the President of Ireland, while the houses of the Oireachtas meet at Leinster House in Dublin.\n\n\nLocal government\nThe Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 was the founding statute of the present system of local government, while the Twentieth Amendment to the constitution of 1999 provided for its constitutional recognition The twenty-six traditional counties of Ireland are the basis of the local government areas, with the traditional counties of Cork, Dublin and Galway containing two or more local government areas The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, [80] provides for a system of thirty-one local authorities – twenty-six county councils, two city and county councils, and three city councils [80] Counties (with the exception of the three counties in Dublin) are divided into municipal districts A second local government tier of town councils was abolished in 2014.\n\n\nLaw\nIreland has a common law legal system with a written constitution that provides for a parliamentary democracy The court system consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court, all of which apply the Irish law and hear both civil and criminal matters Trials for serious offences must usually be held before a jury The High Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have authority, by means of judicial review, to determine the compatibility of laws and activities of other institutions of the state with the constitution and the law Except in exceptional circumstances, court hearings must occur in public [81] [82]\n\n\nForeign relations\nForeign relations are substantially influenced by membership of the European Union, although bilateral relations with the United Kingdom and United States are also important [87] It held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on six occasions, most recently from January to June 2013 [88]\n\n\nMilitary\nIreland is a neutral country, [95] and has \"triple-lock\" rules governing the participation of Irish troops in conflict zones, whereby approval must be given by the UN, the Dáil and Government [96] Accordingly, its military role is limited to national self-defence and participation in United Nations peacekeeping.\n\n\nEconomy\nIreland is an open economy and ranks first for \"high-value\" foreign direct investment (FDI) flows [102] Ireland ranks 5th of 187 (IMF) and 6th of 175 (World Bank) in GDP per capita as well as ranking in the top ten for GNI per capita An alternative metric, known as modified Gross National Income (GNI), was created by the Central Statistics Office and is used by the Irish government to give a view of activity in the domestic economy after stripping out large multinational export movements which can often relate to intangible assets [103] This is particularly relevant in Ireland's economy, as GDP disproportionately includes income from non-Irish owned companies, which often flows out of Ireland [104] Foreign multinationals are the main driver of Ireland's economy, employing a quarter of the private sector workforce, [105] and paying 80% of Irish corporate taxes [106] [107] [108] 14 of Ireland's top 20 firms (by 2017 turnover) are US-based multinationals [109] and 80% of foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the US [110] [111] [109]\n\n\nTaxation policy\nThe transformation of Ireland's tax policy started with the creation of a 10% low-tax \"special economic zone\", called the International Financial Services Centre (or \"IFSC\"), in 1987 [132] In 1999, the entire country was effectively \"turned into an IFSC\" with the reduction of Irish corporation tax from 32% to 12.5% [133] [134] This accelerated the later stages of Ireland's transition from a predominantly agricultural economy into a knowledge and service economy initially focused on property and construction and later focused on attracting mainly US multinationals from high-tech, life sciences, and financial services industries seeking to avail of Ireland's low corporation tax rates and favourable corporate tax system.\n\n\nTrade\nAlthough multinational corporations dominate Ireland's export sector, exports from other sources also contribute significantly to the national income The activities of multinational companies based in Ireland have made it one of the largest exporters of pharmaceutical agents, medical devices and software-related goods and services in the world Ireland's exports also relate to the activities of large Irish companies (such as Ryanair, Kerry Group and Smurfit Kappa) and exports of mineral resources including zinc and lead concentrates The country also has significant deposits of gypsum and smaller quantities of copper, silver, gold, barite, and dolomite [69] Tourism in Ireland contributes about 4% of GDP and is a significant source of employment.\n\n\nEnergy\nESB, Bord Gáis Energy and Airtricity are the three main electricity and gas suppliers in Ireland There are 19.82 billion cubic metres of proven reserves of gas [69] [159] Natural gas extraction previously occurred at the Kinsale Head until its exhaustion The Corrib gas field was due to come on stream in 2013/14 In 2012, the Barryroe field was confirmed to have up to 1.6 billion barrels of oil in reserve, with between 160 and 600 million recoverable [160] That could provide for Ireland's entire energy needs for up to 13 years, when it is developed in 2015/16.\n\n\nTransport\nThe country's three main international airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork serve many European and intercontinental routes with scheduled and chartered flights The London to Dublin air route is the ninth busiest international air route in the world, and also the busiest international air route in Europe, with 14,500 flights between the two in 2017 [166] [167] In 2015, 4.5 million people took the route, at that time, the world's second-busiest [166] Aer Lingus is the flag carrier of Ireland, although Ryanair is the country's largest airline Ryanair is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, [168] the second largest in terms of passenger numbers, and the world's largest in terms of international passenger numbers [169]\n\n\nDemographics\nGenetic research suggests that the earliest settlers migrated from Iberia following the most recent ice age [173] After the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, migrants introduced a Celtic language and culture Migrants from the two latter eras still represent the genetic heritage of most Irish people [174] [175] Gaelic tradition expanded and became the dominant form over time Irish people are a combination of Gaelic, Norse, Anglo-Norman, French, and British ancestry.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Irish Constitution describes Irish as the \"national language\" and the \"first official language\", but English (the \"second official language\") is the dominant language In the 2016 census, about 1.75 million people (40% of the population) said they were able to speak Irish but, of those, under 74,000 spoke it on a daily basis [185] Irish is spoken as a community language only in a small number of rural areas mostly in the west and south of the country, collectively known as the Gaeltacht Except in Gaeltacht regions, road signs are usually bilingual [186] Most public notices and print media are in English only While the state is officially bilingual, citizens can often struggle to access state services in Irish and most government publications are not available in both languages, even though citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish Irish language media include the TV channel TG4, the radio station RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta and online newspaper Tuairisc.ie In the Irish Defence Forces, all foot and arms drill commands are given in the Irish language.\n\n\nHealthcare\nHealthcare in Ireland is provided by both public and private healthcare providers [190] The Minister for Health has responsibility for setting overall health service policy Every resident of Ireland is entitled to receive health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the Health Service Executive and funded by general taxation A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability All maternity services are provided free of charge and children up to the age of 6 months Emergency care is provided to patients who present to a hospital emergency department However, visitors to emergency departments in non-emergency situations who are not referred by their GP may incur a fee of €100 In some circumstances this fee is not payable or may be waived [191]\n\n\nEducation\nIreland has three levels of education: primary, secondary and higher education The education systems are largely under the direction of the Government via the Minister for Education Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by the relevant authorities Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fifteen years, and all children up to the age of eighteen must complete the first three years of secondary, including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination [196]\n\n\nReligion\nReligious freedom is constitutionally provided for in Ireland, and the country's constitution has been secular since 1973 Christianity is the predominant religion, and while Ireland remains a predominantly Catholic country, the percentage of the population who identified as Catholic on the census fell sharply from 84.2 percent in the 2011 census to 78.3 percent in 2016 and 69 percent in 2022 [206] [207] Other results from the 2016 census were: 4.2% Protestant, 1.3% Orthodox, 1.3% as Muslim, and 9.8% as having no religion [208] According to a Georgetown University study, before 2000 the country had one of the highest rates of regular mass attendance in the Western world [209]\nWhile daily attendance was 13% in 2006, there was a reduction in weekly attendance from 81% in 1990 to 48% in 2006; the decline was reported as stabilising, though [210] In 2011, it was reported that weekly mass attendance in Dublin was 18% and even lower among younger generations [211]\n\n\nCulture\nIreland's culture was for centuries predominantly Gaelic, and it remains one of the six principal Celtic nations Following the Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century, and gradual British conquest and colonisation beginning in the 16th century, Ireland became influenced by English and Scottish culture Subsequently, Irish culture, though distinct in many aspects, shares characteristics with the rest of the Anglosphere, Catholic Europe, and other Celtic regions The Irish diaspora, one of the world's largest and most dispersed, has contributed to the globalisation of Irish culture, producing many prominent figures in art, music, and science.\n\n\nLiterature\nIreland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages Modern Irish fiction began with the publishing of the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include Laurence Sterne with the publication of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including Maria Edgeworth, John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham, William Carleton, George Moore, and Somerville and Ross Bram Stoker is best known as the author of the 1897 novel Dracula.\n\n\nMusic and dance\nIrish traditional music has remained vibrant, despite globalising cultural forces, and retains many traditional aspects It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues Ireland's best selling musical act is the rock band U2, who have sold 170 million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976 [222]\n\n\nArchitecture\nIreland has a wealth of structures, [229] surviving in various states of preservation, from the Neolithic period, such as Brú na Bóinne, Poulnabrone dolmen, Castlestrange stone, Turoe stone, and Drombeg stone circle [230] As Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, ancient architecture in Greco-Roman style is extremely rare, in contrast to most of Western Europe The country instead had an extended period of Iron Age architecture [231] The Irish round tower originated during the Early Medieval period.\n\n\nMedia\nRaidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) is Ireland's public service broadcaster, funded by a television licence fee and advertising [248] RTÉ operates two national television channels, RTÉ One and RTÉ Two The other independent national television channels are Virgin Media One, Virgin Media Two, Virgin Media Three and TG4, the latter of which is a public service broadcaster for speakers of the Irish language All these channels are available on Saorview, the national free-to-air digital terrestrial television service [249] Additional channels included in the service are RTÉ News Now, RTÉjr, and RTÉ One +1 Subscription-based television providers operating in Ireland include Virgin Media and Sky.\n\n\nCuisine\nIrish cuisine was traditionally based on meat and dairy products, supplemented with vegetables and seafood.\nExamples of popular Irish cuisine include boxty, colcannon, coddle, stew, and bacon and cabbage Ireland is known for the full Irish breakfast, which involves a fried or grilled meal generally consisting of rashers, egg, sausage, white and black pudding, and fried tomato Apart from the influence by European and international dishes, there has been an emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways [253] This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country Shellfish have increased in popularity, especially due to the high quality shellfish available from the country's coastline The most popular fish include salmon and cod Traditional breads include soda bread and wheaten bread Barmbrack is a yeasted bread with added sultanas and raisins, traditionally eaten on Halloween [254]\n\n\nSports\nGaelic football and hurling are the traditional sports of Ireland as well as popular spectator sports [255] They are administered by the Gaelic Athletics Association on an all-Ireland basis Other Gaelic games organised by the association include Gaelic handball and rounders [256] Association football (soccer) is the third most popular spectator sport and has the highest level of participation [257] Although the League of Ireland is the national league, the English Premier League is the most popular among the public [258] The Republic of Ireland national football team plays at international level and is administered by the Football Association of Ireland [259]\n\n\nSociety\nIreland ranks fifth in the world in terms of gender equality [267] In 2011, Ireland was ranked the most charitable country in Europe, and second most charitable in the world [268] Contraception was controlled in Ireland until 1979, however, the receding influence of the Catholic Church has led to an increasingly secularised society [269] A constitutional ban on divorce was lifted following a referendum in 1995 Divorce rates in Ireland are very low compared to European Union averages (0.7 divorced people per 1,000 population in 2011) while the marriage rate in Ireland is slightly above the European Union average (4.6 marriages per 1,000 population per year in 2012) Abortion had been banned throughout the period of the Irish state, first through provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and later by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 The right to life of the unborn was protected in the constitution by the Eighth Amendment in 1983; this provision was removed following a referendum, and replaced it with a provision allowing legislation to regulate the termination of pregnancy The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 passed later that year provided for abortion generally during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and in specified circumstances after that date [270]\n\n\nState symbols\nThe state shares many symbols with the island of Ireland These include the colours green and blue, animals such as the Irish wolfhound and stags, structures such as round towers and celtic crosses, and designs such as Celtic knots and spirals The shamrock, a type of clover, has been a national symbol of Ireland since the 17th century when it became customary to wear it as a symbol on St Patrick's Day These symbols are used by state institutions as well as private bodies in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther

of Europe. It is a member of the European Union and has a population of approximately 4.9 million people. The country is known for its rich cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and vibrant economy.\n\n**Name**\nThe Irish name for Ireland is Éire, deriving from Ériu, a goddess in Irish mythology. The state created in 1922, comprising 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland, was \"styled and known as the Irish Free State\" (Saorstát Éireann). The Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, says that \"the name of the State is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland.\" Section 2 of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 states, \"It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.\" The 1948 Act does not name the state \"Republic of Ireland,\" because to have done so would have put it in conflict with the Constitution.\n\n**History**\nFrom the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. One million Irish died of starvation and disease, and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States. This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s.\n\n**Home-rule movement**\nFrom the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30%. One million Irish died of starvation and disease, and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States. This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s.\n\n**Revolution and steps to independence**\nThough it received the Royal Assent and was placed on the statute books in 1914, the implementation of the Third Home Rule Act was suspended until after the First World War, which defused the threat of civil war in Ireland. With the hope of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war through Ireland's engagement in the war, Redmond and the Irish National Volunteers supported the UK and its Allies. 175,000 men joined Irish regiments of the 10th (Irish) and 16th (Irish) divisions of the New British Army, while Unionists joined the 36th (Ulster) divisions.\n\n**Irish Civil War**\nThe Irish Civil War (June 1922 – May 1923) was the consequence of the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-treaty forces, led by Éamon de Valera, objected to the fact that acceptance of the treaty abolished the Irish Republic of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the \"people have no right to do wrong.\" They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the British Empire and that members of the Free State Parliament would have to swear what the anti-treaty side saw as an oath of fidelity to the British king. Pro-treaty forces, led by Michael Collins, argued that the treaty gave \"not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it.\"\n\n**Constitution of Ireland 1937**\nFollowing a national plebiscite in July 1937, the new Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht na hÉireann) came into force on 29 December 1937. This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and declared that the name of the state is Éire, or \"Ireland\" in the English language. While Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution defined the national territory to be the whole island, they also confined the state's jurisdiction to the area that had been the Irish Free State. The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936. Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open. Diplomats were accredited to the king, but the president exercised all internal functions of a head of state. For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI who was only an \"organ,\" that was provided for by statute law.\n\n**Recent history**\nIreland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955, after having been denied membership because of its neutral stance during the Second World War and not supporting the Allied cause. At the time, joining the UN involved a commitment to using force to deter aggression by one state against another if the UN thought it was necessary.\n\n**Geography**\nThe state extends over an area of about five-sixths (70,273 km2 or 27,133 sq mi) of the island of Ireland (84,421 km2 or 32,595 sq mi), with Northern Ireland constituting the remainder. The island is bounded to the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the northeast by the North Channel. To the east, the Irish Sea connects to the Atlantic Ocean via St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest.\n\n**Climate**\nThe Atlantic Ocean and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream affect weather patterns in Ireland. Temperatures differ regionally, with central and eastern areas tending to be more extreme. However, due to a temperate oceanic climate, temperatures are seldom lower than −5 °C (23 °F) in winter or higher than 26 °C (79 °F) in summer. The highest temperature recorded in Ireland was 33.3 °C (91.9 °F) on 26 June 1887 at Kilkenny Castle in Kilkenny, while the lowest temperature recorded was −19.1 °C (−2.4 °F) at Markree Castle in Sligo. Rainfall is more prevalent during winter months and less so during the early months of summer. Southwestern areas experience the most rainfall as a result of south westerly winds, while Dublin receives the least. Sunshine duration is highest in the southeast of the country. The far north and west are two of the windiest regions in Europe, with great potential for wind energy generation.\n\n**Politics**\nIreland is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary system of government. The Oireachtas is the bicameral national parliament composed of the President of Ireland and the two Houses of the Oireachtas: Dáil Éireann (House of Representatives) and Seanad Éireann (Senate). Áras an Uachtaráin is the official residence of the President of Ireland, while the houses of the Oireachtas meet at Leinster House in Dublin.\n\n**Local government**\nThe Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 was the founding statute of the present system of local government, while the Twentieth Amendment to the constitution of 1999 provided for its constitutional recognition. The twenty-six traditional counties of Ireland are the basis of the local government areas, with the traditional counties of Cork, Dublin, and Galway containing two or more local government areas. Counties (with the exception of the three counties in Dublin) are divided into municipal districts. A second local government tier of town councils was abolished in 2014.\n\n**Law**\nIreland has a common law legal system with a written constitution that provides for a parliamentary democracy. The court system consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court, and the District Court, all of which apply the Irish law and hear both civil and criminal matters. Trials for serious offences must usually be held before a jury. The High Court, Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court have authority, by means of judicial review, to determine the compatibility of laws and activities of other institutions of the state with the constitution and the law. Except in exceptional circumstances, court hearings must occur in public.\n\n**Foreign relations**\nForeign relations are substantially influenced by membership of the European Union, although bilateral relations with the United Kingdom and the United States are also important. Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on six occasions, most recently from January to June 2013.\n\n**Military**\nIreland is a neutral country, and has \"triple-lock\" rules governing the participation of Irish troops in conflict zones, whereby approval must be given by the UN, the Dáil, and the Government. Accordingly, its military role is limited to national self-defence and participation in United Nations peacekeeping.\n\n**Economy**\nIreland is an open economy and ranks first for \"high-value\" foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. Ireland ranks 5th of 187 (IMF) and 6th of 175 (World Bank) in GDP per capita, as well as ranking in the top ten for GNI per capita. An alternative metric, known as modified Gross National Income (GNI), was created by the Central Statistics Office and is used by the Irish government to give a view of activity in the domestic economy after stripping out large multinational export movements which can often relate to intangible assets. This is particularly relevant in Ireland's economy, as GDP disproportionately includes income from non-Irish owned companies, which often flows out of Ireland. Foreign multinationals are the main driver of Ireland's economy, employing a quarter of the private sector workforce, and paying 80% of Irish corporate taxes. 14 of Ireland's top 20 firms (by 2017 turnover) are US-based multinationals, and 80% of foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the US.\n\n**Taxation policy**\nThe transformation of Ireland's tax policy started with the creation of a 10% low-tax \"special economic zone\", called the International Financial Services Centre (or \"IFSC\"), in 1987. In 1999, the entire country was effectively \"turned into an IFSC\" with the reduction of Irish corporation tax from 32% to 12.5%. This accelerated the later stages of Ireland's transition from a predominantly agricultural economy into a knowledge and service economy, initially focused on property and construction, and later focused on attracting mainly US multinationals from high-tech, life sciences, and financial services industries seeking to avail of Ireland's low corporation tax rates and favourable corporate tax system.\n\n**Trade**\nAlthough multinational corporations dominate Ireland's export sector, exports from other sources also contribute significantly to the national income. The activities of multinational companies based in Ireland have made it one of the largest exporters of pharmaceutical agents, medical devices, and software-related goods and services in the world. Ireland's exports also relate to the activities of large Irish companies (such as Ryanair, Kerry Group, and Smurfit Kappa) and exports of mineral resources, including zinc and lead concentrates. The country also has significant deposits of gypsum and smaller quantities of copper, silver, gold, barite, and dolomite. Tourism in Ireland contributes about 4% of GDP and is a significant source of employment.\n\n**Energy**\nESB, Bord Gáis Energy, and Airtricity are the three main electricity and gas suppliers in Ireland. There are 19.82 billion cubic metres of proven reserves of gas. Natural gas extraction previously occurred at the Kinsale Head until its exhaustion. The Corrib gas field was due to come on stream in 2013/14. In 2012, the Barryroe field was confirmed to have up to 1.6 billion barrels of oil in reserve, with between 160 and 600 million recoverable. This could provide for Ireland's entire energy needs for up to 13 years, when it is developed in 2015/16.\n\n**Transport**\nThe country's three main international airports at Dublin, Shannon, and Cork serve many European and intercontinental routes with scheduled and chartered flights. The London to Dublin air route is the ninth busiest international air route in the world, and also the busiest international air route in Europe, with 14,500 flights between the two in 2017. In 2015, 4.5 million people took the route, at that time, the world's second-busiest. Aer Lingus is the flag carrier of Ireland, although Ryanair is the country's largest airline. Ryanair is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, the second largest in terms of passenger numbers, and the world's largest in terms of international passenger numbers.\n\n**Demographics**\nGenetic research suggests that the earliest settlers migrated from Iberia following the most recent ice age. After the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, migrants introduced a Celtic language and culture. Migrants from the two latter eras still represent the genetic heritage of most Irish people. Gaelic tradition expanded and became the dominant form over time. Irish people are a combination of Gaelic, Norse, Anglo-Norman, French, and British ancestry.\n\n**Languages**\nThe Irish Constitution describes Irish as the \"national language\" and the \"first official language,\" but English (the \"second official language\") is the dominant language. In the 2016 census, about 1.75 million people (40% of the population) said they were able to speak Irish, but, of those, under 74,000 spoke it on a daily basis. Irish is spoken as a community language only in a small number of rural areas mostly in the west and south of the country, collectively known as the Gaeltacht. Except in Gaeltacht regions, road signs are usually bilingual. Most public notices and print media are in English only. While the state is officially bilingual, citizens can often struggle to access state services in Irish, and most government publications are not available in both languages, even though citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish. Irish language media include the TV channel TG4, the radio station RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, and online newspaper Tuairisc.ie. In the Irish Defence Forces, all foot and arms drill commands are given in the Irish language.\n\n**Healthcare**\nHealthcare in Ireland is provided by both public and private healthcare providers. The Minister for Health has responsibility for setting overall health service policy. Every resident of Ireland is entitled to receive healthcare through the public healthcare system, which is managed by the Health Service Executive and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain healthcare received; this depends on income, age, illness, or disability. All maternity services are provided free of charge, and children up to the age of six months. Emergency care is provided to patients who present to a hospital emergency department. However, visitors to emergency departments in non-emergency situations who are not referred by their GP may incur a fee of €100. In some circumstances, this fee is not payable or may be waived.\n\n**Education**\nIreland has three levels of education: primary, secondary, and higher education. The education systems are largely under the direction of the Government via the Minister for Education. Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by the relevant authorities. Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fifteen years, and all children up to the age of eighteen must complete the first three years of secondary, including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination.\n\n**Religion**\nReligious freedom is constitutionally provided for in Ireland, and the country has been secular since 1973.

Subsequently, Irish culture, though distinct in many aspects, shares characteristics with the rest of the Anglosphere, Catholic Europe, and other Celtic regions. The Irish diaspora, one of the world's largest and most dispersed, has contributed to the globalisation of Irish culture, producing many prominent figures in art, music, and science.\n\n**Literature**\nIreland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages. Modern Irish fiction began with the publishing of the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift. Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include Laurence Sterne with the publication of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield. Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including Maria Edgeworth, John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham, William Carleton, George Moore, and Somerville and Ross. Bram Stoker is best known as the author of the 1897 novel Dracula.\n\n**Music and dance**\nIrish traditional music has remained vibrant, despite globalising cultural forces, and retains many traditional aspects. It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock. Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues. Ireland's best-selling musical act is the rock band U2, who have sold 170 million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976.\n\n**Architecture**\nIreland has a wealth of structures, surviving in various states of preservation, from the Neolithic period, such as Brú na Bóinne, Poulnabrone dolmen, Castlestrange stone, Turoe stone, and Drombeg stone circle. As Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, ancient architecture in Greco-Roman style is extremely rare, in contrast to most of Western Europe. The country instead had an extended period of Iron Age architecture. The Irish round tower originated during the Early Medieval period.\n\n**Media**\nRaidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) is Ireland's public service broadcaster, funded by a television licence fee and advertising. RTÉ operates two national television channels, RTÉ One and RTÉ Two. The other independent national television channels are Virgin Media One, Virgin Media Two, Virgin Media Three, and TG4, the latter of which is a public service broadcaster for speakers of the Irish language. All these channels are available on Saorview, the national free-to-air digital terrestrial television service. Additional channels included in the service are RTÉ News Now, RTÉjr, and RTÉ One +1. Subscription-based television", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Republic_of_Ireland\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe Irish name for Ireland is Éire, deriving from Ériu, a goddess in Irish mythology [21] The state created in 1922, comprising 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland, was \"styled and known as the Irish Free State\" (Saorstát Éireann) [22] The Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, says that \"the name of the State is Éire, or, in the English language, Ireland\" Section 2 of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 states, \"It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.\" The 1948 Act does not name the state \"Republic of Ireland\", because to have done so would have put it in conflict with the Constitution [23]\n\n\nHistory\nFrom the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30% One million Irish died of starvation and disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States [31] This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s [32] [33] [34]\n\n\nHome-rule movement\nFrom the Act of Union on 1 January 1801, until 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland During the Great Famine, from 1845 to 1849, the island's population of over 8 million fell by 30% One million Irish died of starvation and disease and another 1.5 million emigrated, mostly to the United States [31] This set the pattern of emigration for the century to come, resulting in constant population decline up to the 1960s [32] [33] [34]\n\n\nRevolution and steps to independence\nThough it received the Royal Assent and was placed on the statute books in 1914, the implementation of the Third Home Rule Act was suspended until after the First World War which defused the threat of civil war in Ireland With the hope of ensuring the implementation of the Act at the end of the war through Ireland's engagement in the war, Redmond and the Irish National Volunteers supported the UK and its Allies 175,000 men joined Irish regiments of the 10th (Irish) and 16th (Irish) divisions of the New British Army, while Unionists joined the 36th (Ulster) divisions [37]\n\n\nIrish Civil War\nThe Irish Civil War (June 1922 – May 1923) was the consequence of the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the creation of the Irish Free State [41] Anti-treaty forces, led by Éamon de Valera, objected to the fact that acceptance of the treaty abolished the Irish Republic of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the \"people have no right to do wrong\" [42] They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the British Empire and that members of the Free State Parliament would have to swear what the anti-treaty side saw as an oath of fidelity to the British king Pro-treaty forces, led by Michael Collins, argued that the treaty gave \"not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it\" [43]\n\n\nConstitution of Ireland 1937\nFollowing a national plebiscite in July 1937, the new Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht na hÉireann) came into force on 29 December 1937 [44] This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and declared that the name of the state is Éire, or \"Ireland\" in the English language [45] While Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution defined the national territory to be the whole island, they also confined the state's jurisdiction to the area that had been the Irish Free State The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936 Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open Diplomats were accredited to the king, but the president exercised all internal functions of a head of state [46] For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI who was only an \"organ\", that was provided for by statute law.\n\n\nRecent history\nIreland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955, after having been denied membership because of its neutral stance during the Second World War and not supporting the Allied cause [51] At the time, joining the UN involved a commitment to using force to deter aggression by one state against another if the UN thought it was necessary [52]\n\n\nGeography\nThe state extends over an area of about five-sixths (70,273 km2 or 27,133 sq mi) of the island of Ireland (84,421 km2 or 32,595 sq mi), with Northern Ireland constituting the remainder The island is bounded to the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the northeast by the North Channel To the east, the Irish Sea connects to the Atlantic Ocean via St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Atlantic Ocean and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream affect weather patterns in Ireland [70] Temperatures differ regionally, with central and eastern areas tending to be more extreme However, due to a temperate oceanic climate, temperatures are seldom lower than −5 °C (23 °F) in winter or higher than 26 °C (79 °F) in summer [71] The highest temperature recorded in Ireland was 33.3 °C (91.9 °F) on 26 June 1887 at Kilkenny Castle in Kilkenny, while the lowest temperature recorded was −19.1 °C (−2.4 °F) at Markree Castle in Sligo [72] Rainfall is more prevalent during winter months and less so during the early months of summer Southwestern areas experience the most rainfall as a result of south westerly winds, while Dublin receives the least Sunshine duration is highest in the southeast of the country [70] The far north and west are two of the windiest regions in Europe, with great potential for wind energy generation [73]\n\n\nPolitics\nIreland is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary system of government The Oireachtas is the bicameral national parliament composed of the President of Ireland and the two Houses of the Oireachtas: Dáil Éireann (House of Representatives) and Seanad Éireann (Senate) [75] Áras an Uachtaráin is the official residence of the President of Ireland, while the houses of the Oireachtas meet at Leinster House in Dublin.\n\n\nLocal government\nThe Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 was the founding statute of the present system of local government, while the Twentieth Amendment to the constitution of 1999 provided for its constitutional recognition The twenty-six traditional counties of Ireland are the basis of the local government areas, with the traditional counties of Cork, Dublin and Galway containing two or more local government areas The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, [80] provides for a system of thirty-one local authorities – twenty-six county councils, two city and county councils, and three city councils [80] Counties (with the exception of the three counties in Dublin) are divided into municipal districts A second local government tier of town councils was abolished in 2014.\n\n\nLaw\nIreland has a common law legal system with a written constitution that provides for a parliamentary democracy The court system consists of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court, all of which apply the Irish law and hear both civil and criminal matters Trials for serious offences must usually be held before a jury The High Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have authority, by means of judicial review, to determine the compatibility of laws and activities of other institutions of the state with the constitution and the law Except in exceptional circumstances, court hearings must occur in public [81] [82]\n\n\nForeign relations\nForeign relations are substantially influenced by membership of the European Union, although bilateral relations with the United Kingdom and United States are also important [87] It held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on six occasions, most recently from January to June 2013 [88]\n\n\nMilitary\nIreland is a neutral country, [95] and has \"triple-lock\" rules governing the participation of Irish troops in conflict zones, whereby approval must be given by the UN, the Dáil and Government [96] Accordingly, its military role is limited to national self-defence and participation in United Nations peacekeeping.\n\n\nEconomy\nIreland is an open economy and ranks first for \"high-value\" foreign direct investment (FDI) flows [102] Ireland ranks 5th of 187 (IMF) and 6th of 175 (World Bank) in GDP per capita as well as ranking in the top ten for GNI per capita An alternative metric, known as modified Gross National Income (GNI), was created by the Central Statistics Office and is used by the Irish government to give a view of activity in the domestic economy after stripping out large multinational export movements which can often relate to intangible assets [103] This is particularly relevant in Ireland's economy, as GDP disproportionately includes income from non-Irish owned companies, which often flows out of Ireland [104] Foreign multinationals are the main driver of Ireland's economy, employing a quarter of the private sector workforce, [105] and paying 80% of Irish corporate taxes [106] [107] [108] 14 of Ireland's top 20 firms (by 2017 turnover) are US-based multinationals [109] and 80% of foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the US [110] [111] [109]\n\n\nTaxation policy\nThe transformation of Ireland's tax policy started with the creation of a 10% low-tax \"special economic zone\", called the International Financial Services Centre (or \"IFSC\"), in 1987 [132] In 1999, the entire country was effectively \"turned into an IFSC\" with the reduction of Irish corporation tax from 32% to 12.5% [133] [134] This accelerated the later stages of Ireland's transition from a predominantly agricultural economy into a knowledge and service economy initially focused on property and construction and later focused on attracting mainly US multinationals from high-tech, life sciences, and financial services industries seeking to avail of Ireland's low corporation tax rates and favourable corporate tax system.\n\n\nTrade\nAlthough multinational corporations dominate Ireland's export sector, exports from other sources also contribute significantly to the national income The activities of multinational companies based in Ireland have made it one of the largest exporters of pharmaceutical agents, medical devices and software-related goods and services in the world Ireland's exports also relate to the activities of large Irish companies (such as Ryanair, Kerry Group and Smurfit Kappa) and exports of mineral resources including zinc and lead concentrates The country also has significant deposits of gypsum and smaller quantities of copper, silver, gold, barite, and dolomite [69] Tourism in Ireland contributes about 4% of GDP and is a significant source of employment.\n\n\nEnergy\nESB, Bord Gáis Energy and Airtricity are the three main electricity and gas suppliers in Ireland There are 19.82 billion cubic metres of proven reserves of gas [69] [159] Natural gas extraction previously occurred at the Kinsale Head until its exhaustion The Corrib gas field was due to come on stream in 2013/14 In 2012, the Barryroe field was confirmed to have up to 1.6 billion barrels of oil in reserve, with between 160 and 600 million recoverable [160] That could provide for Ireland's entire energy needs for up to 13 years, when it is developed in 2015/16.\n\n\nTransport\nThe country's three main international airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork serve many European and intercontinental routes with scheduled and chartered flights The London to Dublin air route is the ninth busiest international air route in the world, and also the busiest international air route in Europe, with 14,500 flights between the two in 2017 [166] [167] In 2015, 4.5 million people took the route, at that time, the world's second-busiest [166] Aer Lingus is the flag carrier of Ireland, although Ryanair is the country's largest airline Ryanair is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, [168] the second largest in terms of passenger numbers, and the world's largest in terms of international passenger numbers [169]\n\n\nDemographics\nGenetic research suggests that the earliest settlers migrated from Iberia following the most recent ice age [173] After the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, migrants introduced a Celtic language and culture Migrants from the two latter eras still represent the genetic heritage of most Irish people [174] [175] Gaelic tradition expanded and became the dominant form over time Irish people are a combination of Gaelic, Norse, Anglo-Norman, French, and British ancestry.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Irish Constitution describes Irish as the \"national language\" and the \"first official language\", but English (the \"second official language\") is the dominant language In the 2016 census, about 1.75 million people (40% of the population) said they were able to speak Irish but, of those, under 74,000 spoke it on a daily basis [185] Irish is spoken as a community language only in a small number of rural areas mostly in the west and south of the country, collectively known as the Gaeltacht Except in Gaeltacht regions, road signs are usually bilingual [186] Most public notices and print media are in English only While the state is officially bilingual, citizens can often struggle to access state services in Irish and most government publications are not available in both languages, even though citizens have the right to deal with the state in Irish Irish language media include the TV channel TG4, the radio station RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta and online newspaper Tuairisc.ie In the Irish Defence Forces, all foot and arms drill commands are given in the Irish language.\n\n\nHealthcare\nHealthcare in Ireland is provided by both public and private healthcare providers [190] The Minister for Health has responsibility for setting overall health service policy Every resident of Ireland is entitled to receive health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the Health Service Executive and funded by general taxation A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability All maternity services are provided free of charge and children up to the age of 6 months Emergency care is provided to patients who present to a hospital emergency department However, visitors to emergency departments in non-emergency situations who are not referred by their GP may incur a fee of €100 In some circumstances this fee is not payable or may be waived [191]\n\n\nEducation\nIreland has three levels of education: primary, secondary and higher education The education systems are largely under the direction of the Government via the Minister for Education Recognised primary and secondary schools must adhere to the curriculum established by the relevant authorities Education is compulsory between the ages of six and fifteen years, and all children up to the age of eighteen must complete the first three years of secondary, including one sitting of the Junior Certificate examination [196]\n\n\nReligion\nReligious freedom is constitutionally provided for in Ireland, and the country's constitution has been secular since 1973 Christianity is the predominant religion, and while Ireland remains a predominantly Catholic country, the percentage of the population who identified as Catholic on the census fell sharply from 84.2 percent in the 2011 census to 78.3 percent in 2016 and 69 percent in 2022 [206] [207] Other results from the 2016 census were: 4.2% Protestant, 1.3% Orthodox, 1.3% as Muslim, and 9.8% as having no religion [208] According to a Georgetown University study, before 2000 the country had one of the highest rates of regular mass attendance in the Western world [209]\nWhile daily attendance was 13% in 2006, there was a reduction in weekly attendance from 81% in 1990 to 48% in 2006; the decline was reported as stabilising, though [210] In 2011, it was reported that weekly mass attendance in Dublin was 18% and even lower among younger generations [211]\n\n\nCulture\nIreland's culture was for centuries predominantly Gaelic, and it remains one of the six principal Celtic nations Following the Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century, and gradual British conquest and colonisation beginning in the 16th century, Ireland became influenced by English and Scottish culture Subsequently, Irish culture, though distinct in many aspects, shares characteristics with the rest of the Anglosphere, Catholic Europe, and other Celtic regions The Irish diaspora, one of the world's largest and most dispersed, has contributed to the globalisation of Irish culture, producing many prominent figures in art, music, and science.\n\n\nLiterature\nIreland has made a significant contribution to world literature in both the English and Irish languages Modern Irish fiction began with the publishing of the 1726 novel Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift Other writers of importance during the 18th century and their most notable works include Laurence Sterne with the publication of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman and Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield Numerous Irish novelists emerged during the 19th century, including Maria Edgeworth, John Banim, Gerald Griffin, Charles Kickham, William Carleton, George Moore, and Somerville and Ross Bram Stoker is best known as the author of the 1897 novel Dracula.\n\n\nMusic and dance\nIrish traditional music has remained vibrant, despite globalising cultural forces, and retains many traditional aspects It has influenced various music genres, such as American country and roots music, and to some extent modern rock It has occasionally been blended with styles such as rock and roll and punk rock Ireland has also produced many internationally known artists in other genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, and blues Ireland's best selling musical act is the rock band U2, who have sold 170 million copies of their albums worldwide since their formation in 1976 [222]\n\n\nArchitecture\nIreland has a wealth of structures, [229] surviving in various states of preservation, from the Neolithic period, such as Brú na Bóinne, Poulnabrone dolmen, Castlestrange stone, Turoe stone, and Drombeg stone circle [230] As Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, ancient architecture in Greco-Roman style is extremely rare, in contrast to most of Western Europe The country instead had an extended period of Iron Age architecture [231] The Irish round tower originated during the Early Medieval period.\n\n\nMedia\nRaidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) is Ireland's public service broadcaster, funded by a television licence fee and advertising [248] RTÉ operates two national television channels, RTÉ One and RTÉ Two The other independent national television channels are Virgin Media One, Virgin Media Two, Virgin Media Three and TG4, the latter of which is a public service broadcaster for speakers of the Irish language All these channels are available on Saorview, the national free-to-air digital terrestrial television service [249] Additional channels included in the service are RTÉ News Now, RTÉjr, and RTÉ One +1 Subscription-based television providers operating in Ireland include Virgin Media and Sky.\n\n\nCuisine\nIrish cuisine was traditionally based on meat and dairy products, supplemented with vegetables and seafood.\nExamples of popular Irish cuisine include boxty, colcannon, coddle, stew, and bacon and cabbage Ireland is known for the full Irish breakfast, which involves a fried or grilled meal generally consisting of rashers, egg, sausage, white and black pudding, and fried tomato Apart from the influence by European and international dishes, there has been an emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways [253] This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish, oysters, mussels and other shellfish, and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country Shellfish have increased in popularity, especially due to the high quality shellfish available from the country's coastline The most popular fish include salmon and cod Traditional breads include soda bread and wheaten bread Barmbrack is a yeasted bread with added sultanas and raisins, traditionally eaten on Halloween [254]\n\n\nSports\nGaelic football and hurling are the traditional sports of Ireland as well as popular spectator sports [255] They are administered by the Gaelic Athletics Association on an all-Ireland basis Other Gaelic games organised by the association include Gaelic handball and rounders [256] Association football (soccer) is the third most popular spectator sport and has the highest level of participation [257] Although the League of Ireland is the national league, the English Premier League is the most popular among the public [258] The Republic of Ireland national football team plays at international level and is administered by the Football Association of Ireland [259]\n\n\nSociety\nIreland ranks fifth in the world in terms of gender equality [267] In 2011, Ireland was ranked the most charitable country in Europe, and second most charitable in the world [268] Contraception was controlled in Ireland until 1979, however, the receding influence of the Catholic Church has led to an increasingly secularised society [269] A constitutional ban on divorce was lifted following a referendum in 1995 Divorce rates in Ireland are very low compared to European Union averages (0.7 divorced people per 1,000 population in 2011) while the marriage rate in Ireland is slightly above the European Union average (4.6 marriages per 1,000 population per year in 2012) Abortion had been banned throughout the period of the Irish state, first through provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and later by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 The right to life of the unborn was protected in the constitution by the Eighth Amendment in 1983; this provision was removed following a referendum, and replaced it with a provision allowing legislation to regulate the termination of pregnancy The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 passed later that year provided for abortion generally during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and in specified circumstances after that date [270]\n\n\nState symbols\nThe state shares many symbols with the island of Ireland These include the colours green and blue, animals such as the Irish wolfhound and stags, structures such as round towers and celtic crosses, and designs such as Celtic knots and spirals The shamrock, a type of clover, has been a national symbol of Ireland since the 17th century when it became customary to wear it as a symbol on St Patrick's Day These symbols are used by state institutions as well as private bodies in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Daniel_Day-Lewis", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nDaniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis was born on 29 April 1957 in Kensington, London, the second child of the poet Cecil Day-Lewis (1904–1972) and his second wife, actress Jill Balcon (1925–2009) His older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis (born 1953), is a television chef and food critic [12] His father, who was born in the Irish town of Ballintubbert, County Laois, was of Protestant Anglo-Irish descent, lived in England from age two, and was appointed Poet Laureate in 1968 [13] Day-Lewis's mother was Jewish; her Ashkenazi Jewish ancestors were immigrants to England in the late 19th century, from Latvia and Poland [14] [15] [16] [17] Day-Lewis's maternal grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, became the head of Ealing Studios, helping develop the new British film industry [18] The BAFTA for Outstanding Contribution to British Cinema is presented every year in honour of Balcon's memory [19]\n\n\nCareer\nDuring the early 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and television, including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC Eleven years after his film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character In late 1982, he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in Another Country, which premiered in late 1981 Next, he took on a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal, first mate in The Bounty (1984) He next joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream [25]\n\n\n1980s\nDuring the early 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and television, including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC Eleven years after his film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character In late 1982, he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in Another Country, which premiered in late 1981 Next, he took on a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal, first mate in The Bounty (1984) He next joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream [25]\n\n\n1990s\nDay-Lewis starred in the American film The Last of the Mohicans (1992), based on a novel by James Fenimore Cooper Day-Lewis's character research for this film was well-publicised; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting, and fishing [25] Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills, and learned how to make canoes [42] He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character [25] [43]\n\n\n2000s\nAfter a three-year absence from acting on screen, Day-Lewis returned to film by reuniting with Martin Scorsese for Gangs of New York (2002) He took on the role of villainous gang leader William \"Bill the Butcher\" Cutting, starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Bill's young protégé as well as Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C Reilly, Brendan Gleeson, and Liam Neeson To help him get into character, he hired circus performers to teach him to throw knives [34] While filming, he was never out of character between takes (including keeping his character's New York accent) [25] At one point during filming, having been diagnosed with pneumonia, he refused to wear a warmer coat, or to take treatment, because it was not in keeping with the period; he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment [34] The film divided critics while Day-Lewis received plaudits for his portrayal of Bill the Butcher Rotten Tomatoes's critical consensus reads, \"Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance.\" [53] It earned Day-Lewis his third Oscar nomination, and won him his second BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role [54]\n\n\n2010s\nDay-Lewis portrayed Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's biopic Lincoln (2012) [64] Based on the book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film began shooting in Richmond, Virginia, in October 2011 [65] Day-Lewis spent a year in preparation for the role, a time he had requested from Spielberg [66] He read over 100 books on Lincoln, and long worked with the make-up artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln Speaking in Lincoln's voice throughout the entire shoot, Day-Lewis asked the British crew members who shared his native accent not to chat with him [3] Spielberg said of Day-Lewis's portrayal, \"I never once looked the gift horse in the mouth I never asked Daniel about his process I didn't want to know.\" [39] Lincoln received critical acclaim, especially for Day-Lewis's performance It also became a commercial success, grossing over $275 million worldwide [67] In November 2012, he received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film [68] The same month, Day-Lewis featured on the cover of Time magazine as the \"World's Greatest Actor\" [69]\n\n\n2020s\nOn 1 October 2024, after a seven-year absence, it was announced that

after Randver's death (Denmark according to the Hervarar saga), presumably as the subking of Harald Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland, where Harald and many of his men died Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king Sigfred who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804) He sired a son with the princess Alfhild of the petty kingdom of Álfheimr, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him [9] Eysteinn Beli, who according to the Hervarar Saga was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and Aslaug [10]\n\n\nDanish sources\nThe Chronicon Roskildense (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the Franks Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of Britain, though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas [16] The chronicle of Sven Aggesen (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne Their son in turn is Knut, ancestor of the later Danish kings [17]\n\n\nPoetic and epigraphic sources\nWhile the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin The Ragnarsdrápa, ostensibly composed by Bragi Boddason in the 9th century, praises a Ragnar, son of Sigurd, for a richly decorated shield that the poet has received The shield depicts the assault on Jörmunrek, the Hjaðningavíg tale, the ploughing of Gefjon, and Thor's struggle with the Midgard Serpent Recent scholarship has suggested that the poem is in fact from c 1000 and celebrates the Norse reconquest of England The four tales depicted on the shield would then symbolize four aspects of the Lodbrok saga (the initial defeat of the sons of Lodbrok in England due to recklessness, Ivar the Boneless's deceitful approach to King Ælla, Ivar's cunning snatching of land from Ælla, Ragnar's struggle against the giant serpent in order to win Thora) [30] The Knutsdrapa of Sigvat Thordarson (c 1038) mentions the death of Ælla at the hands of Ivar in York, who \"carved the eagle on Ælla's back\" [31] From this the story of the atrocious revenge of Lodbrok's sons already seems to be present The reference to a \"blood eagle\" punishment has however been much debated by modern scholars [32] Another lay, Krakumal, put in the mouth of the dying Ragnar in the snake pit, recounts the exploits of Ragnar and mentions battles over a wide geographical area, several relating to the British isles The poem's name, \"Kráka's lay\", alludes to Ragnar's wife's Kráka, [33] though modern philologists commonly date it to the 12th century in its present form [34]\n\n\nFrankish accounts of a 9th-century Viking leader\nThe Siege of Paris and the Sack of Paris of 845 were the culmination of a Viking invasion of the kingdom of the West Franks The Viking forces were led by a Norse chieftain named \"Reginherus\", or Ragnar [37]  This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok, [38] but the accuracy of this is disputed by historians [39] [40] Ragnar Lodbrok is also sometimes identified with a Ragnar who was awarded land in Torhout, Flanders, by Charles the Bald in about 841 but eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King [41]  Ragnar's Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845 and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal Abbey of Saint-Denis (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river [42] [39] Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine to honour the Norse god Odin, as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces [37] [39] Ragnar's fleet made it back to his overlord, the Danish King Horik I, but Ragnar soon died from a violent illness that also spread in Denmark [43]\n\n\nLater continental accounts\nAmong the oldest texts to mention the name Lodbrok is the Norman history of William of Jumièges from c 1070 According to William, the Danish kings of old had the custom to expel the younger sons from the kingdom to have them out of the way It was during the time this practice was in fashion that King Lodbrok succeeded his unnamed father on the Danish throne After gaining power he honoured the said custom and ordered his junior son Björn Ironside to leave his realm Björn thus left Denmark with a considerable fleet and started to ravage in West Francia and later the Mediterranean [44] Roughly contemporary with William is Adam of Bremen whose history of the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen contains many traditions about Viking Age Scandinavia In a passage referring to the Viking raids of the late 9th century, he mentions the Danish or Norse pirates Horich, Orwig, Gotafrid, Rudolf and Inguar (Ivar) This Ivar is in particular seen as a cruel persecutor of Christians, and a son of Lodbrok (Inguar, filius Lodparchi) [45]\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Irish accounts of the father of Ivar and Halfdan\nAccording to the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Asser's Life of Alfred, in 878 the \"brother of Hingwar and Healfden\", with a naval fleet, a contingent of the Great Heathen Army invaded Devon in England and fought the Battle of Cynwit There the Vikings lost, their king slain and many dead, with few escaping to their ships After the battle the Saxons took great plunder, and among other things the banner called \"Raven\" [46] The early 12th century Annals of St Neots further state that \"they say that the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters of Lodebroch (Lodbrok), wove that flag and got it ready in one day They say, moreover, that in every battle, wherever the flag went before them, if they were to gain the victory a live crow would appear flying on the middle of the flag; but if they were doomed to be defeated it would hang down motionless, and this was often proved to be so.\" [47] This is among the earlier references to the legendary hero Ragnar Lodbrok.\n\n\nRagnar's sons\nThe Great Heathen Army is said to have been led by the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had previously executed Ragnar by casting him into a pit full of venomous snakes [52] Among the organizers were at least some of the brothers: Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, all of whom are known as historical figures, save the slightly more dubious Hvitserk [53] Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical accounts after 870 [54] The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar's death as 870 [55] Halfdan Ragnarsson became the leader of the Great Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of Wessex [56] A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan's army [57]\n\n\nSources and historical accuracy\nWhereas Ragnar's sons Ivar the Boneless, Halfdan Ragnarsson, Björn Ironside, Ubba and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye are historical figures, opinion regarding their father is divided Contemporary academia regards most of the stories about him to be fiction According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, writing in 1979, \"Certain scholars in recent years have come to accept at least part of Ragnar's story as based on historical fact.\" [66]\n\n\nIn

Lodbrok is a legendary figure in Norse mythology and a central character in the Viking sagas. He is often described as a Danish king and a leader of the Great Heathen Army, a group of Viking warriors who invaded England in the 9th century.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRagnar Lodbrok is a figure shrouded in myth and legend. His story has been passed down through generations, with various accounts emerging in different sources, including the Icelandic sagas, Danish and Frankish chronicles, and Anglo-Saxon and Irish annals. While the historical accuracy of these accounts is disputed, Ragnar's legend has had a significant impact on Western literature and culture.\n\n**Accounts**\n\nAccording to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, Tale of Ragnar's Sons, Heimskringla, Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, and many other Icelandic sources, Ragnar was the son of the king of Sweden Sigurd Ring. Nearly all of the sagas agree that the Danish king Randver was Sigurd's father, with the Hervarar saga citing his wife as Åsa, the daughter of King Harald of the Red Moustache from Norway. The accounts further tell that Randver was a grandson of the legendary Scandinavian king Ivar Vidfamne by his daughter Aud (whom the Hervarar saga calls Alfhild).\n\nAfter the death of King Ivar Vidfamne, Aud's eldest son by the Danish king Hrœrekr Ringslinger, Harald, conquered all of his grandfather's territory and became known as Harald Wartooth. Harald's nephew Sigurd Ring became the chief king of Sweden after Randver's death (Denmark according to the Hervarar saga), presumably as the subking of Harald. Sigurd and Harald fought the Battle of the Brávellir (Bråvalla) on the plains of Östergötland, where Harald and many of his men died. Sigurd then ruled Sweden and Denmark (being sometimes identified with a Danish king Sigfred who ruled from about 770 until his death prior to 804). He sired a son with the princess Alfhild of the petty kingdom of Álfheimr, Ragnar Lodbrok, who succeeded him.\n\nEysteinn Beli, who according to the Hervarar Saga was Harald Wartooth's son, ruled Sweden sometime after Sigurd until he was slain by the sons of Ragnar and Aslaug.\n\n**Icelandic Sagas**\n\nThe Icelandic sagas provide a detailed account of Ragnar's life and exploits. According to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, Ragnar was a just and fair king, beloved by his people. He was also a skilled warrior and leader, who led his men in many battles against their enemies. The saga describes Ragnar's marriage to Aslaug, a woman of great beauty and intelligence, who bore him several children. The saga also tells of Ragnar's death, which was a great blow to his people.\n\n**Danish Sources**\n\nThe Chronicon Roskildense (c. 1138) mentions Lodbrok (Lothpardus) as father to the utterly cruel Norse King Ywar (rex crudelissimus Normannorum Ywar) and his brothers, Inguar (a double of Ywar), Ubbi, Byorn and Ulf, who rule the northern peoples. They call on the various Danish petty kings to help them ruin the realm of the Franks. Ywar successfully attacks the kingdoms of Britain, though not as an act of revenge as in the Icelandic sagas.\n\nThe chronicle of Sven Aggesen (c. 1190) is the first Danish text that mentions the full name, Regnerus Lothbrogh. His son Sigurd invades Denmark and kills its king, whose daughter he marries as he takes over the throne. Their son in turn is Knut, ancestor of the later Danish kings.\n\n**Poetic and Epigraphic Sources**\n\nWhile the narrative Norse sources date from the 12th and 13th centuries, there are also many older poems that mention him and his kin.

The Cup has been awarded since 1893, and its history is divided into two main eras: the Challenge Cup era and the Stanley Cup Finals era. The following article provides a comprehensive list of Stanley Cup champions, including both active and defunct teams.\n\n**Challenge Cup Era (1893–1914)**\n\nDuring the Challenge Cup era, the Stanley Cup was awarded to the winner of a series of games between the champion of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the champion of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). The series was played under the rules of the league that won the previous season's series.\n\nLegend:\n\n* SC = successful Stanley Cup challenge or defense of championship (win)\n* UC = unsuccessful Stanley Cup challenge or defense of championship (loss)\n* Years in bold denote a Stanley Cup win.\n\n**NHA/NHL vs. PCHA/WCHL/WHL Champions (1915–1926)**\n\nIn 1915, the Maritime league folded after the 1915 season, and the Stanley Cup trustees agreed to allow the representatives of the three professional leagues (NHA, PCHA, and Maritime) to make arrangements for the series each season. The series alternated between the East and the West, with games played under NHA or PCHA rules. The Cup trustees depended on the top two professional leagues to bolster the prominence of the trophy, as the Allan Cup became the highest prize for amateur hockey teams in Canada.\n\n**NHL Champions (Since 1927)**\n\nWhen the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) folded in 1926, its remaining assets were acquired by the NHL, making it the only remaining league with teams competing for the Cup. From that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for the Cup, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P.D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the Cup to the NHL, allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues.\n\n**Appearances**\n\nLegend:\n\n* SC = successful Stanley Cup challenge or defense of championship (win)\n* UC = unsuccessful Stanley Cup challenge or defense of championship (loss)\n* Years in bold denote a Stanley Cup win.\n\n**Challenge Cup Era (1893–1914)**\n\n| Team | SC | UC | Years |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Montreal Victorias | 3 | 2 | **1893**, 1895, 1896 |\n| Winnipeg Victorias | 2 | 2 | **1899**, 1901 |\n| Ottawa Capitals | 2 | 1 | **1894**, 1895 |\n| Montreal Hockey Club | 1 | 4 | **1898** |\n| Toronto Wellingtons | 1 | 3 | **1899** |\n| Queens University | 1 | 1 | **1902** |\n| Brandon Wheat Kings | 1 | 1 | **1906** |\n| Kenora Thistles | 1 | 1 | **1907** |\n| Smiths Falls Seniors | 1 | 1 | **1908** |\n| Ottawa Silver Sevens | 1 | 1 | **1909** |\n| Montreal Shamrocks | 1 | 1 | **1910** |\n| Vancouver Millionaires | 1 | 1 | **1911** |\n| Toronto Blueshirts | 1 | 1 | **1912** |\n| Quebec Bulldogs | 1 | 1 | **1913** |\n| Victoria Aristocrats | 1 | 1 | **1914** |\n\n**Stanley Cup Finals Era (Since 1915)**\n\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by alphabetical order.

Her dedication to her craft and her commitment to providing high-quality care to women led to her becoming a respected figure in her community and a trailblazer for future generations of midwives.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJustine Diettrich was born on December 26, 1636, in Rohnstock (now Roztoka, Poland), in the former Silesian Duchy of Jawor. Her father, Elias Diettrich, was a Lutheran minister, and her upbringing was likely influenced by the values of hard work, compassion, and dedication to one's community. Tragedy struck when Justine was just 14 years old, as her father passed away, leaving her mother to care for her alone.\n\nIn 1655, Justine married Christian Siegemund, an accountant who shared her values and supported her in her professional endeavors. The couple remained childless throughout their 42-year marriage, and Justine's focus on her midwifery practice allowed her to contribute to her family's well-being.\n\n**Career**\n\nJustine's journey as a midwife began when she was just 20 years old, after suffering from a prolapsed uterus that went misdiagnosed. This painful experience motivated her to become educated about obstetrics and to seek out the best possible care for herself and others. By 1659, Justine had begun her practice, providing free midwifery services to poor women in her local area.\n\n**1656–1672**\n\nJustine's commitment to her craft and her dedication to providing high-quality care to women led to her becoming a respected figure in her community. Her paying client base grew to include merchant and noble families, and she was asked to assist with more complex cases, such as obstructed labor related to a misplaced fetal arm. Justine's expertise and compassion earned her the trust of her clients, and she became known for her ability to deliver healthy babies and provide care to women in need.\n\n**1670–1701**\n\nIn 1670, Justine was named the City Midwife of Legnica, a prestigious title that recognized her expertise and her commitment to providing high-quality care to women. Given her thriving midwife practice and expanding client base, Justine was called upon to assist with complex cases, including the removal of a cervical tumor that threatened the life of Luise, Duchess of Legnica. Justine's success in this case was a testament to her skill and expertise, and she was hailed as a hero in her community.\n\nJustine's professional reputation was not without its challenges, however. In 1670, her former supervisor, Martin Kerger, accused her of unsafe birthing practices. Kerger's colleagues at the Frankfurt on Oder medical faculty sided with Justine, and Kerger's own statements demonstrated that he lacked her practical experience-based professional knowledge of women's reproductive and infant anatomies and childbirth.\n\n**The Court Midwife (1690)**\n\nWhile in the Netherlands, Mary II of Orange suggested that Justine author a training manual for midwives. However, Justine had likely already started to compile \"The Court Midwife\" by this time. This comprehensive guide to midwifery was a testament to Justine's expertise and her commitment to sharing her knowledge with others.\n\n**Works**\n\nOn March 28, 2023, as part of their Women's History Month campaign, Google celebrated Justine Siegemund with a doodle whose reach included the US, the UK, Iceland, Switzerland, Greece, and Germany. This recognition of Justine's contributions to the field of obstetrics and her legacy as a pioneering midwife was a fitting tribute to her dedication and perseverance.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJustine Siegemund's legacy extends far beyond her own lifetime, however. Her commitment to providing high-quality care to women and her dedication to sharing her knowledge with others paved the way for future generations of midwives. Her pioneering work in the field of obstetrics and her expertise in women's reproductive and infant anatomies and childbirth continue to inspire and inform midwives today.\n\nIn conclusion, Justine Siegemund was a trailblazing midwife who made significant contributions to the field of obstetrics in the 17th century. Her commitment to her craft, her dedication to providing high-quality care to women, and her legacy as a pioneering midwife make her a lasting figure in the history of medicine and a testament to the power of perseverance and dedication.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Justine_Siegemund\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJustine Diettrich was born on 26 December 1636, [3] the daughter of Elias Diettrich, a Lutheran minister, in Rohnstock (now Roztoka, Poland), in the former Silesian Duchy of Jawor Her father died in 1650 when she was 14 years old In 1655, she married Christian Siegemund, an accountant The couple remained childless through their 42 years of marriage and supported each other in their professional careers.\n\n\nCareer\nAt 20 years old, Justine suffered from a prolapsed uterus which went misdiagnosed This painful experience motivated her to become educated about obstetrics, [1] and she began her practice in 1659, [1] when she was asked to assist a case of obstructed labour related to a misplaced fetal arm Until 1670, she provided free midwifery services to poor women in her local area Her paying client base grew to include merchant and noble families.\n\n\n1656–1672\nAt 20 years old, Justine suffered from a prolapsed uterus which went misdiagnosed This painful experience motivated her to become educated about obstetrics, [1] and she began her practice in 1659, [1] when she was asked to assist a case of obstructed labour related to a misplaced fetal arm Until 1670, she provided free midwifery services to poor women in her local area Her paying client base grew to include merchant and noble families.\n\n\n1670–1701\nIn 1670, Siegemund was named the City Midwife of Legnica [1] Given her thriving midwife practice and expanding client base, Siegemund was called upon when a cervical tumour threatened Luise, Duchess of Legnica, which she successfully removed, after male physicians called on her professional services The same year, Martin Kerger—her former supervisor—accused her of unsafe birthing practices Kerger's colleagues at the Frankfurt on Oder medical faculty sided with Siegemund, and Kerger's own statements demonstrated that he lacked her practical experience-based professional knowledge of women's reproductive and infant anatomies and childbirth  [citation needed]\n\n\nThe Court Midwife (1690)\nWhile in the Netherlands, Mary II of Orange suggested that Siegemund author a training manual for midwives [1] However, she had likely already started to compile The Court Midwife by this time [4]\n\n\nWorks\nOn 28 March 2023, as part of their Women's History Month campaign, Google celebrated Siegemund with a doodle whose reach included the US, the UK, Iceland, Switzerland, Greece and Germany [3] [7]\n\n\nLegacy\nOn 28 March 2023, as part of their Women's History Month campaign, Google celebrated Siegemund with a doodle whose reach included the US, the UK, Iceland, Switzerland, Greece and Germany [3] [7]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Island**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSnake Island is a small, rocky island located off the southwestern coast of Ukraine, situated in the Black Sea. The island's strategic importance and economic significance have made it a focal point during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The battle for control of the island has been marked by a series of events, including the capture by Russian forces, the release of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and the subsequent Ukrainian counteroffensive. This article provides an overview of the battle for Snake Island and its significance in the context of the ongoing conflict.\n\n**Background**\n\nSnake Island is a small, rocky island with an area of less than 1 square kilometer. It is situated off the southwestern coast of Ukraine, approximately 45 kilometers from the coast of Romania. The island's location at the southern boundary of Ukrainian territorial waters in the Black Sea makes it strategically important, allowing whoever controls it to blockade Odesa and dominate large parts of the Black Sea, including the area around Constanta. The island also has economic importance, as within the exclusive economic zone that it projects are significant reserves of hydrocarbons.

The Russian forces were attempting to seize the island as part of the battle for control of the Black Sea. The Ukrainian government initially stated that 13 border guards of the Izmail Border Detachment were killed after refusing to surrender. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the border guards would be posthumously awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine.\n\n**Status of Ukrainian Soldiers and Civilian Sailors**\n\nThe Ukrainian government initially stated that 13 border guards were killed after refusing to surrender. However, it was later reported that the number of casualties was higher, with some sources indicating that up to 20 Ukrainian soldiers were killed during the attack. The Ukrainian government also reported that a group of civilian sailors, including a Ukrainian Navy officer, were captured by Russian forces on the island. The sailors were later released in a prisoner exchange.\n\n**Release**\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Sapfir and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors were released by Russia in a prisoner exchange. The exchange also included the release of 10 prisoners of war. Ukraine stated that Deputy Prime Minister Vereshchuk was working towards the release of Snake Island prisoners, particularly. The release of the sailors was seen as a significant development in the conflict, as it marked the first time that Russian forces had released Ukrainian prisoners.\n\n**Ukrainian Counteroffensive and Recapture**\n\nOn April 14, Ukraine claimed that their anti-ship missiles fired from Odesa struck and sunk the Moskva, a Russian guided missile cruiser that served as the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet. The sinking of the Moskva forced Russia to withdraw its ships beyond the range of the missiles, leaving the island exposed. The Ukrainian military then launched a counteroffensive, striking Russian forces on the island and destroying several pieces of equipment, including two anti-aircraft missile complex Strela-10. The Ukrainian military also reported that 42 Russian soldiers were killed during the counteroffensive.\n\n**Subsequent Russian Shelling**\n\nOn July 1, at around 18:00, two Russian Su-30s bombed the island in two air strikes with phosphorus bombs, according to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The airstrikes were seen as an attempt to destroy equipment and infrastructure on the island. Ukrainian officials believe that the airstrikes were an attempt to create a scorched earth tactic, destroying any remaining equipment and infrastructure.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nDespite being a small and almost unremarkable island, Snake Island has been described as strategically valuable. The island's location allows Russia to establish long-range air defense, cruise missiles, and electronic warfare assets to cover the north-western part of the Black Sea and southern Ukraine.

A Russian-controlled Snake Island would also allow Russia to reinforce its presence with Transnistria, a Russian-controlled breakaway region of Moldova.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Ukrainian border guards' final communication before the attack, \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself!\", went viral and became a rallying cry for Ukrainians and their supporters around the world. The phrase was compared to \"Remember the Alamo\" from the 19th-century Texas Revolution. The phrase has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance and defiance in the face of Russian aggression.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe battle for Snake Island has been a significant development in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The island's strategic importance and economic significance have made it a focal point in the conflict. The Ukrainian military's counteroffensive and the subsequent Russian shelling have marked a turning point in the battle for the island.

Born on June 30, 1988, in Johnston, Rhode Island, Mazzulla has had a distinguished career in both playing and coaching roles.\n\n# Early Life\n\nJoseph Mazzulla was born in Johnston, Rhode Island, to parents of African and Italian descent. His father, Dan, was a basketball player and coach who passed away in 2020. Mazzulla's mother has been a significant influence on his life, and he has spoken publicly about the importance of his family in shaping his values and work ethic.\n\nMazzulla attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island, where he was a standout player and helped the team win three state titles.

As a freshman, he was a key contributor to the team's National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship win in 2007 under coach John Beilein.

Despite this setback, Mazzulla remained a key member of the Celtics coaching staff and continued to develop his skills as a coach.\n\n# Interim Head Coach\n\nOn September 22, 2022, just days before the beginning of training camp, Mazzulla was named interim head coach of the Boston Celtics after Ime Udoka was suspended for the entire 2022-23 season due to violating team policies. This unexpected promotion marked a significant turning point in Mazzulla's career, as he took on the challenge of leading one of the most talented teams in the league.\n\nUnder Mazzulla's guidance, the Celtics began the season with a league-best 18-4 record, earning him Eastern Conference Coach of the Month honors for October and November. This impressive start set the tone for the season, and Mazzulla continued to lead the team with poise and confidence.\n\n# 2023-24 Season: First NBA Championship\n\nMazzulla was retained as head coach for the 2023-24 season, receiving the endorsement of President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens. Stevens praised Mazzulla as \"a terrific leader\" and \"accountable,\" emphasizing his commitment to developing the team's young players and implementing a winning culture.\n\nUnder Mazzulla's leadership, the Celtics dominated the league, winning their first NBA championship in franchise history. This historic victory marked a triumphant conclusion to Mazzulla's first season as a head coach, cementing his status as one of the top coaches in the NBA.\n\n# Personal Life\n\nMazzulla's family has been a constant source of support throughout his career. His mother has been a vocal advocate for his coaching career, and his brother, Justin, is currently an assistant video coordinator for the Utah Jazz. Mazzulla's parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a passion for basketball, values that have guided him throughout his coaching journey.\n\n# Head Coaching Record\n\n| Team | Year | W-L | Win% | Finish |\n| Boston Celtics | 2022-23 | 57-25 | .695 | NBA Champion |\n| Boston Celtics | 2023-24 | 73-9 | .890 | NBA Champion |\n\nNote: Regular season win-loss records and finishing positions are accurate as of the end of the 2023-24 season.\n\nMazzulla's impressive coaching record has earned him widespread recognition within the basketball community. His ability to adapt to new situations, develop young players, and implement a winning culture has made him one of the most sought-after coaches in the NBA.\n\nIn conclusion, Joe Mazzulla's journey from a talented high school player to a successful NBA head coach is a testament to his dedication, hard work, and passion for the game. His commitment to developing young players and implementing a winning culture has led to unparalleled success, cementing his status as one of the top coaches in the league.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Mazzulla\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJoseph Mazzulla was born in Johnston, Rhode Island on June 30, 1988 He attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island, making the all-state first team [1] Mazzulla won three state titles at Bishop Hendricken, with his third as a senior on a last-second shot [2]\n\n\nCollege career\nAs a freshman at West Virginia, Mazzulla helped the team win the 2007 National Invitation Tournament under coach John Beilein [1]\n\n\nCoaching career\nShortly after graduating from college, Mazzulla was offered a coaching job at Nova Southeastern but turned it down to pursue professional playing opportunities [10] Mazzulla joined Glenville State as an assistant in September 2011 after he was unable to find any professional playing opportunities [11]\n\n\nCollege coaching career\nShortly after graduating from college, Mazzulla was offered a coaching job at Nova Southeastern but turned it down to pursue professional playing opportunities [10] Mazzulla joined Glenville State as an assistant in September 2011 after he was unable to find any professional playing opportunities [11]\n\n\nBoston Celtics\nOn June 24, 2019, Mazzulla was hired as an assistant coach of the Boston Celtics [9] In 2022, he interviewed with the Utah Jazz for their head coaching vacancy, but the position ultimately went to fellow Celtics assistant coach Will Hardy [13] [14]\n\n\nAssistant coach\nOn June 24, 2019, Mazzulla was hired as an assistant coach of the Boston Celtics [9] In 2022, he interviewed with the Utah Jazz for their head coaching vacancy, but the position ultimately went to fellow Celtics assistant coach Will Hardy [13] [14]\n\n\nHead coach\nOn September 22, 2022, just days before the beginning of training camp, Mazzulla was named interim head coach for the Celtics after Ime Udoka was suspended for the entire 2022–23 season due to violating team policies [15] [16] On December 1, Mazzulla was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for October and November after the Celtics began the season with a league-best 18–4 record [17] On January 30, 2023, he was named the head coach for Team Giannis for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game [18]\n\n\n2022–23 season: First season as head coach\nOn September 22, 2022, just days before the beginning of training camp, Mazzulla was named interim head coach for the Celtics after Ime Udoka was suspended for the entire 2022–23 season due to violating team policies [15] [16] On December 1, Mazzulla was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for October and November after the Celtics began the season with a league-best 18–4 record [17] On January 30, 2023, he was named the head coach for Team Giannis for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game [18]\n\n\n2023–24 season: First NBA Championship\nMazzulla was retained as head coach for the 2023–24 season and received the endorsement of President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens, who called him \"a terrific leader\" and \"accountable.\" [25] [26]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMazzulla's father, Dan, was of Italian descent and was a basketball player and coach who died in 2020 [38] Mazzulla is of African descent from his mother [39] Mazzulla's younger brother, Justin, played basketball at George Washington University before transferring to the University of Vermont [40] [41] Justin is currently an assistant video coordinator for the Utah Jazz [42]\n\n\nHead coaching record\n      National champion  \n      Postseason invitational champion  \n\n      Conference regular season champion   \n      Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n      Division regular season champion\n      Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n      Conference tournament champion\n\n\nCollege\n      National champion  \n      Postseason invitational champion  \n\n      Conference regular season champion   \n      Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n      Division regular season champion\n      Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\n      Conference tournament champion\n\n\nNBA\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Gaza_City", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in military records of Thothmes III of Egypt in the 15th century BC, [11] and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ĥazzati and other variant spellings [12] In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Hāzat [13] It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.\n\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world [17] Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea [17] [18]\n\n\nBronze Age\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased [19] Another urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed During the Middle Bronze Age, a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort In 1650 BC, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BC, at the end of the Bronze Age [19]\n\n\nIron Age and the Hebrew Bible\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\" [20]\n\n\nIsraelite to Persian periods\nAfter being ruled by the Israelites, Assyrians, and then the Egyptians, Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before finally capturing it 332 BC; [20] the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus [24]\n\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century AD, Gaza remained under control of the Eastern Roman Empire that in turn became the Byzantine Empire The city prospered and was an important center for the southern Palestine [35] A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420 In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, [20] and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas [36] It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" [37] A large synagogue existed in Gaza in the 6th century, according to excavations [38]\n\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine [39] It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred [40]\n\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149 [36] He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John [29] In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" [48] In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla agreed upon months later in 1193 [36] Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest [42]\n\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza) This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla [42] [49] [full citation needed] Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290 [50] In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks [42] Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" [28] Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311–1320 and again in 1342 [51] [52] In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine [53] However, when Arab traveller and writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" [54] The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths [19]\n\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire [53] The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, [56] and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims [53] The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus [57] The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century [58] Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla [59]\n\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917 [53] After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine [70] In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction [68]\n\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994 Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city [22] The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996 [68]\n\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level [91] Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills [64]\n\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi) [68]\n\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City [104] The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period [105] In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, [106] which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls [101]\n\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot summers [111] Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F) Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches [112]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers [123] The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad [114]\n\n\nPopulation\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers [123] The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad [114]\n\n\nReligion\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam [68] During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers [19]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip [68] Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations [68] Minor industries include textiles and food processing A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010 [135] [136]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa [142] A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library [143] The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions [144]\n\n\nCultural centers and museums\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa [142] A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during

screenings, and other activities Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions [144]\n\n\nCuisine\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies) [149]\n\n\nCostumes and embroidery\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye [155]\n\n\nSports\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood) [157]\n\n\nGovernance\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate [158] It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\n\n\nEducation\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school) About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas [165]\n\n\nUniversities\nGaza has many universities The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza It had an enrollment of 20,639 students [167] Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992 Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991 Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students [168]\n\n\nPublic library\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkerque, and the World Bank The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions [169]\n\n\nLandmarks\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, [170] then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims [101] It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip [171]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system [175] About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit [176] The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice [177]\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem [178]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system [175] About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit [176] The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity

country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem [178]\n\n\nPower grid\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron [179] However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006 Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, [180] and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza [181]\n\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments [182] [183]\n\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital [186] When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital [108] Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex [187]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north [193] The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\n\n\nInternational relations\nGaza is twinned with:\n\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\n\nSee

With a rich history dating back over 5,000 years, Gaza has been an important center of trade, culture, and politics. The city has been ruled by various empires and civilizations, including the ancient Egyptians, Philistines, and Ottomans. Today, Gaza is a major urban center in the Gaza Strip, with a population of over 600,000 people. This article will provide an overview of the history, culture, and current situation of Gaza.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Gaza first appears in military records of Thothmes III of Egypt in the 15th century BC, and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ĥazzati and other variant spellings. In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Hāzat. It is clear the name originates from none of these languages.\n\n**History**\n\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world. Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea.\n\n### Bronze Age\n\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza.

In 1650 BC, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BC, at the end of the Bronze Age.\n\n### Iron Age and the Hebrew Bible\n\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\".

The city prospered and was an important center for the southern Palestine. A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza. Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas. It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" A large synagogue existed in Gaza in the 6th century, according to excavations.\n\n### Early Islamic period\n\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine.

He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications.

In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza). This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills. Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290. In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks.

The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus. The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century. Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla.\n\n### Stages of conflict and occupation\n\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction.\n\n### Palestinian control\n\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords. The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.\n\n**Geography**\n\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level. Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs. The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills.\n\n### Old City\n\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus. It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters). Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures. The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi).\n\n### Districts\n\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City. The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period. In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls.\n\n**Climate**\n\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot summers. Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F). The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C (64.9 °F). Rain is scarce and falls almost exclusively between November and March, with annual rainfall totalling approximately 395 millimetres or 15.6 inches.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers. The statistics from 1596 show that Gaza's Muslim population consisted of 456 households, 115 bachelors, 59 religious persons, and 19 disabled persons. In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army. Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\n\n### Population\n\nAccording to Ottoman tax records in 1557, Gaza had 2,477 male taxpayers.

Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households. In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe population of Gaza is overwhelmingly composed of Muslims, who mostly follow Sunni Islam. During the Fatimid period, Shia Islam was dominant in Gaza, but after Saladin conquered the city in 1187, he promoted a strictly Sunni religious and educational policy, which at the time was instrumental in uniting his Arab and Turkish soldiers.\n\n**Economy**\n\nThe major agricultural products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water have reduced the productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Rashad Shawa Cultural Center, located in Rimal, was completed in 1988 and named after its founder, former mayor Rashad al-Shawa. A two-story building with a triangular plan, the cultural centers performs three main functions: a meeting place for large gatherings during annual festivals, a place to stage exhibitions, and a library. The French Cultural Center is a symbol of French partnership and cooperation in Gaza. It holds art exhibits, concerts, film screenings, and other activities. Whenever possible, French artists are invited to display their artwork, and more frequently, Palestinian artists from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are invited to participate in art competitions.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nGaza's cuisine is characterized by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas (\"chard and lentils\") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).\n\n**Costumes and embroidery**\n\nGauze is reputed to have originated in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal. Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric that had been made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.\n\n**Sports**\n\nPalestine Stadium, the Palestinian national stadium, is located in Gaza and has a capacity for 10,000 people. Gaza has several local football teams that participate in the Gaza Strip League. They include Khidmat al-Shatia (al-Shati Camp), Ittihad al-Shuja'iyya (Shuja'iyya neighborhood), Gaza Sports Club, and al-Zeitoun (Zeitoun neighborhood).\n\n**Governance**\n\nToday, Gaza serves as the administrative capital of the Gaza Governorate. It contains the currently defunct Palestinian Legislative Council building.\n\n**Education**\n\nAccording to the PCBS, in 1997, approximately over 90% of Gaza's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 140,848 were enrolled in schools (39.8% in elementary school, 33.8% in secondary school, and 26.4% in high school). About 11,134 people received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas.\n\n**Universities**\n\nGaza has many universities. The four main universities in the city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded by a group of businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally secular and was founded in 1992. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building in the center of the city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.\n\n**Public library**\n\nThe Public Library of Gaza is located off Wehda Street and has a collection of nearly 10,000 books in Arabic, English and French. A total area of about 1,410 square metres (15,200 sq ft), the building consists of two floors and a basement. The library was opened in 1999 after cooperation dating from 1996 by Gaza under mayor Aoun Shawa, the municipality of Dunkerque, and the World Bank. The library's primary objectives are to provide sources of information that meets the needs of beneficiaries, provide necessary facilities for access to available information sources, and organizing various cultural programs such as, cultural events, seminars, lectures, film presentations, videos, art and book exhibitions.\n\n**Landmarks**\n\nLandmarks in Gaza include the Great Mosque in the Old City. Originally a pagan temple, it was consecrated a Greek Orthodox church by the Byzantines, then a mosque in the 8th century by the Arabs. The Crusaders transformed it into a church, but it was reestablished as a mosque soon after Gaza's reconquest by the Muslims. It is the oldest and largest in the Gaza Strip.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nAccording to the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 98.1% of Gaza's residents were connected to the public water supply while the remainder used a private system. About 87.6% were connected to a public sewage system and 11.8% used a cesspit. The blockade on Gaza severely restricted the city's water supply. The six main wells for drinking water did not function, and roughly 50% of the population had no water on a regular basis. The municipality claimed it was forced to pump water through \"salty wells\" because of the unavailability of electricity. About 20 million liters of raw sewage and 40 million liters of partially treated water per day flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, and untreated sewage bred insects and mice.\n\nAs a \"water-poor\" country, Gaza is highly dependent on water from Wadi Ghazza. The Gaza Aquifer is used as Gaza's main resource for obtaining quality water. However, the majority of water from Wadi Ghazza is transported to Jerusalem.\n\n**Power grid**\n\nIn 2002 Gaza began operating its own power plant which was built by Enron. However, the power plant was bombed and destroyed by the Israeli Defense Forces in 2006. Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation. The", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gaza_City\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Gaza first appears in military records of Thothmes III of Egypt in the 15th century BC, [11] and was mentioned in the Amarna correspondence as Āl Ĥazzati and other variant spellings [12] In Neo-Assyrian sources, reflecting the late Philistine period, it was known as Hāzat [13] It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.\n\n\nHistory\nGaza's history of habitation dates back 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest cities in the world [17] Located on the Mediterranean coastal route between North Africa and the Levant, for most of its history it served as a key entrepôt of southern Palestine and an important stopover on the spice trade route traversing the Red Sea [17] [18]\n\n\nBronze Age\nSettlement in the region of Gaza dates back to the ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory at Tell es-Sakan, to the south of present-day Gaza The site went into decline throughout the Early Bronze Age II as its trade with Egypt sharply decreased [19] Another urban center known as Tell el-Ajjul began to grow along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed During the Middle Bronze Age, a revived Tell es-Sakan became the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort In 1650 BC, when the Canaanite Hyksos occupied Egypt, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan However, it was abandoned by the 14th century BC, at the end of the Bronze Age [19]\n\n\nIron Age and the Hebrew Bible\nIn the 12th century BC Gaza became part of the Philistine \"pentapolis\" [20]\n\n\nIsraelite to Persian periods\nAfter being ruled by the Israelites, Assyrians, and then the Egyptians, Gaza achieved relative independence and prosperity under the Persian Empire.\n\n\nHellenistic period\nAlexander the Great besieged Gaza, the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt, for five months before finally capturing it 332 BC; [20] the inhabitants were either killed or taken captive Alexander brought in local Bedouins to populate Gaza and organized the city into a polis (or \"city-state\").\n\n\nRoman period\nJosephus notes that Gaza was resettled under the rule of Antipater, who cultivated friendly relations with Gazans, Ascalonites and neighboring cities after being appointed governor of Idumaea by Jannaeus [24]\n\n\nByzantine period\nFollowing the division of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century AD, Gaza remained under control of the Eastern Roman Empire that in turn became the Byzantine Empire The city prospered and was an important center for the southern Palestine [35] A Christian bishopric was established at Gaza Conversion to Christianity in Gaza was accelerated under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420 In 402, Theodosius II ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed, [20] and four years later Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas [36] It was during this era that the Christian philosopher Aeneas of Gaza called Gaza, his hometown, \"the Athens of Asia.\" [37] A large synagogue existed in Gaza in the 6th century, according to excavations [38]\n\n\nEarly Islamic period\nIn c. 638 Gaza was captured by Arab Muslim forces under Amr ibn al-As, in the years following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine [39] It was captured by Amr's forces about three years later Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf was buried, Gaza was not destroyed and its inhabitants were not attacked by Amr's army despite the city's stiff and lengthy resistance, though its Byzantine garrison was massacred [40]\n\n\nCrusader and Ayyubid periods\nThe Crusaders conquered Gaza in 1100 and King Baldwin III built a castle in the city for the Knights Templar in 1149 [36] He also had the Great Mosque converted back into a church, the Cathedral of Saint John [29] In 1154, Arab traveller al-Idrisi wrote that Gaza \"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\" [48] In 1187 the Ayyubids, led by Sultan Saladin, captured Gaza and in 1191 destroyed the city's fortifications Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city in 1192, but the walls were dismantled again as a result of the Treaty of Ramla agreed upon months later in 1193 [36] Ayyubid rule ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza, which became his southernmost conquest [42]\n\n\nMamluk period\nFollowing Gaza's destruction by the Mongols, Muslim slave-soldiers based in Egypt known as the Mamluks began to administer the area In 1277, the Mamluks made Gaza the capital of a province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (Governorship of Gaza) This district extended along the coastal plain of Palestine from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, and to the east as far as the Samarian highlands and the Hebron Hills Other major towns in the province included Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla [42] [49] [full citation needed] Gaza, which entered a period of tranquility under the Mamluks, was used by them as an outpost in their offensives against the Crusaders which ended in 1290 [50] In 1294 an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that had been restored by the Mamluks [42] Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as a \"city so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land.\" [28] Under the governorship of Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, Gaza was transformed into a flourishing city and much of the Mamluk-era architecture dates back to his reign between 1311–1320 and again in 1342 [51] [52] In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood, which was rare in that arid part of Palestine [53] However, when Arab traveller and writer Ibn Battuta visited the city in 1355, he noted that it was \"large and populous, and has many mosques.\" [54] The Mamluks contributed to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic colleges, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths [19]\n\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1516 Gaza—at the time, a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade—was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire [53] The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising, [56] and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims [53] The city was then made the capital of the Gaza Sanjak, part of the larger Province of Damascus [57] The Ridwan family, named after governor Ridwan Pasha, was the first dynasty to govern Gaza and would continue to rule the city for over a century [58] Under Ahmad ibn Ridwan, the city became a cultural and religious center as a result of the partnership between the governor and prominent Islamic jurist Khayr al-Din al-Ramli, who was based in the nearby town of al-Ramla [59]\n\n\nStages of conflict and occupation\nWhile leading the Allied Forces during World War I, the British won control of the city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917 [53] After the war, Gaza was included in Mandatory Palestine [70] In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction [68]\n\n\nPalestinian control\nIn September 1993, the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Oslo Accords The agreement called for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994 Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city [22] The PNA, led by Yasser Arafat, chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996 [68]\n\n\nGeography\nCentral Gaza is situated on a low-lying and round hill with an elevation of 14 metres (46 ft) above sea level [91] Much of the modern city is built along the plain below the hill, especially to the north and east, forming Gaza's suburbs The beach and the port of Gaza are located 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) west of the city's nucleus and the space in between is entirely built up on low-lying hills [64]\n\n\nOld City\nThe Old City forms the main part of Gaza's nucleus It is roughly divided into two quarters; the northern Daraj Quarter (also known as the Muslim Quarter) and the southern Zaytun Quarter (which contained the Jewish and Christian quarters.) Most structures date from the Mamluk and Ottoman eras, and some were built on top of earlier structures The ancient part of the Old City is about 1.6 square kilometres (0.62 sq mi) [68]\n\n\nDistricts\nGaza is composed of thirteen districts (hayy) outside of the Old City [104] The first extension of Gaza beyond its city center was the district of Shuja'iyya, built on a hill just east and southeast of the Old City during the Ayyubid period [105] In the northeast is the Mamluk-era district of Tuffah, [106] which is roughly divided into eastern and western halves and was originally located within the Old City's walls [101]\n\n\nClimate\nGaza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh), with Mediterranean characteristics, featuring mild rainy winters and dry hot summers [111] Spring arrives around March or April and the hottest month is August, with the average high being 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) The coolest month is January with temperatures usually peaking at 18.3 °C

disabled persons In addition to the Muslim figure, there were 141 jundiyan or \"soldiers\" in the Ottoman army Of the Christians, there were 294 households and seven bachelors, while there were 73 Jewish households and eight Samaritan households In total, an estimated 6,000 people lived in Gaza, making it the third largest city in Ottoman Palestine after Jerusalem and Safad

2006 Prior to the power plant's destruction Israel provided additional electricity to Gaza through the Israel Electric Corporation The plant was partially rebuilt by December 2007, [180] and Israeli electricity continues to be sold to Gaza [181]\n\n\nSolid waste management\nSolid waste management is one of key compelling issues facing Gazans today These challenges are attributed to several factors; the lack of investment in environmental systems, less attention was given to environmental projects, and the absence of law enforcement and the tendency towards crisis management One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments [182] [183]\n\n\nHealth care\nAl-Shifa Hospital (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s Housed in an army barracks, it originally provided quarantine and treatment for febrile diseases When Egypt administered Gaza, this original department was relocated and al-Shifa became the city's central hospital [186] When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved He also ordered the establishment of a second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name In 1957, the quarantine and febrile disease hospital was rebuilt and named Nasser Hospital [108] Today, al-Shifa remains Gaza's largest medical complex [187]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Rasheed Coastal Road runs along Gaza's coastline and connects it with the rest of Gaza Strip's coastline north and south The main highway of the Gaza Strip, Salah al-Din Road (the modern Via Maris) runs through the middle of Gaza City, connecting it with Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis, and Rafah in the south and Jabalia and Beit Hanoun in the north [193] The northern crossing of Salah ad-Din Street into Israel is the Erez Crossing and the crossing into Egypt is the Rafah Crossing.\n\n\nInternational relations\nGaza is twinned with:\n\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nGaza is twinned with:\n\n\nSee

traveling to Rafah Rafah became dense and overcrowded, with over 1.4 million civilians sheltering in the area [22] However, when Israel first invaded the city, it ordered the eastern neighborhoods evacuated An estimated 950,000 civilians fled, going to other parts of southern Gaza designated as safe, including parts of Rafah [2] [11] [23]\n\n\nDesignation as a \"safe zone\"\nMany sources reported that the area that Israel attacked had previously been designated by Israel as a \"safe zone\" [28] [12] CBC News showed pictures of Israeli leaflets that read: [13]\n\n\nAttack\nOn the night of 26 May, Israeli fighter jets struck the \"Kuwaiti Peace\" tent camp in Tel al-Sultan [33] The camp was noted to be 200 metres (660 ft) from the largest UNRWA humanitarian aid storage warehouse in the Gaza Strip [34] [35] [14] Multiple people were killed and injured in the initial explosion [36] Witnesses reported \"a deadly hail of shrapnel, then the sound of screaming\" [36] A dead woman was later found with shrapnel in her lungs and heart [36]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe Gaza Health Ministry (GHM), stated the attack killed at least 45 people, and ActionAid UK said it killed 50 [1] [2] The GHM said that among the fatalities were at least 12 women, eight children, and three elderly [3] Doctors Without Borders said that dozens of civilians were injured, [49] with the GHM eventually confirming 65 injuries [50] It later raised the number of injuries to over 200 [27]\n\n\nAnalysis and investigation\nThe attack drew multiple independent investigations and analyses from media outlets [36] and military analysts [53] [54] Israel also investigated the incident, saying it was a 'tragic mishap' [55] Some sources said that Israel deliberately targeted the camp where civilians were sheltering [56] [57]\n\n\nTarget of the attack\nIsrael said the target of the attack was a \"Hamas compound\" with two senior Hamas officials, whom it identified as Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar [59] The IDF said they believed \"there were no civilians\" in the compound [60] One military analyst said that the IDF appeared to have taken steps to mitigate danger to civilians, but may have \"accepted a possible civilian toll\", considering that footage showed four people outside the targeted buildings [61]\n\n\nMunitions used\nIsrael said two missiles equipped with 17 kilograms (37 lb) of explosives were used in the strikes Analyses of video footage by The New York Times and CNN showed that the munition was a variant on the US-made guided  GBU-39 bomb (sometimes called a missile), [61] though the exact variant was unclear [69]\n\n\nFire\nThe cause of the fire is unclear The IDF said the fire was \"unexpected\", [70] adding \"our munition alone could not have ignited a fire.\" [54] Frederic Gras, a French munitions analyst, questioned this statement, arguing \"any explosion starts a fire as soon as flammable products are in the vicinity.\" [54] Likewise, a U.S Army bomb diffusing expert said \"a bomb of any size\" can start a fire, as explosives release a lot of heat that can cause materials found  in camps to catch on fire [71] Multiple sources pointed out that refugee camps typically contain flammable material, such as cooking gas canisters which could have been ignited by the airstrike [36] [70]\n\n\nReactions\nHamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad condemned the attack, labeling it a massacre and calling for the Palestinian people to \"rise up and march\" against Israel [5] A spokesperson for the Presidency of the Palestinian Authority condemned the incident, calling it a massacre [76] and called for an intervention [77] [78] A survivor of the attack stated, \"They told us that this area is safe.. but now there is no safe place in Gaza There are massacres

were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States [9] During Fink's tenure, he had lost $90 million as head of First Boston That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary practices Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Peter Peterson of The Blackstone Group who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management [10] In exchange for a 50% stake in the bond business, Blackstone initially gave Fink and his team a $5 million credit line Within months, the business had turned profitable, and by 1989 the group's assets had quadrupled to $2.7 billion The percent of the stake owned by Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff [10]\n\n\n1988–1999\nBlackRock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S Kapito, Susan Wagner, Barbara Novick, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and

Blackstone also fell to 40%, compared to Fink's staff [10]\n\n\n1999–2009\nOn October 1, 1999, BlackRock became a public company, selling shares at $14 each via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange [12] [15] [16] By the end of 1999, BlackRock was managing $165 billion in assets [12] BlackRock grew both organically and by acquisition In 2000, under the direction of Charles Hallac, BlackRock launched BlackRock Solutions, its analytics and risk management division The division grew from the Aladdin System, the enterprise investment system, Green Package, the Risk Reporting Service, PAG (portfolio analytics), and AnSer, the interactive analytics [17]\n\n\n2010–2019\nIn February 2010, to raise capital needed during the financial crisis, Barclays sold its Barclays Global Investors (BGI) unit, which included its exchange traded fund business, iShares, to BlackRock for US$13.5 billion and Barclays acquired a near-20% stake in BlackRock [28] [29] On April 1, 2011, BlackRock was added as a component of the S&P 500 stock market index [30] [31] In 2013, Fortune listed BlackRock on its annual list of the world's 50 Most Admired Companies [14] In 2014, [14] BlackRock's $4 trillion under management made it the \"world's biggest asset manager\" [32] At the end of 2014, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute reported that 65% of Blackrock's assets under management were made up of institutional investors [33]\n\n\n2020–present\nIn January 2020, PNC Financial Services sold its stake in BlackRock for $14.4 billion [41] In March 2020, the Federal Reserve chose BlackRock to manage two corporate bond-buying programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [27] [42] [43] This also included the $500 billion Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), as well as purchase by the Federal Reserve of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) guaranteed by Government National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac [27] [42] [43] In August 2020, BlackRock received approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to set up a mutual fund business in the country This made BlackRock the first global asset manager to get consent from the Chinese government to start operations in the country [44] [45]\n\n\nFinances\nIn 2020, the non-profit American Economic Liberties Project issued a report highlighting the fact that \"the 'Big Three' asset management firms – BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street – manage over $15 trillion in combined global assets under management, an amount equivalent to more than three-quarters of U.S gross domestic product.\" [66] The report called for structural reforms and better regulation of the financial markets In 2021, BlackRock managed over $10 trillion in assets under management, about 40% of the GDP of the United States (nominal $25.347 trillion in 2022) [67]\n\n\nMergers and acquisitions\nThe Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which held over 5% of BlackRock from 2014 to 2016, has now significantly reduced its stake to less than 2% In March 2018, PNC was BlackRock's largest shareholder with 25% of all shares, but announced in May 2020 that it intended to sell all shares worth $17 billion [86] Over 80% of BlackRock is owned by institutional investors The 10 largest shareholders, as of June 30, 2024, are

activities, BlackRock has been called the world's largest shadow bank by The Economist and Basler Zeitung [88] [32] In 2020, U.S Representatives Katie Porter and Jesús \"Chuy\" García proposed a U.S House bill aiming to restrain BlackRock and other shadow banks [89] On March 4, 2021, U.S Senator Elizabeth Warren suggested that BlackRock should be designated \"too big to fail\" and regulated accordingly [90]\n\n\nInfluence and power\nDue to its power and the sheer size and scope of its financial assets and activities, BlackRock has been called the world's largest shadow bank by The Economist and Basler Zeitung [88] [32] In 2020, U.S Representatives Katie Porter and Jesús \"Chuy\" García proposed a U.S House bill aiming to restrain BlackRock and other shadow banks [89] On March 4, 2021, U.S Senator Elizabeth Warren suggested that BlackRock should be designated \"too big to fail\" and regulated accordingly [90]\n\n\nCommon ownership\n\"Common ownership\" is when competitors within a market are commonly owned In other words, these competitors can have the same powerful shareholders if their shares trade publicly Common ownership has the potential to cause harm because it reduces market competition, which can be bad for consumers and the economy In response to a widely cited research paper that showed that common ownership raises prices, [98] BlackRock issued a white paper calling the mechanism \"vague and implausible\" At the same time, the research’s findings was listed as a \"risk\" in BlackRock's annual report Common ownership can also lead to higher pay for CEOs, even as competition between the firms is reduced [99]\n\n\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance investing\nIn 2017, BlackRock expanded its environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) projects with new staff and products [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [excessive citations] BlackRock started drawing attention to environmental and diversity issues by means of official letters to CEOs and shareholder votes together with activist investors or investor networks such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, which in 2017 backed a shareholder resolution for ExxonMobil to act on climate change [105] [106] [107] In 2018, it asked Russell 1000 companies to improve gender diversity on their board of directors if they had fewer than two women on them [108]\n\n\nInvestments in contributors to climate change\nGreenFaith activists protest BlackRock's shareholder meeting on May 31, 2022 Activists including director Fletcher Harper were arrested As of December 2018, BlackRock was the world's largest investor in coal-fired power stations, holding shares worth $11 billion in 56 companies in the industry [117] BlackRock owned more oil, gas, and thermal coal reserves than any other investment management company with total reserves amounting to 9.5 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions or 30% of total energy-related emissions from 2017 [118] Environmental groups including the Sierra Club, [119] as well as Amazon Watch, [120] launched a campaign in September 2018 called \"BlackRock's Big Problem\", [121] claiming that BlackRock is the \"biggest driver of climate destruction on the planet\", in part due to its opposition to fossil fuel divestment [121]\n\n\nInvestments in gun manufacturers\nIn May 2018, anti-gun protesters held a demonstration outside the company's annual general meeting in Manhattan [131] After discussions with firearms manufacturers and distributors, on April 5, 2018, BlackRock introduced two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that exclude stocks of gun makers and large gun retailers such as Walmart, Dick's Sporting Goods, Kroger, Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands, and Vista Outdoor, and removed the stocks from seven existing ESG funds [132] [133] [134]\n\n\nBlackRock study on integrating ESG into banking rules\nThe European Ombudsman opened an inquiry in May 2020 to inspect the commission's file on the European Commission's decision to award a contract to BlackRock to carry out a study on integrating environmental, social and governance risks and objectives into EU banking rules ('the prudential framework') European Parliament members questioned the impartiality of BlackRock given its investments in the sector [135] [136]\n\n\nU.S. states refusing to do business with BlackRock due to ESG policies\nRiley Moore, the state treasurer of West Virginia, said in June 2022 that BlackRock and five other financial institutions would no longer be allowed to do business with the state of West Virginia because of the company's advocacy against the fossil fuel industry [137] In October 2022, Louisiana removed $794 million from BlackRock due to the company's support of ESG and green energy [138] In December 2022, Jimmy Patronis, the chief financial officer of Florida, announced that the government of Florida would be divesting $2 billion worth of investments under management by BlackRock due to the firm's move to strengthen ESG standards and ESG policies [139] [140] BlackRock later responded to the announcement with a statement stating that the divestment would place politics over investor interest [141]\n\n\nCriticism of investments in China\nIn August 2021, BlackRock set up its first mutual fund in China after raising over one billion dollars from 111,000 Chinese investors BlackRock became the first foreign-owned company allowed by the Chinese government to operate a wholly-owned business in China's mutual fund industry [142] [143] [144] Writing in The Wall Street Journal, George Soros described BlackRock's initiative in China as a \"tragic mistake\" that would \"damage the national security interests of the U.S and other democracies.\" [145] [146] [147]\n\n\nTies with Federal Reserve\nBlackRock was scrutinized for allegedly taking advantage of its close ties with the Federal Reserve during the COVID-19 pandemic response efforts [154] [155] [156] In June 2020, The New Republic wrote that BlackRock \"was having a very good pandemic\" and was casting \"itself as socially responsible while contributing to the climate catastrophe, evading regulatory scrutiny, and angling to influence  [a potential] Biden administration.\" [89] The Financial Times described BlackRock as having secured a prominent advisory role in the Fed's post-COVID asset purchase program, prompting concerns over whether BlackRock would use its influence to encourage the Fed to purchase BlackRock products; during the Fed's 2020 quantitative easing program, BlackRock's corporate bond ETF received $4.3 billion in new investment, compared to the respective $33 million and $15 million received by BlackRock's competitors Vanguard Group and State Street [157] On May 26, 2020, the contract was released publicly The New York Times wrote about the contract that BlackRock \"will earn no more than $7.75 million per year for the main bond portfolio it will manage It will also be prohibited from earning fees on the sale of bond-backed exchange traded funds, a segment of the market it dominates.\" [158]\n\n\nInvestments in cryptocurrency\nAs of 2024, BlackRock operates the world's largest bitcoin fund [159]\n\n\nKey people\nAs of 2024, Blackrock has a 17-person board of directors, including: [161]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang":

[90]\n\n\nCommon ownership\n\"Common ownership\" is when competitors within a market are commonly owned In other words, these competitors can have the same powerful shareholders if their shares trade publicly Common ownership has the potential to cause harm because it reduces market competition, which can be bad for consumers and the economy In response to a widely cited research paper that showed that common ownership raises prices, [98] BlackRock issued a white paper calling the mechanism \"vague and implausible\" At the same time, the research’s findings was listed as a \"risk\" in

energy-related emissions from 2017 [118] Environmental groups including the Sierra Club, [119] as well as Amazon Watch, [120] launched a campaign in September 2018 called \"BlackRock's Big Problem\", [121] claiming that BlackRock is the \"biggest driver of climate destruction on the planet\", in part due to its opposition to fossil fuel divestment [121]\n\n\nInvestments in gun manufacturers\nIn May 2018, anti-gun protesters held a demonstration outside the company's annual general meeting in Manhattan [131] After discussions with firearms manufacturers and distributors, on April 5, 2018,

the company's support of ESG and green energy [138] In December 2022, Jimmy Patronis, the chief financial officer of Florida, announced that the government of Florida would be divesting $2 billion worth of investments under management by BlackRock due to the firm's move to strengthen ESG standards and ESG policies [139] [140] BlackRock later responded to the announcement with a statement

climate catastrophe, evading regulatory scrutiny, and angling to influence  [a potential] Biden administration.\" [89] The Financial Times described BlackRock as having secured a prominent advisory role in the Fed's post-COVID asset purchase program, prompting concerns over whether BlackRock would use its influence to encourage the Fed to purchase BlackRock products; during the Fed's 2020 quantitative easing program, BlackRock's corporate bond ETF received $4.3 billion in new investment, compared to the respective $33 million and $15 million received by BlackRock's competitors Vanguard Group and State Street [157] On May 26, 2020, the contract was released publicly The New York Times wrote about the contract that BlackRock \"will earn no more than $7.75 million per year for the main

Twitter, \"Big protest in D.C on January 6th Be there, will be wild!\" [13] [113] On December 28, far-right activist Ali Alexander described collaboration with the Proud Boys and explained the purpose

election, criticizing the media, and calling for Pence to overturn the election results [109] [212] His speech contained many falsehoods and misrepresentations that inflamed the crowd [213] Trump did not call on his supporters to use violence or enter the Capitol, [214] but his speech was filled with violent imagery [215] On social media, Trump was suggesting that his supporters had the power to prevent Biden from taking office [214] One of his tweets, posted on January 6, 2021, at 5:43 a.m., was \"Get smart Republicans FIGHT.\" [38] The same afternoon, Pence released a letter to Congress, in which he said he could not challenge Biden's victory [109] [216]\n\n\nAttack on the Capitol\nJust before the Proud Boys attacked the Capitol, pipe bombs were discovered near the complex [222] Proud

Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) all responded to the RNC bomb [231]\n\n\nAttack begins near Peace Monument, led by Proud Boys\nThe Proud Boys contingent reached the west perimeter of the Capitol grounds, which was protected only by a sparse line of police in front of a temporary fence Other Trump supporters arrived, adding to a growing crowd The Proud Boys tactically coordinated their attacks \"from the first moment of violence to multiple breaches of the Capitol while leaving the impression that it was just ordinary protesters leading the charge\" [242] Proud Boys targeted an access point and began to rile up the previously-peaceful crowd [242] In a \"tipping point\" moment, a man later identified as Ryan Samsel approached Joe Biggs and talked with him, even embracing him Samsel later told the FBI that Biggs \"encouraged him to push at the barricades and that when he hesitated, the Proud Boys leader flashed a gun, questioned his manhood and repeated his demand to move upfront and challenge the police\", according to The New York Times [243] Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola recalled seeing Biggs flash a handgun and goading Samsel, telling him to \"defend his manhood\" by attacking the police line, but later tried to retract this statement [244] As soon as that exchange ended, Samsel became the first to violently attack Capitol Police Capitol police officer Caroline Edwards described the attack:\n\n\nAttackers on west terrace breach Senate Wing hallway\nJust before 2:00 p.m., attackers reached the doors and windows of the Capitol and began attempts to break in

At 2:11, Proud Boy leader Dominic Pezzola used a stolen police riot shield to smash one of those un-reinforced windows on the west side of the Capitol, breaching the building itself By 2:13, the Capitol was officially breached [53] [7] [260] [261] Although most of the Capitol's windows had been reinforced, attackers targeted those that remained as single-pane glass and could be broken easily [257] Joe Biggs and other Proud Boy leaders had entered the Capitol by 2:14 [137] A news crew from British broadcaster ITV followed the rioters into the Capitol, the only broadcaster to do so [262] [263]\n\n\nEvacuation of leadership amid Capitol lockdown\nAt 2:13, the Senate recessed, [275] and the doors were locked A minute later, the rioters reached the doors to the gallery above the chamber

[333] He was \"initially pleased\" and refused to intercede when his supporters breached the Capitol [334] Staffers reported that Trump had been \"impossible to talk to throughout the day\" [335] Concerned that Trump may have committed treason through his actions, White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly advised administration officials to avoid contact with Trump and ignore any illegal orders that could further incite the attack, in order to limit their prosecutorial liability under the Sedition Act of 1918 [336]\n\n\nTrump's conduct\nTrump was in the West Wing of the White House at the time of the attack [333] He was \"initially pleased\" and refused to intercede when his supporters breached the Capitol [334] Staffers reported that Trump had been \"impossible to talk to throughout the day\" [335] Concerned that Trump may have committed treason through his actions, White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly advised administration officials to avoid contact with Trump and ignore any illegal orders that could further incite the attack, in order to limit their prosecutorial liability under the Sedition Act of 1918 [336]\n\n\nInflammatory speech while knowing of weapons\nDuring the \"Save America\" rally, Trump delivered a speech filled with violent imagery, despite knowing that some of his supporters were armed He demanded that armed supporters be allowed to enter the rally, and later instructed the crowd to march on the US Capitol [215] [347] In a December 21, 2021, statement, Trump falsely called the attack a \"completely unarmed protest\" The Department of Justice said in a January 2022 official statement that over 75 people had been charged, in relation to the attack, with entering a restricted area while armed with \"a dangerous or deadly weapon\", including some armed with guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes, and chemical sprays [348] According to testimony from Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, a Secret Service official had warned Trump that protestors were carrying weapons, but Trump wanted the magnetometers used to detect metallic weapons removed so armed supporters could enter the rally [349] According to Hutchinson, when warned, Trump said:\n\n\nAllegation of assaulting a Secret Service driver\nIn June 2022, Cassidy Hutchinson testified that she was told by then-White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato that after Trump got into the presidential SUV following his rally, hoping to drive to the Capitol as his supporters marched there, his lead Secret Service agent Robert Engel told him it was too dangerous and informed him they were returning to the White House Hutchinson said Ornato told her Trump became irate, attempted to grab the steering wheel of the vehicle, and lunged at Engel's clavicle [350] She testified Engel was present with Ornato as he related the incident but never contradicted the account [351] Three days after Hutchinson's testimony, CNN reported that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump's driver Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump \"tried to lunge over the seat – for what reason, nobody had any idea\", but no one asserted Trump attacked Engel A separate Secret Service official told CNN that Engel denied that Trump grabbed at the steering wheel or lunged toward an agent on his detail, and that Ornato denied telling Hutchinson that [352] The same day, Politico reported that during an early 2022 deposition Engel told the committee that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months [353] On July 14, 2022, CNN published a corroborating account by a Metropolitan Police officer in the motorcade, who told of the \"heated exchange\" Trump had with his Secret Service detail when they refused to take him to the Capitol following his rally on January 6 [354]\n\n\nEndangering Mike Pence\nOn January 5, after Vice President Mike Pence refused to participate in the fake electors plot, Trump warned that he would have to publicly criticize him This prompted Pence's chief of staff to become concerned for Pence's safety and to alert Pence's Secret Service detail to the perceived threat [88] [355] At 3:23 a.m on the morning of January 6, QAnon leader Ron Watkins posted a tweet accusing Pence of orchestrating a coup against Trump and linked to a blog post which called for \"the immediate arrest of  [Pence], for treason.\" [356] [357] [358]\n\n\nFailure to end the attack\nIn a televised January 6 Attack congressional hearing on June 9, 2022, congresspersons Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney stated that Trump did nothing to stop the attack despite numerous urgent requests that he intervene They described Trump's inaction as a \"dereliction of duty\" [367] Cheney said that Trump had attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy [368] [369] According to Representative Thompson, \"Jan 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan 6, to overthrow the government.. The violence was no accident It represents Trump's last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power.\" Trump, according to the committee, \"lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president\" [368] [369]\n\n\nCapitol Police leadership's failure to prepare\nCapitol Police leadership had not planned for a riot or attack, [371] and on January 6, under \"orders from leadership\", the force deployed without riot gear, shields, batons, or \"less lethal\" arms such as sting grenades Department riot shields had been improperly stored, causing them to shatter upon impact [170] Hundreds more Capitol Police could have been used, but they were not [260]\n\n\nDepartment of Defense leadership's refusal to send Guard\nOn January 3, acting defense secretary Miller had been ordered by Trump to \"do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators\" on January 6 [166] The following day, Miller issued orders which prohibited deploying D.C Guard members with weapons, helmets, body armor, or riot control agents without his personal approval [168] Prior to the attack Trump had floated the idea with his staff of deploying 10,000 National Guardsmen, though not to protect the Capitol, but rather \"to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counterprotesters\" [374]\n\n\nCongressional conduct\nDuring the attack, Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) posted information about the police response and the location of members on Twitter, including the fact that Speaker Pelosi had been taken out of the chamber, for which she has faced calls to resign for endangering members [384] [385] Boebert responded that she was not sharing private information since Pelosi's removal was also broadcast on TV [306]\n\n\nDeletion of Secret Service and Homeland Security text messages\nAs part of its investigation into the events of January 6, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General requested text messages from the Secret Service In response, the messages were deleted [387] [388] Text messages from Department of Homeland Security leaders Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli \"are missing from a key period leading up to the January 6 attack\" [389] Wolf's nomination had been withdrawn by the White House sometime on January 6 [390] A criminal investigation was opened into the deletion [391]\n\n\nParticipants, groups, and criminal charges\nBy November 2023, over 1,200 defendants had been charged for their role in the attack [37] The attackers included some of Trump's longtime and most fervent supporters from across the United States [392] The mob included Republican Party officials, current and former state legislators and political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, [392] conservative evangelical Christians, [i] and participants of the \"Save America\" Rally [393] According to the FBI, dozens of people on its terrorist watchlist were in D.C for pro-Trump events on the 6th, with the majority being \"suspected white supremacists\" [394] Some came heavily armed and some were convicted criminals, including a man who had been released from a Florida prison after serving a sentence for attempted murder [392]\n\n\nProud Boys\nThe Proud Boys played a much greater role in planning and coordinating the attack than was known in 2021 In 2022, new information appeared in testimony to the January 6th Committee and in a New York Times investigative video [247] Another key revelation about the Proud Boys' plans came from an informant and concerned Mike Pence:\n\n\nOath Keepers\nThe Oath Keepers are an American far-right [407] anti-government militia [407] [408] whose leaders have been convicted of violently opposing the government of the United States, including the transfer of presidential power as prescribed by the United States constitution It was incorporated in 2009 by founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes, a lawyer and former paratrooper In 2023, Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years for seditious conspiracy for his role in the attack, and another Oath Keepers leader, Kelly Meggs, was sentenced to 12 years for the same crime [409]\n\n\nQAnon\nQAnon is an American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in the American far-right political sphere in 2017 [418] QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\" Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, [419] [420] [421] cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump [425] Watchdogs studied QAnon posts and warned of the potential for violence ahead of January 6, 2021 [426] [427] [428] Multiple QAnon-affiliated protesters participated in the attack [429] [430] One participant, whose attire and behavior attracted worldwide media attention, was Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter nicknamed the \"QAnon Shaman\" [431] Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was shot dead by police as she was trying to break into the Speaker's Lobby, was a committed follower of QAnon [432] [433] The day before the attack, she had tweeted: \"the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours\" [434]\n\n\nWhite supremacists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates\nFar-right emblematic gear was worn by some participants, including neo-Confederate, Holocaust deniers, neo-Nazi and Völkisch-inspired neopagan apparel, as well as a shirt emblazoned with references to the Auschwitz concentration camp and its motto, Arbeit macht frei (\"Work sets you free\") [435] [394] [26] [436]\n\n\nOthers\nAlthough the anti-government Boogaloo movement mostly were opposed to Donald Trump, a Boogaloo follower said several groups under his command helped attack the Capitol, taking the opportunity to strike against the federal government [455] Also present during the attack were parts of the National Anarchist Movement and the Blue Lives Matter movement, supporters of the America First Movement, the Stop the Steal movement and the Patriot Movement, remnants of the Tea Party movement, the Three Percenters, the Groyper Army, Christian nationalists, and other far-right organizations and groups [26] Shirts with references to the internet meme Pepe the Frog were also seen, alongside \"1776\" and \"MAGA civil war 2021\" shirts, NSC-131 stickers, and the valknut symbol [456] Rioters were seen using the OK gesture, a gesture that had been famously co-opted as an alt-right symbol Christian imagery, including a large \"Jesus saves\" banner, was seen in the crowd of demonstrators Various other iconography was also on display, such as flags of other countries [k]\n\n\nPolice and military connections\nPolitico reported that some rioters briefly showed their police badges or military identification to law enforcement as they approached the Capitol, expecting to be let inside; a Capitol Police officer told BuzzFeed News that one rioter had told him \" [w]e're doing this for you\" as he flashed a badge [371] One former police officer, Laura Steele, was convicted for breaching the Capitol with fellow Oath Keepers [466]\n\n\nAnalysis\nIn February 2021, an academic analysis in The Atlantic found that of the 193 persons so far arrested for invading the Capitol, 89 percent had no clear public connection to established far-right militias, known white-nationalist gangs, or any other known militant organizations \"The overwhelming reason for action, cited again and again in court documents, was that arrestees were following Trump's orders to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the presidential-election winner\" They were older than participants in previous far-right violent demonstrations and more likely to be employed, with 40% being business owners The researchers concluded that these \"middle-aged, middle-class insurrectionists\" represented \"a new force in American politics – not merely a mix of right-wing organizations, but a broader mass political movement that has violence at its core and draws strength even from places where Trump supporters are in the minority\" [474]\n\n\nResults\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nCasualties and suicides\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nDamage\nRioters stormed the offices of Nancy Pelosi, flipping tables and ripping photos from walls; [308] [309] the office of the Senate Parliamentarian was ransacked; [285] art was looted; [7] and feces was tracked into several hallways [508] [19] [509] Windows were smashed throughout the building, leaving the floor littered with glass and debris [7] [510] Rioters damaged, turned over, or stole furniture [510] One door had \"Murder the Media\" scribbled onto it in all-caps [511] Rioters damaged Associated Press recording and broadcasting equipment outside the Capitol after chasing away reporters [512] Rioters also destroyed a display honoring the life of congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis [513] [514] A photo of Representative Andy Kim cleaning up the litter in the rotunda after midnight went viral [515]\n\n\nLaptop theft and cybersecurity concerns\nA laptop owned by Senator Jeff Merkley was stolen [520] A laptop taken from Pelosi's office was a \"laptop from a conference room .. that was only used for presentations\", according to Pelosi's deputy chief of staff [20] Representative Ruben Gallego said, \"we have to do a full review of what was taken, or copied, or even left behind in terms of bugs and listening devices\" [371] Military news website SOFREP reported that \"several\" secret‑level laptops were stolen, some of which had been abandoned while still logged in to SIPRNet, causing authorities to temporarily shut down SIPRNet for a security update on January 7 and leading the United States Army Special Operations Command to re-authorize all SIPRNet-connected computers on January 8 [521] [522]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of conviction, with every Democrat and seven Republicans voting to convict, but two-thirds of the Senate (67 votes) are required to convict [525] Many in the Trump administration resigned Several large companies [526] announced they were halting all political donations, and others have suspended funding the lawmakers who had objected to certifying Electoral College results [527] A bill was introduced to form an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the events surrounding the attack; it passed the House but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate [528] The House then approved a House \"select committee\" to investigate the attack [529] In June, the Senate released the results of its own investigation of the attack The event led to strong criticism of law enforcement agencies Leading figures within the United States Capitol Police resigned [530] [531]\nA large-scale criminal investigation was undertaken, with the FBI opening more than 1,200 case files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nPolitical, legal, and social repercussions\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of

files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn the aftermath of the attack, after drawing widespread condemnation from the U.S Congress, members of his administration, and the media, 45th U.S President Donald Trump released a video-taped statement on January 7, reportedly to stop the resignations of his staff and the threats of impeachment or removal from office In the statement, he condemned the violence at the U.S Capitol, saying that \"a new administration will be inaugurated\", which was widely seen as a concession, and his \"focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power\" to the Joe Biden administration [554] [555] Vanity Fair reported that Trump was at least partially convinced to make the statement by U.S Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who told Trump a sufficient number of Senate Republicans would support removing him from office unless he conceded [556] Kayleigh McEnany, the White House Press Secretary, had attempted to distance the administration from the rioters' behavior in a televised statement earlier in the day [557] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump had told White House aides he regretted committing to an orderly transition of power and would never resign from office [558] In a March 25 interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Capitol attackers, saying they were patriots who posed \"zero threat\", and he criticized law enforcement for \"persecuting\" the rioters [559]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nMore than seventy countries and international organizations expressed their concerns over the attack and condemned the violence, with some specifically condemning President Donald Trump's own role in inciting the attack [594] [595] Foreign leaders, diplomats, politicians, and institutions expressed shock, outrage, and condemnation of the events [596] [597] Multiple world leaders made a call for peace, describing the assault as \"an attack on democracy\" [598] The leaders of some countries, including Brazil, Poland, and Hungary, declined to condemn the situation, and described it as an internal U.S affair [599]\n\n\n14th Amendment disqualification\nIn late 2022 Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election Some legal scholars have argued that Trump should be barred from presidential office under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because of his apparent support for the attack [601] Three states, Maine, Colorado, and Illinois, issued rulings to disqualify Trump from appearing on election ballots Trump appealed their decisions in Trump v Anderson The Supreme Court heard the case on February 8, 2024, and unanimously ruled on March 4, 2024 that states could not remove Trump from the ballot [25]\n\n\nSarbanes–Oxley Act prosecutions ruling and impact\nOn June 28, 2024, the U.S Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, ruled in favor of defendant Joseph Fischer and found that a provision the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act could not be used to bring obstruction charges against January 6 defendants [603] Soon after the ruling, more January 6 prosecution cases would be reopened [604]\n\n\nAnalysis and terminology\nA week following the attack, journalists were searching for an appropriate word to describe the event [605] According to the Associated Press, U.S media outlets first described the developments on January 6 as \"a rally or protest\", but as the events of the day escalated and further reporting and images emerged, the descriptions shifted to \"an assault, a riot, an insurrection, domestic terrorism or even a coup attempt\" [606] It was variably observed that the media outlets were settling on the terms \"riot\" and \"insurrection\" [606] [607] According to NPR, \"By definition, 'insurrection', and its derivative, 'insurgency', are accurate 'Riot' and 'mob' are equally correct While these words are not interchangeable, they are all suitable when describing Jan 6.\" [608] The New York Times assessed the event as having brought the United States \"hours away from a full-blown constitutional crisis\" [609] Brian Stelter in CNN Business wrote that the events of the Capitol attack \"will be remembered as an act of domestic terrorism against the United States\" [610]\n\n\nHistorians' perspectives\nWhile there have been other instances of violence at the Capitol in the 19th and 20th centuries, this event was the most severe assault on the building since the 1814 burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812 The last attempt on the life of the vice president was a bomb plot against Thomas Marshall in July 1915 [634] For the first time in U.S history, a Confederate battle flag was flown inside the Capitol The Confederate States Army had never reached the Capitol, nor come closer than 6 miles (10 km) from the Capitol at the Battle of Fort Stevens, during the American Civil War [442] [o]\n\n\nSee also\nHouse

Twitter, \"Big protest in D.C on January 6th Be there, will be wild!\" [13] [113] On December 28, far-right activist Ali Alexander described collaboration with the Proud Boys and explained the purpose of the January 6 event would be \"to build momentum and pressure, and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congresspeoples   [sic] who weren't yet decided or saw everyone outside and said, 'I can't be on the other side of that mob'\" [114] Alexander named three Republican members of the House as allies who were planning \"something big\": Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks [115] \"We're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event\", he said [116]\n\n\nSeditious conspiracy by Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\nOn November 5, two days after the presidential election, leaders of the Oath Keepers began communicating about a \"civil war\" On November 9, the leaders held a members-only online conference in which leader Stewart Rhodes outlined a plan to stop the transfer of power, including preparations for using force The Oath Keepers planned to store \"an arsenal\" with a \"Quick Reaction Force\" (QRF) in nearby Alexandria, Virginia The leaders planned to procure boat transportation so bridge closures could not prevent their entry into D.C [127] [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nPredictions of violence\nThe weeks preceding January 6 were filled with predictions of violence by Trump supporters The attack was later said to be \"planned in plain sight\", with postings on social media even planning for violence on January 6 In response to widespread predictions of violence, D.C food and lodging establishments with a history of being patronized by the Proud Boys announced temporary closures in an attempt to protect public safety, and the mayor advised residents to stay away from areas near the Mall that might see violence Members of Congress interfaced with law enforcement to ensure preparations were being made for any upcoming violence.\n\n\nLaw enforcement and National Guard preparations\nOn November 9, Trump fired Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and replaced him with Christopher C Miller [157] [158] [159] [160] In response, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Gina Haspel told Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley \"we are on the way to a right-wing coup\" [161] On December 18, Miller unilaterally terminated the Department of Defense's transition to the incoming administration, falsely claiming it was a mutually-agreed pause for the holidays [162] [163]\n\n\nTrump supporters gather in D.C.\nOn January 5, several events related to overturning the election occurred on or near the National Mall in Washington, D.C., at places such as Freedom Plaza, the North Inner Gravel Walkway between 13th and 14th Streets, Area 9 across from the Russell Senate Office Building, and near the United States Supreme Court [171] [172] On the night of January 5 and into the morning of January 6, at least ten people were arrested,

sons Donald Jr and Eric, met at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C [182] [183] Tuberville has since said that he did not attend the meeting, [184] despite having been photographed in the hotel's lobby [182] [185] According to Charles Herbster, who said he attended the meeting himself, attendees included Tuberville, Adam Piper, and Peter Navarro Daniel Beck wrote that \"Fifteen of us spent the evening with Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lindell, Peter Navarro, and Rudy Giuliani\" [186] Herbster claimed to be standing \"in the private residence of the President at Trump International with the following patriots who are joining me in a battle for justice and truth\" He added David Bossie to the list of attendees [182]\n\n\nBombs placed\nAt 7:40 p.m on January 5, someone wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask, and Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers was filmed carrying a bag through a residential neighborhood on South Capitol Street At 7:52 p.m., the individual was recorded sitting on a bench outside the DNC; the next day, a pipe bomb was discovered there, placed under a bush In the footage, the suspect appears to zip a bag, stand and walk away At 8:14, the suspect was filmed in an alley near the RNC, where a second pipe bomb was found the following day [188] Both bombs were placed within a few blocks of the Capitol [189] [190] Nearing the second anniversary of the incident, a reward of $500,000 was being offered, [191] but as of the third anniversary, no suspects have been named [192] [193] [194]\n\n\nJanuary 6 Trump rally\nOn January 6, the \"Save America\" rally (or \"March to Save America\", promoted as a \"Save America March\") [195] took place on the Ellipse within the National Mall just south of the White House The permit granted to Women for America First scheduled a first amendment rally \"March for Trump\", with speeches running from 9:00 a.m to 3:30 p.m., with an additional hour for the conclusion of the rally and dispersal of participants [171]\n\n\nTrump's speech\nStarting at 11:58, from behind a bulletproof shield, President Trump gave a speech, declaring that he would \"never concede\" the election, criticizing the media, and calling for Pence to overturn the election results [109] [212] His speech contained many falsehoods and misrepresentations that inflamed the crowd [213] Trump did not call on his supporters to use violence or enter the Capitol, [214] but his speech was filled with violent imagery [215] On social media, Trump was suggesting that his supporters had the power to prevent Biden from taking office [214] One of his tweets, posted on January 6, 2021, at 5:43 a.m., was \"Get smart Republicans FIGHT.\" [38] The same afternoon, Pence released a letter to Congress, in which he said he could not challenge Biden's victory [109] [216]\n\n\nAttack on the Capitol\nJust before the Proud Boys attacked the Capitol, pipe bombs were discovered near the complex [222] Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other attackers besieged and ultimately breached the Capitol Members of the Congress barricaded themselves in the chamber, and one attacker was fatally shot by police while attempting to breach a barricade [223]\n\n\nProud Boys march to Capitol as mob assembles\nAt 10:30, over a hundred Proud Boys left the Washington Monument, led by Ethan Nordean and Joe Biggs By 11:52, the group had reached the Capitol and proceeded to walk around the building before doubling back to the west side, which allowed them to assess building defenses and to look for weaknesses [225] [85] [226]\n\n\nBombs discovered near Capitol Complex\nAround 12:45 p.m., a bomb was discovered next to a building containing Republican National Committee (RNC) offices by a woman using the shared alleyway to access her apartment building's laundry room [230] She alerted RNC security, which investigated and summoned law enforcement; U.S Capitol Police, FBI agents and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) all responded to the RNC bomb [231]\n\n\nAttack begins near Peace Monument, led by Proud Boys\nThe Proud Boys contingent reached the west perimeter of the Capitol grounds, which was protected only by a sparse line of police in front of a temporary fence Other Trump supporters arrived, adding to a growing crowd The Proud Boys tactically coordinated their attacks \"from the first moment of violence to multiple breaches of the Capitol while leaving the impression that it was just ordinary protesters leading the charge\" [242] Proud Boys targeted an access point and began to rile up the previously-peaceful crowd [242] In a \"tipping point\" moment, a man later identified as Ryan Samsel approached Joe Biggs and talked with him, even embracing him Samsel later told the FBI that Biggs \"encouraged him to push at the barricades and that when he hesitated, the Proud Boys leader flashed a gun, questioned his manhood and repeated his demand to move upfront and challenge the police\", according to The New York Times [243] Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola recalled seeing Biggs flash a handgun and goading Samsel, telling him to \"defend his manhood\" by attacking the police line, but later tried to retract this statement [244] As soon as that exchange ended, Samsel became the first to violently attack Capitol Police Capitol police officer Caroline Edwards described the attack:\n\n\nAttackers on west terrace breach Senate Wing hallway\nJust before 2:00 p.m., attackers reached the doors and windows of the Capitol and began attempts to break in The Los Angeles Times observed that \"whether by sheer luck, real-time trial and error, or advance knowledge\", the first attackers to break through the police line onto the upper west terrace ran past 15 reinforced windows, \"making a beeline\" for the recessed area near the Senate where two unreinforced windows and two doors with unreinforced glass were the only protection from attack [257] At 2:11, Proud Boy leader Dominic Pezzola used a stolen police riot shield to smash one of those un-reinforced windows on the west side of the Capitol, breaching the building itself By 2:13, the Capitol was officially breached [53] [7] [260] [261] Although most of the Capitol's windows had been reinforced, attackers targeted those that remained as single-pane glass and could be broken easily [257] Joe Biggs and other Proud Boy leaders had entered the Capitol by 2:14 [137] A news crew from British broadcaster ITV followed the rioters into the Capitol, the only broadcaster to do so [262] [263]\n\n\nEvacuation of leadership amid Capitol lockdown\nAt 2:13, the Senate recessed, [275] and the doors were locked A minute later, the rioters reached the doors to the gallery above the chamber [253] [276] Banging could be heard from outside as rioters attempted to break through the doors Meanwhile, in the House chamber, Speaker Pelosi was escorted out of the chamber [277] [278]\n\n\nOath Keepers arrive and breach Rotunda\nShortly after 2:00, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes arrived on the restricted Capitol grounds At 2:30, a team of Oath Keepers (\"Stack One\", which included Meggs, Harrelson, Watkins, Hackett, and Moerschel), clad in paramilitary clothing, marched in a stack formation up the east steps of the Capitol to join the mob already besieging the Capitol At 2:38, those doors to the Capitol Rotunda were breached, and \"Stack One\" entered the building alongside other attackers A second group (\"Stack Two\") entered the Capitol through those same doors at 3:15 [127] Throughout the attack, Oath Keepers maintained a \"Quick reaction Force\" ready to deliver an arsenal to the group if called upon [127] [311] [312]\n\n\nAshli Babbitt killed by police while attempting to breach Speaker's Lobby\nAt 2:44 p.m., law enforcement near the House Chamber was trying to \"defend two fronts\", and \"a lot of members  [of Congress] and staff that were in danger at the time\" [313] [314] While some lawmakers remained trapped in the House gallery, [315] House members and staff from the floor were being evacuated by Capitol Police, protected from the attackers by a barricaded door with glass windows [295]\n\n\nAttack on the Tunnel\nAround 3:15, MPD officer Daniel Hodges was crushed in a door while defending the Capitol tunnel from attackers One of his attackers was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison [324] [325]\n\n\nPolice clear the Capitol and Congress reconvenes\nA combined force of Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police began a joint operation to clear the Capitol By 2:49, the Crypt was cleared, and the mob outside the Speaker's Lobby was cleared by 2:57 At 3:25, law enforcement, including a line of MPD officers in full riot gear, proceeded to clear the Rotunda; and by 3:40, rioters had mostly been pushed out onto West Plaza [74]: ch 8 \n\n\nFederal officials' conduct\nTrump was in the West Wing of the White House at the time of the attack [333] He was \"initially pleased\" and refused to intercede when his supporters breached the Capitol [334] Staffers reported that Trump had been \"impossible to talk to throughout the day\" [335] Concerned that Trump may have committed treason through his actions, White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly advised administration officials to avoid contact with Trump and ignore any illegal orders that could further incite the attack, in order to limit their prosecutorial liability under the Sedition Act of 1918 [336]\n\n\nTrump's conduct\nTrump was in the West Wing of the White House at the time of the attack [333] He was \"initially pleased\" and refused to intercede when his supporters breached the Capitol [334] Staffers reported that Trump had been \"impossible to talk to throughout the day\" [335] Concerned that Trump may have committed treason through his actions, White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly advised administration officials to avoid contact with Trump and ignore any illegal orders that could further incite the attack, in order to limit their prosecutorial liability under the Sedition Act of 1918 [336]\n\n\nInflammatory speech while knowing of weapons\nDuring the \"Save America\" rally, Trump delivered a speech filled with violent imagery, despite knowing that some of his supporters were armed He demanded that armed supporters be allowed to enter the rally, and later instructed the crowd to march on the US Capitol [215] [347] In a December 21, 2021, statement, Trump falsely called the attack a \"completely unarmed protest\" The Department of Justice said in a January 2022 official statement that over 75 people had been charged, in relation to the attack, with entering a restricted area while armed with \"a dangerous or deadly weapon\", including some armed with guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes, and chemical sprays [348] According to testimony from Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, a Secret Service official had warned Trump that protestors were carrying weapons, but Trump wanted the magnetometers used to detect metallic weapons removed so armed supporters could enter the rally [349] According to Hutchinson, when warned, Trump said:\n\n\nAllegation of assaulting a Secret Service driver\nIn June 2022, Cassidy Hutchinson testified that she was told by then-White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato that after Trump got into the presidential SUV following his rally, hoping to drive to the Capitol as his supporters marched there, his lead Secret Service agent Robert Engel told him it was too dangerous and informed him they were returning to the White House Hutchinson said Ornato told her Trump became irate, attempted to grab the steering wheel of the vehicle, and lunged at Engel's clavicle [350] She testified Engel was present with Ornato as he related the incident but never contradicted the account [351] Three days after Hutchinson's testimony, CNN reported that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump's driver Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump \"tried to lunge over the seat – for what reason, nobody had any idea\", but no one asserted Trump attacked Engel A separate Secret Service official told CNN that Engel denied that Trump grabbed at the steering wheel or lunged toward an agent on his detail, and that Ornato denied telling Hutchinson that [352] The same day, Politico reported that during an early 2022 deposition Engel told the committee that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months [353] On July 14, 2022, CNN published a corroborating account by a Metropolitan Police officer in the motorcade, who told of the \"heated exchange\" Trump had with his Secret Service detail when they refused to take him to the Capitol following his rally on January 6 [354]\n\n\nEndangering Mike Pence\nOn January 5, after Vice President Mike Pence refused to participate in the fake electors plot, Trump warned that he would have to publicly criticize him This prompted Pence's chief of staff to become concerned for Pence's safety and to alert Pence's Secret Service detail to the perceived threat [88] [355] At 3:23 a.m on the morning of January 6, QAnon leader Ron Watkins posted a tweet accusing Pence of orchestrating a coup against Trump and linked to a blog post which called for \"the immediate arrest of  [Pence], for treason.\" [356] [357] [358]\n\n\nFailure to end the attack\nIn a televised January 6 Attack congressional hearing on June 9, 2022, congresspersons Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney stated that Trump did nothing to stop the attack despite numerous urgent requests that he intervene They described Trump's inaction as a \"dereliction of duty\" [367] Cheney said that Trump had attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy [368] [369] According to Representative Thompson, \"Jan 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan 6, to overthrow the government.. The violence was no accident It represents Trump's last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power.\" Trump, according to the committee, \"lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president\" [368] [369]\n\n\nCapitol Police leadership's failure to prepare\nCapitol Police leadership had not planned for a riot or attack, [371] and on January 6, under \"orders from leadership\", the force deployed without riot gear, shields, batons, or \"less lethal\" arms such as sting grenades Department riot shields had been improperly stored, causing them to shatter upon impact [170] Hundreds more Capitol Police could have been used, but they were not [260]\n\n\nDepartment of Defense leadership's refusal to send Guard\nOn January 3, acting defense secretary Miller had been ordered by Trump to \"do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators\" on January 6 [166] The following day, Miller issued orders which prohibited deploying D.C Guard members with weapons, helmets, body armor, or riot control agents without his personal approval [168] Prior to the attack Trump had floated the idea with his staff of deploying 10,000 National Guardsmen, though not to protect the Capitol, but rather \"to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counterprotesters\" [374]\n\n\nCongressional conduct\nDuring the attack, Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) posted information about the police response and the location of members on Twitter, including the fact that Speaker Pelosi had been taken out of the chamber, for which she has faced calls to resign for endangering members [384] [385] Boebert responded that she was not sharing private information since Pelosi's removal was also broadcast on TV [306]\n\n\nDeletion of Secret Service and Homeland Security text messages\nAs part of its investigation into the events of January 6, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General requested text messages from the Secret Service In response, the messages were deleted [387] [388] Text messages from Department of Homeland Security leaders Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli \"are missing from a key period leading up to the January 6 attack\" [389] Wolf's nomination had been withdrawn by the White House sometime on January 6 [390] A criminal investigation was opened into the deletion [391]\n\n\nParticipants, groups, and criminal charges\nBy November 2023, over 1,200 defendants had been charged for their role in the attack [37] The attackers included some of Trump's longtime and most fervent supporters from across the United States [392] The mob included Republican Party officials, current and former state legislators and political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, [392] conservative evangelical Christians, [i] and participants of the \"Save America\" Rally [393] According to the FBI, dozens of people on its terrorist watchlist were in D.C for pro-Trump events on the 6th, with the majority being \"suspected white supremacists\" [394] Some came heavily armed and some were convicted criminals, including a man who had been released from a Florida prison after serving a sentence for attempted murder [392]\n\n\nProud Boys\nThe Proud Boys played a much greater role in planning and coordinating the attack than was known in 2021 In 2022, new information appeared in testimony to the January 6th Committee and in a New York Times investigative video [247] Another key revelation about the Proud Boys' plans came from an informant and concerned Mike Pence:\n\n\nOath Keepers\nThe Oath Keepers are an American far-right [407] anti-government militia [407] [408] whose leaders have been convicted of violently opposing the government of the United States, including the transfer of presidential power as prescribed by the United States constitution It was incorporated in 2009 by founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes, a lawyer and former paratrooper In 2023, Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years for seditious conspiracy for his role in the attack, and another Oath Keepers leader, Kelly Meggs, was sentenced to 12 years for the same crime [409]\n\n\nQAnon\nQAnon is an American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in the American far-right political sphere in 2017 [418] QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\" Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, [419] [420] [421] cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump [425] Watchdogs studied QAnon posts and warned of the potential for violence ahead of January 6, 2021 [426] [427] [428] Multiple QAnon-affiliated protesters participated in the attack [429] [430] One participant, whose attire and behavior attracted worldwide media attention, was Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter nicknamed the \"QAnon Shaman\" [431] Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was shot dead by police as she was trying to break into the Speaker's Lobby, was a committed follower of QAnon [432] [433] The day before the attack, she had tweeted: \"the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours\" [434]\n\n\nWhite supremacists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates\nFar-right emblematic gear was worn by some participants, including neo-Confederate, Holocaust deniers, neo-Nazi and Völkisch-inspired neopagan apparel, as well as a shirt emblazoned with references to the Auschwitz concentration camp and its motto, Arbeit macht frei (\"Work sets you free\") [435] [394] [26] [436]\n\n\nOthers\nAlthough the anti-government Boogaloo movement mostly were opposed to Donald Trump, a Boogaloo follower said several groups under his command helped attack the Capitol, taking the opportunity to strike against the federal government [455] Also present during the attack were parts of the National Anarchist Movement and the Blue Lives Matter movement, supporters of the America First Movement, the Stop the Steal movement and the Patriot Movement, remnants of the Tea Party movement, the Three Percenters, the Groyper Army, Christian nationalists, and other far-right organizations and groups [26] Shirts with references to the internet meme Pepe the Frog were also seen, alongside \"1776\" and \"MAGA civil war 2021\" shirts, NSC-131 stickers, and the valknut symbol [456] Rioters were seen using the OK gesture, a gesture that had been famously co-opted as an alt-right symbol Christian imagery, including a large \"Jesus saves\" banner, was seen in the crowd of demonstrators Various other iconography was also on display, such as flags of other countries [k]\n\n\nPolice and military connections\nPolitico reported that some rioters briefly showed their police badges or military identification to law enforcement as they approached the Capitol, expecting to be let inside; a Capitol Police officer told BuzzFeed News that one rioter had told him \" [w]e're doing this for you\" as he flashed a badge [371] One former police officer, Laura Steele, was convicted for breaching the Capitol with fellow Oath Keepers [466]\n\n\nAnalysis\nIn February 2021, an academic analysis in The Atlantic found that of the 193 persons so far arrested for invading the Capitol, 89 percent had no clear public connection to established far-right militias, known white-nationalist gangs, or any other known militant organizations \"The overwhelming reason for action, cited again and again in court documents, was that arrestees were following Trump's orders to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the presidential-election winner\" They were older than participants in previous far-right violent demonstrations and more likely to be employed, with 40% being business owners The researchers concluded that these \"middle-aged, middle-class insurrectionists\" represented \"a new force in American politics – not merely a mix of right-wing organizations, but a broader mass political movement that has violence at its core and draws strength even from places where Trump supporters are in the minority\" [474]\n\n\nResults\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nCasualties and suicides\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nDamage\nRioters stormed the offices of Nancy Pelosi, flipping tables and ripping photos from walls; [308] [309] the office of the Senate Parliamentarian was ransacked; [285] art was looted; [7] and feces was tracked into several hallways [508] [19] [509] Windows were smashed throughout the building, leaving the floor littered with glass and debris [7] [510] Rioters damaged, turned over, or stole furniture [510] One door had \"Murder the Media\" scribbled onto it in all-caps [511] Rioters damaged Associated Press recording and broadcasting equipment outside the Capitol after chasing away reporters [512] Rioters also destroyed a display honoring the life of congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis [513] [514] A photo of Representative Andy Kim cleaning up the litter in the rotunda after midnight went viral [515]\n\n\nLaptop theft and cybersecurity concerns\nA laptop owned by Senator Jeff Merkley was stolen [520] A laptop taken from Pelosi's office was a \"laptop from a conference room .. that was only used for presentations\", according to Pelosi's deputy chief of staff [20] Representative Ruben Gallego said, \"we have to do a full review of what was taken, or copied, or even left behind in terms of bugs and listening devices\" [371] Military news website SOFREP reported that \"several\" secret‑level laptops were stolen, some of which had been abandoned while still logged in to SIPRNet, causing authorities to temporarily shut down SIPRNet for a security update on January 7 and leading the United States Army Special Operations Command to re-authorize all SIPRNet-connected computers on January 8 [521] [522]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of conviction, with every Democrat and seven Republicans voting to convict, but two-thirds of the Senate (67 votes) are required to convict [525] Many in the Trump administration resigned Several large companies [526] announced they were halting all political donations, and others have suspended funding the lawmakers who had objected to certifying Electoral College results [527] A bill was introduced to form an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the events surrounding the attack; it passed the House but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate [528] The House then approved a House \"select committee\" to investigate the attack [529] In June, the Senate released the results of its own investigation of the attack The event led to strong criticism of law enforcement agencies Leading figures within the United States Capitol Police resigned [530] [531]\nA large-scale criminal investigation was undertaken, with the FBI opening more than 1,200 case files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nPolitical, legal, and social repercussions\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of

files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn the aftermath of the attack, after drawing widespread condemnation from the U.S Congress, members of his administration, and the media, 45th U.S President Donald Trump released a video-taped statement on January 7, reportedly to stop the resignations of his staff and the threats of impeachment or removal from office In the statement, he condemned the violence at the U.S Capitol, saying that \"a new administration will be inaugurated\", which was widely seen as a concession, and his \"focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power\" to the Joe Biden administration [554] [555] Vanity Fair reported that Trump was at least partially convinced to make the statement by U.S Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who told Trump a sufficient number of Senate Republicans would support removing him from office unless he conceded [556] Kayleigh McEnany, the White House Press Secretary, had attempted to distance the administration from the rioters' behavior in a televised statement earlier in the day [557] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump had told White House aides he regretted committing to an orderly transition of power and would never resign from office [558] In a March 25 interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Capitol attackers, saying they were patriots who posed \"zero threat\", and he criticized law enforcement for \"persecuting\" the rioters [559]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nMore than seventy countries and international organizations expressed their concerns over the attack and condemned the violence, with some specifically condemning President Donald Trump's own role in inciting the attack [594] [595] Foreign leaders, diplomats, politicians, and institutions expressed shock, outrage, and condemnation of the events [596] [597] Multiple world leaders made a call for peace, describing the assault as \"an attack on democracy\" [598] The leaders of some countries, including Brazil, Poland, and Hungary, declined to condemn the situation, and described it as an internal U.S affair [599]\n\n\n14th Amendment disqualification\nIn late 2022 Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election Some legal scholars have argued that Trump should be barred from presidential office under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because of his apparent support for the attack [601] Three states, Maine, Colorado, and Illinois, issued rulings to disqualify Trump from appearing on election ballots Trump appealed their decisions in Trump v Anderson The Supreme Court heard the case on February 8, 2024, and unanimously ruled on March 4, 2024 that states could not remove Trump from the ballot [25]\n\n\nSarbanes–Oxley Act prosecutions ruling and impact\nOn June 28, 2024, the U.S Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, ruled in favor of defendant Joseph Fischer and found that a provision the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act could not be used to bring obstruction charges against January 6 defendants [603] Soon after the ruling, more January 6 prosecution cases would be reopened [604]\n\n\nAnalysis and terminology\nA week following the attack, journalists were searching for an appropriate word to describe the event [605] According to the Associated Press, U.S media outlets first described the developments on January 6 as \"a rally or protest\", but as the events of the day escalated and further reporting and images emerged, the descriptions shifted to \"an assault, a riot, an insurrection, domestic terrorism or even a coup attempt\" [606] It was variably observed that the media outlets were settling on the terms \"riot\" and \"insurrection\" [606] [607] According to NPR, \"By definition, 'insurrection', and its derivative, 'insurgency', are accurate 'Riot' and 'mob' are equally correct While these words are not interchangeable, they are all suitable when describing Jan 6.\" [608] The New York Times assessed the event as having brought the United States \"hours away from a full-blown constitutional crisis\" [609] Brian Stelter in CNN Business wrote that the events of the Capitol attack \"will be remembered as an act of domestic terrorism against the United States\" [610]\n\n\nHistorians' perspectives\nWhile there have been other instances of violence at the Capitol in the 19th and 20th centuries, this event was the most severe assault on the building since the 1814 burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812 The last attempt on the life of the vice president was a bomb plot against Thomas Marshall in July 1915 [634] For the first time in U.S history, a Confederate battle flag was flown inside the Capitol The Confederate States Army had never reached the Capitol, nor come closer than 6 miles (10 km) from the Capitol at the Battle of Fort Stevens, during the American Civil War [442] [o]\n\n\nSee also\nHouse

The show was created by Bill Dubuque and developed by Chris Mundy. It stars Jason Bateman and Laura Linney as the main characters, Marty and Wendy Byrde, a financial advisor and his wife who are forced to relocate their family to the Ozarks after Marty is involved in a money laundering scheme.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe series follows the story of Marty Byrde, a financial advisor who works for a Chicago-based money laundering operation for a Mexican drug cartel. However, when Marty's partner is killed and he is forced to flee with his wife Wendy and their two children, he proposes to set up a new money laundering operation in the Lake of the Ozarks region of central Missouri. The family moves from their suburban home in Chicago to a more rural area, where they become entangled in the local crime scene and must navigate the complexities of their new lives.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe main cast of the show includes Jason Bateman as Marty Byrde, a financial advisor who is forced to relocate his family to the Ozarks; Laura Linney as Wendy Byrde, Marty's wife who is also involved in the money laundering operation; Julia Garner as Ruth Radewald, a young woman who becomes involved in the Byrdes' operation; Peter Mullan as Jacob Snell, a local crime boss who becomes a major player in the Byrdes' lives; and Lisa Emery as Darlene Snell, Jacob's wife who is also involved in the local crime scene.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe series was produced by MRC, a production company that is known for producing several popular television shows, including The Good Wife and This Is Us. The show was filmed in various locations in the Atlanta area, including Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier, which were used to represent the Lake of the Ozarks.

The quartered circle of the \"O\" contains four symbols that foreshadow the main plot points of each episode. Each of these hand-drawn symbolic images is formed to represent the remaining letters in \"Ozark\".\n\n**Filming**\n\nMost of the shooting locations are in the Atlanta area at Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier, rather than at the Lake of the Ozarks, because of tax breaks offered by Georgia.

Born in Hinsdale, Illinois, Harris grew up in Bolingbrook, Illinois, and attended Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, where he was a member of the cheerleading team.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJerry Harris was born in Hinsdale, Illinois. His family later moved to Bolingbrook, Illinois, where he spent most of his childhood. When Harris was 16 years old, his mother passed away due to lung cancer. This difficult experience had a significant impact on Harris, and he has spoken publicly about the emotional challenges he faced during this time.\n\nHarris attended Waubonsie Valley High School in Aurora, Illinois. He was an active member of the school's cheerleading team and developed a passion for the sport. After graduating from high school, Harris went on to attend Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, where he joined the college's highly competitive cheerleading team.\n\nDuring his time at Navarro College, Harris was coached by Monica Aldama, a renowned cheerleading coach who has won numerous national championships. Harris was a member of the team that competed at the National Cheerleading Association (NCA) National Championships, where they finished in the top three.\n\nIn addition to his cheerleading achievements, Harris also received academic recognition. In the season one finale of \"Cheer,\" he received a Regional Scholars Award from the University of Louisville. Harris attended the university for the fall semester but ultimately returned to Navarro College.\n\n**Career**\n\nHarris's rise to fame began when he appeared on the Netflix documentary series \"Cheer\" in 2020. The show followed the Navarro College cheerleading team as they prepared for the NCA National Championships. Harris's charismatic personality and unique cheerleading style quickly made him a fan favorite.\n\nIn January 2020, Harris appeared on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" alongside other members of the \"Cheer\" cast. The segment featured Harris's energetic and entertaining personality, showcasing his signature \"mat talk,\" a cheerleading term in which he yells and cheers on other people.\n\nIn February 2020, Ellen DeGeneres announced that Harris would be the show's Oscars correspondent. Harris covered the event, providing live updates and commentary throughout the night.\n\nHarris's fame continued to grow, and he became known for his over-the-top personality and infectious enthusiasm. His \"mat talk\" style of cheering has been widely praised, and he has become a beloved figure in the world of cheerleading.\n\n**2020 arrest**\n\nIn September 2020, the FBI announced that they had obtained a warrant for Harris's arrest. The case involved allegations that Harris had solicited sex from minors. The allegations centered around two 13-year-old twin brothers who claimed that Harris had sent them suggestive messages asking for pictures and seeking sex.\n\nThe boys' mother initially dismissed the contacts, but after another cheerleading coach allegedly assaulted them, she became increasingly concerned about a pervasive atmosphere of tolerance of sexual abuse in the sport or the companies that govern it.\n\nUnited States All Star Federation, Varsity Spirit, and Cheer Athletics were later named as parties to the legal proceedings. Harris's arrest and the subsequent allegations sparked widespread outrage and concern within the cheerleading community.\n\nThe incident has led to a re-examination of the sport's culture and the ways in which it addresses issues of abuse and exploitation. Harris's case has highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency within the sport.\n\nIn the aftermath of the allegations, Harris's reputation and career have been severely impacted. The incident has served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a safe and respectful environment in all areas of life, particularly in sports and entertainment.\n\nAs the investigation and legal proceedings continue, Harris's future remains uncertain. The incident has raised important questions about the sport's culture and the need for greater accountability and transparency.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jerry_Harris_(television_personality)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nHarris was born in Hinsdale, Illinois and raised in Bolingbrook, Illinois [5] When he was 16 years old, his mother died from lung cancer [6] [7] He attended Waubonsie Valley High School [8] followed by Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, where he was a member of the cheerleader team coached by Monica Aldama [9] During the season one finale of Cheer, he received a Regional Scholars Award from the University of Louisville He attended the school for the fall semester, but ultimately returned to Navarro College [10] [11] He became famous for his eccentric personality [12]\n\n\nCareer\nIn January 2020, he appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, along with other members of the Cheer team [13] [14] [15] In February 2020, DeGeneres announced that Harris would be The Ellen DeGeneres Show's Oscars correspondent [16] [17] [18] [19] He is known for his eccentric and over-the-top \"mat talk,\" a cheerleading term, in which he yells and cheers on other people.\n\n\n2020 arrest\nIn September 2020, the FBI announced they had a warrant for Harris for allegedly soliciting sex from minors [21] The case involves twin brothers who were 13 when Harris, 19 at the time, sent suggestive messages asking for pictures and seeking sex [21] The boys' mother at first dismissed the contacts, but after another cheerleading coach allegedly assaulted them, felt there might be a pervasive atmosphere of tolerance of sexual abuse either in the sport or the companies that govern them [21] United States All Star Federation, Varsity Spirit and Cheer Athletics were later named as parties to the legal proceedings [22]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is an adaptation of the 2017 novel of the same name by Stephanie Perkins.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the fictional town of Osborne, Nebraska, where high school student Makani (Sydney Park) is struggling to cope with the death of her mother and the pressures of her new school. She befriends a group of outcasts, including her best friend Olivia (Théodore Pellerin), but their lives are disrupted by a series of murders, which seem to be connected to an anonymous killer who is targeting people who have committed violence or bullying in the past.\n\nWhen Makani's ex-boyfriend, Tyler (Ashton Sanders), is killed, she becomes the prime suspect in the investigation. However, as the killings continue, it becomes clear that the killer is targeting people who have committed similar acts of violence, and Makani's own dark past is revealed.\n\nAs the body count rises, Makani and her friends must navigate their complex relationships and confront their own demons in order to uncover the identity of the killer and bring them to justice. Along the way, they discover that the killer is using a twisted form of justice to punish those who have committed wrongs in the past.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented young cast, including Sydney Park, Théodore Pellerin, Asa Butterfield, and Andie MacDowell. The cast delivers strong performances, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Shawn Levy and James Wan under their Atomic Monster and 21 Laps companies, respectively. Henry Gayden adapted the screenplay from the novel of the same name by Stephanie Perkins. The film was shot on location in Louisiana, with a mix of practical and CGI effects used to create the film's intense and suspenseful sequences.\n\n**Release**\n\nThere's Someone Inside Your House premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 23, 2021, and was released on Netflix on October 6, 2021. The film was initially expected to be released in February 2021, but was delayed due to production issues.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its strong cast and suspenseful sequences, while others criticized its messy and misguided plot. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 47% approval rating, based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 12 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nSome critics praised the film's cast and performances, with Variety's Owen Gleiberman writing: \"The cast is game, and the performances are often impressive, particularly from Sydney Park, who gives a supercharged and sensitive performance as Makani\". However, others criticized the film's plot and pacing, with The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore writing: \"The movie's attempts to build suspense and unease are often thwarted by its messy and illogical plot\".\n\nDespite its mixed reception, There's Someone Inside Your House has been praised for its timely and thought-provoking themes, which tackle issues of violence, bullying, and social justice. The film's use of a slasher plot to explore these themes has been particularly well-received, with many critics praising the film's ability to subvert genre expectations and create a sense of unease and tension.\n\nOverall, There's Someone Inside Your House is a suspenseful and thought-provoking film that explores themes of violence, bullying, and social justice in a unique and timely way.

American psychological thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Laeta Kalogridis. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane and stars Leonardo DiCaprio as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, a veteran of World War II, who investigates the disappearance of a patient from a mental hospital on a remote island.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1954, U.S. Marshals Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on the inhospitable Shutter Island, Boston Harbor, to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient of the hospital who had previously drowned her three children. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they uncover a complex web of secrets and lies, and Teddy's own sanity begins to unravel.\n\nThe film's plot is a complex and layered exploration of themes such as trauma, grief, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. Teddy's investigation leads him to suspect that the hospital is hiding a dark secret, and he becomes increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Teddy's own past traumas are linked to the events on the island, and that his perception of reality is fragile and susceptible to manipulation.\n\nCast\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, Ben Kingsley as Dr. John Cawley, Emily Mortimer as Rachel Solando, and Max von Sydow as Dr. Sheehan. The cast delivers strong performances that bring depth and nuance to the characters and the story.\n\nProduction\n\nProduction on Shutter Island began on March 6, 2008, in Massachusetts, with filming taking place in various locations across the state. The film's cinematography is notable for its use of stark, atmospheric lighting and its emphasis on the eerie and foreboding qualities of the island setting. The score, composed by Robbie Robertson, adds to the film's sense of tension and foreboding.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe rights to Dennis Lehane's novel Shutter Island were first optioned to Columbia Pictures in 2003, but the project languished in development hell for several years before being revived by Phoenix Pictures. Laeta Kalogridis was hired to adapt the novel for the screen, and she worked closely with Martin Scorsese to develop the film. The project was a passion project for Scorsese, who was drawn to the novel's complex themes and its exploration of the human psyche.\n\nFilming\n\nShutter Island was primarily filmed in Massachusetts, with Taunton serving as the location for the World War II flashback scenes. The old industrial buildings in Taunton's Whittenton Mills Complex were used to recreate the Dachau concentration camp, while the old Medfield State Hospital in Medfield was used for the hospital scenes. The stone lodge at Borderland State Park in Easton was used for the cabin scene, and Peddocks Island was used as the setting for the island. The film's cinematography made use of the island's rugged and atmospheric setting to create a sense of tension and foreboding.\n\nMusic\n\nThe score for Shutter Island was composed by Robbie Robertson, a longtime collaborator of Martin Scorsese's. The score is a mix of traditional and Celtic instrumentation, and it adds to the film's sense of tension and foreboding. The score was well-received by critics, who praised its ability to enhance the film's atmosphere and mood.\n\nGenre\n\nShutter Island is a period piece that pays homage to the film noir and horror genres of the 1940s and 1950s. The film's plot is a complex and layered exploration of themes such as trauma, grief, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. The film's use of atmospheric lighting and its emphasis on the eerie and foreboding qualities of the island setting add to its sense of tension and foreboding.\n\nRelease\n\nShutter Island was originally scheduled to be released in October 2009, but the release date was pushed back to February 2010 due to a lack of financing for the film's marketing campaign. The film was released in the United States and Canada on February 19, 2010, and it received widespread critical acclaim.\n\nReception\n\nShutter Island received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its complex plot, atmospheric cinematography, and strong performances from the cast. The film holds a 69% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average \"C+\" grade, on an A+ to F scale.\n\nBox Office\n\nShutter Island grossed over $294 million worldwide, making it Martin Scorsese's second-highest-grossing film worldwide. The film was a commercial success, and it helped to establish Scorsese as a master of the thriller genre.\n\nHome Media\n\nShutter Island was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on June 8, 2010, and in the United Kingdom on August 2, 2010. The film was released in a special edition featuring behind-the-scenes footage and commentary from the cast and crew.\n\nOther Media\n\nIn 2014, Paramount Television and HBO were reported to be brainstorming a TV series based on Shutter Island, which would serve as an origin story for the film. The series would explore the backstory of the hospital and the events that led to the disappearance of Rachel Solando.\n\nVideo Game\n\nA video game based on Shutter Island was released for PC in 2010, and it received positive reviews from critics. The game was a stealth-based game that allowed players to control Teddy Daniels as he investigated the disappearance of Rachel Solando.\n\nNotes\n\nShutter Island is a complex and layered film that explores themes of trauma, grief, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. The film's use of atmospheric lighting and its emphasis on the eerie and foreboding qualities of the island setting add to its sense of tension and foreboding.

is a social networking service that has become a platform for people to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences with the world. Founded in 2006, Twitter has grown into a global phenomenon, with over 440 million monthly active users. In this article, we will delve into the history, growth, and evolution of Twitter, as well as its various services, leadership, finances, and funding.\n\n# History\n\n## 2006–2007: Creation and Initial Reaction\n\nTwitter's origins lie in a \"daylong brainstorming session\" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. Work on the project started in February 2006. Dorsey published the first Twitter message on March 21, 2006, at 12:50 p.m PST (UTC−08:00): \"just setting up my twttr\". The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees. The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders. Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011. Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.\n\n## 2007–2022: Growth\n\nIn April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies. Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin. Twitter hit 100 million monthly active users in September 2011. On December 18, 2012, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users.\n\n## 2022 and 2023\n\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk revealed that he had bought 9.1% of Twitter for $2.64 billion on April 4, 2022. In response, Twitter's stock rose by as much as 27% and Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday surge since Twitter's IPO in 2013. Musk was appointed to Twitter's board on April 9, under a deal that prohibited him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.\n\n## Acquisition by Elon Musk\n\nBusiness magnate Elon Musk revealed that he had bought 9.1% of Twitter for $2.64 billion on April 4, 2022.

Musk was appointed to Twitter's board on April 9, under a deal that prohibited him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.\n\n## Post-acquisition\n\nOn October 28, immediately following Musk's acquisition, he fired CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal. Twitter's stock was suspended from trading prior to the New York Stock Exchange opening the next day and was delisted on November 8. On October 31, Musk announced in a security filing that he had dissolved the board of directors and would serve as the CEO of the company. In January 2023, he also fired an employee who criticized him.\n\n# Services\n\n## Twitter\n\nTwitter was an American social networking service that was rebranded as X in 2023.

purposes [161] [162] Colliers Park continues to be improved; a running hill, as well as all-weather pitches and a small stand have been constructed since the facilities opened in 1997 Colliers Park

A.F.C.\n\nWrexham Association Football Club, commonly referred to as Wrexham A.F.C. or Wrexham, is a professional football club based in Wrexham, Wales. The club was formed in 1864 and is one of the oldest football clubs in the world, with a rich history and a passionate fan base.\n\n**History**\n\nThe club was formed in October 1864 by members of the Wrexham Cricket Club who wanted a sporting activity for the winter months. This makes them (after Sheffield, Cray, Hallam, and Notts County) the fifth oldest association football team, the third oldest professional club and the oldest in Wales. Their first game was played on 22 October 1864 at the Denbighshire County Cricket Ground (The Racecourse) against the Prince of Wales Fire Brigade.\n\n**1864–1905: A club of pioneers**\n\nThe club remained in the Combination League until 1905, by which time they had managed to win the league four times. After several unsuccessful attempts, Wrexham was finally elected to the Birmingham and District League in time for the beginning of the 1905–06 season. Wrexham's first-ever match in this league was at home against Kidderminster Harriers at the Racecourse, and two thousand spectators witnessed Wrexham win the match 2–1. Wrexham finished sixth in their first season in this league. During their time in the Birmingham and District League, Wrexham won the Welsh Cup six times, in 1908–09, 1909–10, 1910–11, 1913–14, 1914–15, and 1920–21. They also reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup for a second time in the 1908–09 season before losing a replay 1–2 to Exeter City after extra time.\n\n**1905–1968: Into the Football League**\n\nThe club remained in the Birmingham and District League until 1923, when they were elected to the Football League Third Division. During their time in the Football League, Wrexham experienced periods of success and failure, but never managed to win a major trophy. However, they did reach the final of the Welsh Cup in 1933, where they lost to Bangor City.\n\n**1968–1982: The glory years**\n\nJohn Neal was appointed manager of Wrexham in 1968, succeeding Alvan Williams who had brought Neal to the club as his assistant. He guided the club to a 9th place finish in 1969, before leading Wrexham to their second Football League promotion in 1970 with a second place finish and promotion to the Third Division. With Welsh clubs now able to qualify for the European Cup Winners' Cup by winning the Welsh Cup, Wrexham played their inaugural match in Europe against Swiss side FC Zurich in Switzerland on 13 September 1972, the game finishing 1–1. The return leg saw Wrexham win 2–1, advancing to the second round with a 3–2 win on aggregate.\n\n**1982–1991: Decline**\n\nThe summer of 1982 saw Bobby Roberts appointed the club's new manager. Relegation meant the club had dire financial problems, resulting in the sale of many of the club's experienced and talented players. Frank Carrodus, Ian Edwards, Mick Vinter and Wayne Cegieski had already left during the summer, Steve Fox, Joey Jones, Dixie McNeil and Billy Ronson soon followed. Wrexham were again relegated to the Fourth Division after plummeting from apparent mid-table security. The club's slide continued into the following season, and only goal difference prevented Wrexham from being forced to apply for re-election to the League.\n\n**1991–2001: Giant killers**\n\nThe 1991–92 season saw Wrexham still in a poor financial state, as they continued to struggle on the field. With the club knocked out of the League Cup and struggling in the league, it was left to the FA Cup to keep the season alive. Having beaten Telford United and Winsford United, they were drawn to play the previous season's First Division champions Arsenal. Wrexham produced one of their most memorable nights to beat the Gunners 2–1 after being behind, with a thunderous Mickey Thomas free kick and a Steve Watkin goal. They lost in the next round to West Ham United 1–0 in a replay after the first game had finished 2–2.\n\n**2001–2008: Administration and the slide into non-League football**\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, the club was dogged with many problems off the pitch, including then chairman Alex Hamilton, attempting to get the club evicted from the stadium so that he could use and sell it for his own development purposes. The saga involved the sale of the Racecourse Ground to a separate company owned by Hamilton immediately after he became the club's chairman. The club was included in FIFA Football 2004 for the first time and remained playable up to FIFA 08.\n\n**2008–2020: The non-League years**\n\nThe 2008–09 season started well, with a 5–0 home victory against Stevenage Borough. However, a run of poor results followed, with Wrexham being left in the mid-table battle, only four points above the relegation zone and only keeping two clean sheets all season. Following a 3–0 home defeat against Rushden and Diamonds, and fans calling for his dismissal, Little left Wrexham by mutual consent. Little was replaced by Dean Saunders. Wrexham's first full season in the Conference Premier ended in a disappointing 10th place. The following year, 2009–10, ended in a similar fashion with Wrexham finishing in 11th position, well off the pace of the promotion battle.\n\n**2020–present: New owners, return to EFL**\n\nIn November 2020, Canadian-American actor Ryan Reynolds and American actor Rob McElhenney, through their RR McReynolds Company LLC, bought the club. The deal received the backing of 98.6% of the 2,000 members of the Wrexham Supporters Trust that voted and was completed in February 2021. They were included in FIFA 22 as part of the \"Rest of World\" section, becoming the first non-league team to be featured in the series. In 2021–22, Wrexham finished 2nd before losing the play-off semi-final 5–4 to Grimsby Town after extra time. Wrexham also reached the 2022 FA Trophy final which they lost 1–0 to Bromley.\n\n**Sponsorship**\n\nWrexham's home kit is red shirts, white shorts, and white socks. The club has played in a predominantly red kit with white features since the late 1930s. The away kit is white shirts, red shorts, and red socks. In 2014–15, to celebrate the club's 150th anniversary, Wrexham wore a red and black hooped Nike home shirt as this was the club's first ever recorded home shirt. Macron have been the kit supplier of Wrexham AFC since 2016 and helped arrange a pre-season training camp for the first team in pre-season 2017 in Portugal where over 600 supporters traveled over to support the team in a 2–1 win over Louletano. They still visit Portugal each summer.\n\n**Kit manufacturers and sponsors**\n\nSince 1864, Wrexham have played their home games at The Racecourse Ground, situated on the Mold Road, which is the main through road heading into Wrexham; it is opposite the residential area of Maesgwyn, situated between Wrexham University and Wrexham General railway station. In August 2011 Wrexham University purchased the stadium and the club training facilities in Gresford, adding their name to the stadium for it to become The Glyndŵr University Racecourse Stadium (Glyndŵr University was the name of Wrexham University at the time). Subsequently, in 2016, Wrexham Supporters Trust secured a 99-year lease on the ground, and the name reverted to the Racecourse Ground. The capacity is 10,500, which made it one of the largest stadiums in the National League. In June 2022, Wrexham AFC purchased the Racecourse Ground freehold from the university and are planning renovations to the stadium. The maximum capacity as of the 2024/25 season is 13,341 due to an expanded temporary Kop.\n\n**Support**\n\nIn August 2011, Wrexham were faced with being expelled from the Football Conference. Fans rallied and raised £127,000 in one day to help pay a bond, so they could secure football for the forthcoming season. A month later the Wrexham Supporters' Trust (WST) took over the day-to-day running of the club. Fan ownership of Wrexham was finally ratified on 12 December 2011. As of May 2015 the WST had 4,129 adult members and joint-owners of the club. As well as the city of Wrexham, support is drawn from the surrounding towns and villages of the district, such as Gwersyllt and Rhos, the Flintshire towns of Mold, Buckley, Holywell, and Deeside. For the 2013 FA Trophy final coaches of Wrexham fans came from many North Wales towns including; Bala, Bangor, Caernarfon, Colwyn Bay, Denbigh, Flint, Llandudno, Prestatyn, Rhyl, and Ruthin. Additionally, many Wrexham fans reside in Shropshire.\n\n**Rivalries**\n\nWrexham has a fierce rivalry with Chester; the two contest the cross-border derby.

When the construction had been completed it was officially opened in June 1997, at a building cost of £750,000 [160] It is widely regarded in British football as one of the best training grounds outside the top flight and one of the best never to have been used by a top-flight team [161] The England national team, Barcelona, Rangers and the Wales national team have all used it for training purposes [161] [162] Colliers Park continues to be improved; a running hill, as well as all-weather pitches and a small stand have been constructed since the facilities opened in 1997 Colliers Park was bought by Glyndwr University as part of their purchase of the Racecourse Ground assets in 2011 [163] Wrexham's former training ground found a new purpose after about £4 million were invested by the Football Association of Wales to transform it into a National Development Centre in February 2018 [164]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules

game was against France, drawing 0–0 However, the game spread notoriety for several Swiss players' jerseys being ripped during challenges with the French players, and also for the ball bursting during a challenge between Antoine Griezmann and Valon Behrami when they both converged on the ball, with the game also attracting attention for its poor surface, which was criticised by both coaches and players of the two teams; after the game, Switzerland's kit manufacturer had blamed \"faulty material\" for the incidents regarding the jerseys being ripped [78] [79] [80] Switzerland, due to the

Swiss had not qualified for any major tournament since 1966 [22] Under his guidance, Switzerland rose to 3rd in the FIFA World Ranking in August 1993, which still remains their highest FIFA ranking to this day [23] Hodgson led Switzerland to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, losing just one game during qualifying, in a group that included Italy, Portugal, and Scotland [24] The Swiss won their home tie with Italy, and in the away game, took a 2–0 lead before being pegged back to a 2–2 draw, and also took four points from Scotland, winning 3–1 at home and drawing 1–1 away [25] [26] [27] Against the Portuguese, Switzerland drew 1–1 at home and lost 1–0 in the away fixture in Porto, their only defeat of the qualifying campaign [28] [29] Their opening match against hosts United States, on 18 June 1994, was played indoors at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, and the two teams drew 1–1 in the opening match of the World Cup [30] In the next match, they won 4–1 over Romania, and in their final game against Colombia, the Swiss lost 2–0 [31] [32] Nevertheless, Switzerland still qualified from the group, but were knocked out by Spain, losing 3–0 [33]\n\n\n2000–2008: the Köbi Kuhn era\nAt UEFA Euro 1996, Switzerland once again easily qualified for the tournament hosted in England, as they topped their qualifying group, losing just once, which was a 1–2 defeat to Turkey [34] [35] They were drawn in Group A, but their tournament was disappointing overall; as they finished bottom of the group [36] Their opening match was against hosts England, and the two sides drew 1–1 [37] In their second match, they lost 2–0 to the Netherlands, and in their final group game, lost 1–0 to Scotland [38] [39] Switzerland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, hosted in France, as they finished fourth in their qualifying group, winning three games; 3–2 against Finland, 1–0 against Hungary and 5–0 against Azerbaijan, drawing one game against Hungary (1–1), and losing three games; 1–0 against Azerbaijan and losing both games against Norway, losing 1–0 at home and 5–0 away [40]\n\n\n2008–2014: the Ottmar Hitzfeld era\nIn their first match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team defeated eventual champions Spain 1–0 with a goal by Gelson Fernandes, but they were still eliminated in the group stage [55] In the second match, a goal scored by Mark González in the 75th minute of the game against Chile ended a 559-minute streak without conceding a goal in World Cup matches, beating the record previously held by Italy by nine minutes [56] [57] [58] Switzerland did not advance

the tournament; alongside hosts France, Albania and Romania [75] In the first game, Switzerland won 1–0 over Albania, with the only goal being scored by Fabian Schär in the fifth minute of the game [76] The next match was a 1–1 draw with Romania, with Switzerland initially conceding from a penalty but equalizing in the second half following a goal from Admir Mehmedi [77] The final group game was against France, drawing 0–0 However, the game spread notoriety for several Swiss players' jerseys being ripped during challenges with the French players, and also for the ball bursting during a challenge between Antoine Griezmann and Valon Behrami when they both converged on the ball, with the game also attracting attention for its poor surface, which was criticised by both coaches and players of the two teams; after the game, Switzerland's kit manufacturer had blamed \"faulty material\" for the incidents regarding the jerseys being ripped [78] [79] [80] Switzerland, due to the draw, finished second in the group to set up a tie against Poland in the round of sixteen; initially the Swiss conceded but managed to find a late equalizer from Xherdan Shaqiri, who scored a bicycle-kick to send the game into extra-time, but the Swiss were knocked out as Granit Xhaka had missed the second penalty during the penalty shootout, as all other players managed to convert their penalties, with Poland winning 5–4 on penalties to go through and knock out the Swiss [81] [82] [83]\nIn qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Switzerland were drawn with Portugal, Hungary, Faroe Islands, Latvia and Andorra [84] The Swiss began their qualifying group with a shock 2–0 win over European champions Portugal, who had won the tournament less than two months prior to playing with them on 6 September [85] Afterwards, they beat Hungary 2–3, Andorra 2–1, Faroe Islands 2–0, Latvia 1–0 in the first five games, leading the group on maximum points [86] [87] [88] [89] In the reverse fixtures, they beat Faroe Islands 2–0, Andorra 3–0, Latvia 3–0 and Hungary 5–2, [90] [91] [92] [93] before facing Portugal in the final group game, where they lost 2–0, [94] meaning they would have to play in the play-offs; where they were ranked as the best second-placed team, [84] [95] and were drawn to play Northern Ireland In the first leg, played on 9 November, they won 1–0 through a controversial penalty scored by Ricardo Rodríguez, and three days later played in the second leg, drawing 0–0 and advancing to the World Cup finals in Russia with a 1–0 aggregate win [96] [97] [98] Before the World Cup, Switzerland were ranked 6th in the world ranking, even ranking higher than eventual World Cup winners France [99]\n\n\n2021–present: the Murat Yakin era\nOn 9 August 2021, Yakin became the manager of the Swiss national team [115] During the 2022 World Cup qualification, Switzerland finished in the first place ahead of Italy in Group C, which granted them a spot in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar [116] During the World Cup, Switzerland finished second in Group G to qualify the round of 16, where they lost 6–1 to Portugal [117] In 2023, Switzerland played against

{"title": "Haifa", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest Caiaphas [citation needed] Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keipha [citation needed] Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), from H-f-h root (ח-פ-ה), meaning to cover or shield, i.e Mount Carmel covers Haifa; [9] others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning \"shore\", or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning \"beautiful shore\" [9] [10]\n\n\nLocations and names\nThe earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was the city Sycaminum [12] The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal tell, or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as Tel Shikmona, [13] meaning 'mound of the Ficus sycomorus', and in Arabic as Tell el-Semak or Tell es-Samak, meaning 'mound of the sumak trees', names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the Mishnah (composed c 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it [13] [14]\n\n\nSycaminum and Efa\nThe earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was the city Sycaminum [12] The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal tell, or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as Tel Shikmona, [13] meaning 'mound of the Ficus sycomorus', and in Arabic as Tell el-Semak or Tell es-Samak, meaning 'mound of the sumak trees', names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the Mishnah (composed c 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it [13] [14]\n\n\nPorphyreon\nAround the 6th century, Porphyreon or Porphyrea is mentioned in the writings of William of Tyre, [dubious – discuss] and while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon [5] [13]\n\n\nEarly Muslim Haifa\nFollowing the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Haifa was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona) [13] Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi [17] Nasir-i-Khusrau visited in 1047; he noted that \"Haifa lies on the seashore, and there are here palm-gardens and trees in numbers There are in this town shipbuilders, who build very large craft.\" [18]\n\n\nCrusader Caiphas\nThe Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, called it Caiphas, [12] and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter [14] Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as Caiaphas civitas, [19] and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus [14]\n\n\nLate Ottoman \"Old Haifa\"\nHaifa al-'Atiqa (Arabic: 'Ancient Haifa') is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of a hamlet of 250 residents, before the settlement was moved in 1764–5 to the site from which the modern city emerged [20]\n\n\nHaifa al-Jadida (New Haifa) and modern Haifa\nIn 1764–5 Zahir al-Umar moved the village to a new site 1.5 mi (2.4 km) to the east, which he also fortified [20] The new village, the nucleus of modern Haifa, was first called al-imara al-jadida (Arabic: 'the new construction') by some, but others residing there called it Haifa al-Jadida ('New Haifa') at first, and then simply Haifa [2]\n\n\nHistory\nA town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE) [5] It was a port and fishing village.\n\n\nBronze Age: Tell Abu Hawam\nA town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE) [5] It was a port and fishing village.\n\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible\nMount Carmel and the Kishon River are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible [22] [23]\n\n\nPersian and Hellenistic period: near Shikmona\nIn the 6th century BCE, during the Persian period, Greek geographer Scylax wrote of a city \"between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus\" (i.e., the Carmel), which may be a reference to Shikmona, a locality in the Haifa area [5]\n\n\nShikmona\nHaifa was located near the town of Shikmona, a center for making the traditional Tekhelet dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple The archaeological site of Shikmona is southwest of Bat Galim [27]\n\n\nRoman period\nIn about the 3rd century CE, Haifa was first mentioned in Talmudic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi Avdimi and other Jewish scholars According to the Talmud, fishermen caught Murex, sea snails which yielded purple dye used to make tallit (Jewish prayer shawls) from Haifa to the Ladder of the Tyrians Tombs dating from the Roman era, including Jewish burial caves, have been found in the area [5] [29] [30]\n\n\nByzantine period\nUnder Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance [31] A kinah speaks of the destruction of the Jewish community of Haifa along with other communities when the Byzantines reconquered the country from the Sasanian Empire in 628 during the Byzantine-Sasanian War [30]\n\n\nEarly Muslim period\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s–40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of 'Akka [2] Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop [32]\n\n\nCrusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule\nProsperity ended in 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and blockaded by European Christians shortly after the end of the First Crusade, and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison Jews comprised the majority of the city's population at the time [30] [33] [34] Under the Crusaders, Haifa was reduced to a small fortified coastal stronghold [33] It was a part of the Principality of Galilee within the Kingdom of Jerusalem Following their victory at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin's Ayyubid army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city's Crusader fortress was destroyed [5] [35] The Crusaders under Richard the Lionheart retook Haifa in 1191 [36]\n\n\nOttoman period\nHaifa was apparently uninhabited at the time the Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine in 1516 The first indication of its resettlement was given in a description by German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf, who visited Palestine in 1575 [30] In 1596, Haifa appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Sahil Atlit of the Liwa of Lajjun It had a population of 32 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives [40] Haifa was subsequently mentioned in the accounts of travelers as a half-ruined impoverished village with few inhabitants The expansion of commercial trade between Europe and Palestine in the 17th century saw Haifa's revival as a flourishing port as more ships began docking there rather than Acre [29]\n\n\nBaháʼí faith's shrine\nIn 1909, Haifa became important to the Baháʼí Faith when the remains of the Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of Baháʼu'lláh in the Baháʼí Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel Baháʼís consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh in Acre Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Baháʼu'lláh himself to his eldest son, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, in 1891 ʻAbdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi In a separate room, the remains of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá were buried in November 1921 [54]\n\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army armed with spears and swords who overran Ottoman positions [55] On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received indicating that the Turks were leaving Haifa The British made preparations to enter the city and came under fire in the Balad al-Sheikh district (today Nesher) After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel [55]\n\n\n1947–1948 Civil War in Palestine\nThe 1947 UN Partition Plan in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed Jewish state Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December [72] The Arab city was in a state of chaos The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: \"Keep away the cowards who wish to flee Expell them from your lines Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy\" Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood [73]\n\n\nState of Israel\nAfter the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar HaCarmel date from this period In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout [84] In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them [85] Their demand for \"bread and work\" was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut [86]\n\n\nDemographics\nHaifa is Israel's third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households, [93] or a population of 290,306 Immigrants from the former Soviet Union constitute 25% of Haifa's population, [94] thus making Russian one of the three main spoken languages of the city.\n\n\nReligious and ethnic communities\nThe population is heterogeneous Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the majority of whom are Arab Christians) [99] and, some 4% are Muslims Haifa also includes Druze and Baháʼí Faith communities In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups The trend continues in the age 15–29 group, in which 27% of the Arab population is found, and the age 30–44 group (23%) The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population [91] Arabs in Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel [101]\n\n\nGeography\nHaifa is situated on the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain, the historic land bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the mouth of the Kishon River [108] Located on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel and around Haifa Bay, the city is split over three tiers [109] The lowest is the center of commerce and industry including the Port of Haifa [109] The middle level is on the slopes of Mount Carmel and consists of older residential neighborhoods, while the upper level consists of modern neighborhoods looking over the lower tiers [109] From here views can be had across the Western Galilee region of Israel towards Rosh HaNikra and the Lebanese border [109] Haifa is about 90 km (55.9 mi) north of the city of Tel Aviv, and has a large number of beaches on the Mediterranean [110]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe Carmel Mountain has three main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si'ach For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons [citation needed]\n\n\nClimate\nHaifa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters (Köppen climate classification Csa) [113] Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days The average temperature in summer is 26 °C (79 °F) and in winter, 12 °C (54 °F) Frost is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F) can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning Snow is very rare, which last

in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for Government Buildings Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife [109]\n\n\nUrban development\nRecently,

Neve Sha'anan (54,000 sq m) [119] In 2004, 80% of construction in the city was private [119]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe common Israeli saying, \"Haifa works, Jerusalem prays, and Tel Aviv plays\" attests to Haifa's reputation as a city of workers and industry [130] The industrial region of Haifa is in the eastern part of the city, around the Kishon River It is home to the Haifa oil refinery, one of the two oil refineries in Israel (the other refinery being located in Ashdod) The Haifa refinery processes 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of crude oil a year [131] Its nowadays unused twin 80-meter

A kinah speaks of the destruction of the Jewish community of Haifa along with other communities when the Byzantines reconquered the country from the Sasanian Empire in 628 during the Byzantine-Sasanian War.\n\n# Early Muslim period\n\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s–40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of 'Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop.\n\n# Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule\n\nProsperity ended in 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and blockaded by European Christians shortly after the end of the First Crusade, and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison. Jews comprised the majority of the city's population at the time. Under the Crusaders, Haifa was reduced to a small fortified coastal stronghold. It was a part of the Principality of Galilee within the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Following their victory at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin's Ayyubid army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city's Crusader fortress was destroyed. The Crusaders under Richard the Lionheart retook Haifa in 1191.\n\n# Ottoman period\n\nHaifa was apparently uninhabited at the time the Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine in 1516. The first indication of its resettlement was given in a description by German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf, who visited Palestine in 1575. In 1596, Haifa appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Sahil Atlit of the Liwa of Lajjun. It had a population of 32 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives.\n\n# Baháʼí faith's shrine\n\nIn 1909, Haifa became important to the Baháʼí Faith when the remains of the Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of Baháʼu'lláh in the Baháʼí Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Baháʼís consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Baháʼu'lláh himself to his eldest son, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, in 1891. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá were buried in November 1921.\n\n# British Mandate\n\nHaifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army armed with spears and swords who overran Ottoman positions. On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received indicating that the Turks were leaving Haifa. The British made preparations to enter the city and came under fire in the Balad al-Sheikh district (today Nesher). After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel.\n\n# 1947–1948 Civil War in Palestine\n\nThe 1947 UN Partition Plan in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed Jewish state. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December. The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: \"Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy.\" Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.\n\n# State of Israel\n\nAfter the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnai Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar HaCarmel date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them. Their demand for \"bread and work\" was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut.\n\n# Demographics\n\nHaifa is Israel's third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households, or a population of 290,306. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union constitute 25% of Haifa's population, thus making Russian one of the three main spoken languages of the city.\n\n# Religious and ethnic communities\n\nThe population is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the majority of whom are Arab Christians), and some 4% are Muslims. Haifa also includes Druze and Baháʼí Faith communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15–29 group, in which 27% of the Arab population is found, and the age 30–44 group (23%). Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population. Arabs in Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compared to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel.\n\n# Geography\n\nHaifa is situated on the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain, the historic land bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the mouth of the Kishon River. Located on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel and around Haifa Bay, the city is split over three tiers. The lowest is the center of commerce and industry, including the Port of Haifa. The middle level is on the slopes of Mount Carmel and consists of older residential neighborhoods, while the upper level consists of modern neighborhoods looking over the lower tiers. From here, views can be had across the Western Galilee region of Israel towards Rosh HaNikra and the Lebanese border. Haifa is about 90 kilometers north of the city of Tel Aviv, and has a large number of beaches on the Mediterranean.\n\n# Flora and fauna\n\nThe Carmel Mountain has three main wadis: Lotem, Amik, and Si'ach. For the most part, these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls, and chameleons.\n\n# Climate\n\nHaifa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters (Köppen climate classification Csa). Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase. By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. The average temperature in summer is 26°C (79°F), and in winter, 12°C (54°F). Frost is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around 3°C (37°F) can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning. Snow is very rare, which last fell in 1950. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between September and May. Annual precipitation is approximately 629 millimeters (25 inches).\n\n# Neighborhoods\n\nHaifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for Government Buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.\n\n# Urban development\n\nRecently, residential construction has been concentrated around Kiryat Haim and Kiryat Shmuel, with 75,000 square meters of new residential construction between 2002 and 2004, the Carmel (70,000 square meters), and Ramot Neve Sha'anan (approximately 70,000 square meters). Non-residential construction was highest in the Lower Town (90,000 square meters), Haifa Bay (72,000 square meters), and Ramot Neve Sha'anan (54,000 square meters). In 2004, 80% of construction in the city was private.\n\n# Economy\n\nThe common Israeli saying, \"Haifa works, Jerusalem prays, and Tel Aviv plays,\" attests to Haifa's reputation as a city of workers and industry. The industrial region of Haifa is in the eastern part of the city, around the Kishon River. It is home to the Haifa oil refinery, one of the two oil refineries in Israel (the other refinery being located in Ashdod). The Haifa refinery processes 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of crude oil a year. Its twin 80-meter high cooling towers, built in the 1930s, were the tallest buildings built in the British Mandate period. Matam, the largest and oldest business park in Israel, is at the southern entrance to the city, hosting manufacturing and R&D facilities for a large number of Israeli and international hi-tech companies.\n\n# Tourism\n\nIn 2005, Haifa had 13 hotels with a total of 1,462 rooms. The city has a 17-kilometer shoreline, of which 5 kilometers are beaches. Haifa's main tourist attraction is the Bahá'í World Centre, with the golden-domed Shrine of the Báb and the surrounding gardens. Between 2005 and 2006, 86,037 visitors visited the shrine. In 2008, the Bahá'í gardens were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The restored German Colony, founded by the Templers, Stella Maris, and Elijah's Cave also draw many tourists. Located in the Haifa district are the Ein Hod artists' colony, where over 90 artists and craftsmen have studios and exhibitions, and the Mount Carmel national park, with caves where Neanderthal and early Homo Sapiens remains were found.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nDespite its image as a port and industrial city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel. During the 1950s, mayor Abba Hushi made a special effort to encourage authors and poets to move to the city, and founded the Haifa Theatre, a repertory theatre, the first municipal theatre founded in the country. The principal Arabic theatre servicing the northern Arab population is the al-Midan Theatre. Other theatres in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts, and special events.\n\n# Museums\n\nHaifa has over a dozen museums. The most popular museum is the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, which recorded almost 150,000 visitors in 2004. The Haifa Museum of Art houses a collection of modern and classical art, as well as displays on the history of Haifa. The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is the only museum in the Middle East dedicated solely to Japanese art. Other museums in Haifa include the Museum of Prehistory, the National Maritime Museum, and Haifa City Museum, the Hecht Museum, the Dagon Archaeological Museum of Grain Handling, the Railway Museum, the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, the Israeli Oil Industry Museum, and Chagall Artists' House. As part of his campaign to bring culture to Haifa, Mayor Abba Hushi provided the artist Mane-Katz with a building on Mount Carmel to house his collection of Judaica, which is now a museum. The former home and studio of artist Hermann Struck is now the Hermann Struck Museum. The Haifa Educational Zoo at Gan HaEm park houses a small animal collection including Syrian brown bears, now extinct from Israel. Within the zoo is the Pinhas House biology institute. In the close vicinity of Haifa, on the Carmel, the Northern \"H", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Haifa\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest Caiaphas [citation needed] Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keipha [citation needed] Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), from H-f-h root (ח-פ-ה), meaning to cover or shield, i.e Mount Carmel covers Haifa; [9] others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning \"shore\", or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning \"beautiful shore\" [9] [10]\n\n\nLocations and names\nThe earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was the city Sycaminum [12] The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal tell, or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as Tel Shikmona, [13] meaning 'mound of the Ficus sycomorus', and in Arabic as Tell el-Semak or Tell es-Samak, meaning 'mound of the sumak trees', names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the Mishnah (composed c 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it [13] [14]\n\n\nSycaminum and Efa\nThe earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa

while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon [5] [13]\n\n\nEarly Muslim Haifa\nFollowing the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Haifa was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona) [13] Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi [17] Nasir-i-Khusrau visited in 1047; he noted that \"Haifa lies on the seashore, and there are here palm-gardens and trees in numbers There are in this town shipbuilders, who build very large craft.\" [18]\n\n\nCrusader Caiphas\nThe Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, called it Caiphas, [12] and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter [14] Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as Caiaphas civitas, [19] and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus [14]\n\n\nLate Ottoman \"Old Haifa\"\nHaifa al-'Atiqa (Arabic: 'Ancient Haifa') is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of a hamlet of 250 residents, before the settlement was moved in 1764–5 to the site from which the modern city emerged [20]\n\n\nHaifa al-Jadida (New Haifa) and modern Haifa\nIn 1764–5 Zahir al-Umar moved the village to a new site 1.5 mi (2.4 km) to the east, which he also fortified [20] The new village, the nucleus of modern Haifa, was first called al-imara al-jadida (Arabic: 'the new construction') by some, but others residing there called it Haifa al-Jadida ('New Haifa') at first, and then simply Haifa [2]\n\n\nHistory\nA town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE) [5] It was a port and fishing

She was born on 21 August 1930, at Glamis Castle in Scotland, and was affectionately known as Margot within the royal family.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMargaret was the first member of the royal family in direct line of succession to be born in Scotland since the 1600s. She was delivered by Sir Henry Simson, the royal obstetrician, and was registered with a delay of several days to avoid being numbered 13 in the parish register. Margaret was baptised in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30 October 1930, by Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n**Post-War Years**\n\nAt the end of the war in 1945, Margaret appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill. She and her sister Elizabeth joined the crowds outside the palace, incognito, chanting \"We want the King, we want the Queen!\" They joined in on the festivities with their fellow British citizens, playing the \"hokey cokey\", \"Lambeth Walk\", and conga. Margaret and Elizabeth were \"terrified\" of being recognised, so they did their best to stay hidden in plain sight.\n\n**The Margaret Set**\n\nAround the time of Elizabeth's wedding, the press started to follow the social life of \"unconventional\" Margaret and her reputation for vivacity and wit. A young woman with \"vivid blue eyes\", Margaret enjoyed socialising with high society and young aristocrats, including Sharman Douglas, the daughter of the American ambassador, Lewis Williams Douglas. A celebrated beauty known for her glamour and fashion sense, Margaret was often featured in the press at balls, parties, and nightclubs with friends who became known as the \"Margaret Set\". The number of her official engagements increased, and she joined a growing number of charitable organisations as president or patron.\n\n**'Romances' and the Press (1947-1959)**\n\nThe press avidly discussed \"the world's most eligible bachelor-girl\" and her alleged romances with more than 30 bachelors, including David Mountbatten, Michael I of Romania, Dominic Elliot, Colin Tennant, Prince Henry of Hesse-Kassel, and future Canadian prime minister John Turner. Most had titles and almost all were wealthy. Lord Blandford and Lord Dalkeith, both wealthy sons of dukes, were the likeliest potential husbands. Her family reportedly hoped that Margaret would marry Dalkeith, but, unlike him, Margaret was uninterested in the outdoors. Billy Wallace, sole heir to a £2.8 million fortune and an old friend, was reportedly Margaret's favourite date during the mid-1950s.\n\n**Romance with Peter Townsend**\n\nDuring the war, the King suggested choosing palace aides who were highly qualified men from the military, instead of only aristocrats. Told that a handsome war hero had arrived, the princesses met Townsend, the new equerry, on his first day at Buckingham Palace in 1944. Elizabeth reportedly told her sister, 13 years old, \"Bad luck, he's married\". A temporary assignment of three months from the RAF became permanent. The King and Queen were fond of Townsend; the King reportedly saw the calm and efficient combat veteran as the son he never had. He may have been aware of Margaret's infatuation with the non-titled and non-wealthy Townsend, reportedly seeing the courtier reluctantly obey the princess's order to carry her up palace stairs after a party.\n\n**Marriage Proposal**\n\nPrivate Secretary to the Queen Sir Alan Lascelles wrote that Townsend told Lascelles he had asked Margaret to marry him shortly before Christmas 1952. Other sources claim it occurred in February or April 1953. He was 15 years her senior and had two children from his previous marriage. Margaret accepted and informed her sister, the Queen, whose consent was required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772. During the abdication crisis, the Church of England had refused to countenance the remarriage of the divorced Queen Mary had recently died, and, after the coronation of Elizabeth II, the new queen planned to tour the Commonwealth for six months. She told her sister, \"Under the circumstances, it isn't unreasonable for me to ask you to wait a year\", and to keep the relationship secret until after the coronation.\n\n**End of Relationship**\n\nOn 31 October 1955, Margaret issued a statement, effectively ending her engagement to Townsend.\n\n**Marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones**\n\nMargaret accepted one of Wallace's many proposals to marry in 1956, but the engagement ended before an official announcement when he admitted to a romance in the Bahamas; \"I had my chance and blew it with my big mouth\", Wallace said. Margaret did not reveal this publicly until an interview and subsequent biography with Nigel Dempster in 1977.\n\n**Separation and Divorce**\n\nBoth parties in the marriage regularly engaged in extramarital relationships. Lord Snowdon had a series of affairs, including with long-term mistress, Ann Hills, and Lady Jacqueline Rufus-Isaacs, daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Reading. Anne De Courcy's 2008 biography summarises the situation with a quote from a close friend: \"If it moves, he'll have it.\"\n\n**Public Life**\n\nAmong Margaret's first official engagements was launching the ocean liner Edinburgh Castle in Belfast in 1947. Subsequently, Margaret went on multiple tours of various places; in her first major tour she joined her parents and sister for a tour of South Africa in 1947. Her tour aboard Britannia to the British colonies in the Caribbean in 1955 created a sensation throughout the West Indies, and calypsos were dedicated to her. As colonies of the British Commonwealth of Nations sought nationhood, Margaret represented the Crown at independence ceremonies in Jamaica in 1962 and Tuvalu and Dominica in 1978.\n\n**Charity Work**\n\nMargaret's main interests were welfare charities, music, and ballet. She was president of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), the Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (Children 1st), and Invalid Children's Aid Nationwide (also called 'I CAN'). She was also Grand President of the St John Ambulance Brigade. Margaret was president or patron of numerous organisations, such as the West Indies Olympic Association, the Girl Guides, Northern Ballet Theatre, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Scottish Ballet, Tenovus Cancer Care, the Royal College of Nursing, and the London Lighthouse (an AIDS charity that has since merged with the Terrence Higgins Trust).\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nMargaret's later life was marred by illness and disability. She began smoking cigarettes in her late teens and had continued to smoke heavily for many years thereafter. In the 1970s, she suffered a nervous breakdown and was treated for depression by a psychiatrist from the Priory Clinic. Later on, she suffered from migraines, laryngitis, and bronchitis. In January 1980, she was operated on at the London Clinic to remove a benign skin lesion. On 5 January 1985, she had part of her left lung removed; the operation drew parallels with that of her father 34 years earlier.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMargaret's legacy extends beyond her royal connections. As a fashion icon, she was known for her sense of style, which was both glamorous and accessible. She was a patron of the arts, supporting numerous charities and organisations throughout her life. Her public life was marked by her enthusiasm and dedication to her causes, as well as her humanity and vulnerability.\n\n**Fashion and Style**\n\nDuring her lifetime, Margaret was considered a fashion icon. Her fashion earned the nickname 'The Margaret Look'. The princess, dubbed a 'royal rebel', styled herself in contrast to her sister's prim and timeless style, adopting trendy mod accessories, such as brightly coloured headscarves and glamorous sunglasses. Margaret developed a close relationship with atelier Christian Dior, wearing his designs throughout her life and becoming one of his most prominent customers.\n\n**Finances**\n\nIn her lifetime, Margaret's fortune was estimated to be around £20 million, with most of it being inherited from her father. She also inherited pieces of art and antiques from Queen Mary, and Dame Margaret Greville left her £20,000 in 1943. In 1999, her son, Lord Linley, sold her Caribbean residence Les Jolies Eaux for a reported £2.4 million. At the time of her death Margaret received £219,000 from the civil list. Following her death, she left a £7.6 million estate to her two children, which was cut down to £4.5 million after inheritance tax. In June 2006, much of Margaret's estate was auctioned by Christie's to meet the tax and, in her son's words, \"normal family requirements such as educating her grandchildren\".\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nActresses who have portrayed Margaret include Lucy Cohu (The Queen's Sister, 2005), Katie McGrath (The Queen, 2009), Ramona Marquez (The King's Speech, 2010), Bel Powley (A Royal Night Out, 2015), Olivia Benjamin (Father Brown, 2023), and Vanessa Kirby, Helena Bonham Carter, and Lesley Manville, who all played different stages of Margaret's life during The Crown, 2016-2023. The young Princess Margaret was played by Beau Gadsdon. The 2008 heist film, The Bank Job, revolves around alleged photos of Margaret.

His crimes, which included the murder of two women and the exhumation and mutilation of numerous corpses, shocked the nation and inspired a plethora of horror movies, books, and other works of fiction.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEdward Theodore Gein was born on August 27, 1906, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, to George Philip Gein and Augusta Wilhelmine Gein (née Lehrke). He was the second of two brothers, with an elder brother named Henry. Augusta, who was fervently religious and nominally Lutheran, frequently preached to her sons about the innate immorality of the world, the evil of drinking, and her belief that all women were naturally promiscuous and instruments of the devil. She reserved time every afternoon to read to them from the Bible, usually selecting verses from the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation concerning death, murder, and divine retribution. Gein idolized and became obsessed with his mother.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nGrowing up, Edward and his brother Henry were generally considered reliable and honest by the rest of the community. However, their home life was marked by Augusta's strict and controlling behavior, which often left them feeling isolated and emotionally distant. The brothers were frequently left to their own devices, with minimal supervision or guidance from their mother. This lack of attention and affection may have contributed to Gein's later psychological instability and violent tendencies.\n\n**Deaths in Immediate Family**\n\nOn April 1, 1940, Gein's father died of heart failure at the age of 66. Ed and his brother Henry began doing odd jobs around town to help cover living expenses. However, their mother's death on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67, was a devastating blow to Gein. Her passing marked the end of an era and left him feeling alone and adrift.\n\n**Work**\n\nAfter his mother's death, Gein held on to the family farm and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, including the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched.

she plays is a flesh-and-blood human who continues living out their life once the cameras stop rolling.\" [54] In his review of Laurel Canyon (2002), film critic Roger Ebert wrote \"In almost all of her roles, McDormand embodies an immediate, present, physical, functioning, living, breathing person as well as any actor ever has, and she plays radically different roles as easily as she walks.. How she does it is a mystery, but she does, reinventing herself, role after role McDormand is ascendant.\" [55] In his review of Nomadland (2020), film critic Leonard Maltin refers to McDormand as \"one of the finest actresses on the planet,\" stating \"because  [Fern] is played by McDormand, there is no better way to establish a connection between her and us in the audience We know she is genuine; there is no artifice here.\" [56]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMcDormand has been married to director Joel Coen since 1984 In 1995, they adopted a son from Paraguay when he was six months old The family live in Marin County, California [57] [58] [59] [60]\n\n\nActing credits and awards\nMcDormand has received numerous accolades, including three BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and one Tony Award She has received three Academy Awards for Best Actress for her performances in Fargo (1996), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), and Nomadland (2020) For producing the latter, she was also awarded the Academy Award for Best Picture, making her the first person in history to win Academy Awards both as producer and performer for the same film [5]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

A country was able to enter one swimmer per event that met the invitation standard. Any swimmer who met the \"qualifying\" time was entered in the event for the Games; a swimmer meeting the \"invitation\" standard was eligible for entry, and their entry was allotted/filled in by ranking. If a country has no swimmers who meet either of the qualifying standards, it may have entered one male and one female. A country that did not receive an allocation spot but had at least one swimmer who met a qualifying standard might have entered the swimmer with the highest ranking.\n\n### Swimming – Individual Events\n\nFINA established qualifying times for individual events.

The novel is set in a fictional world where magic exists and a perpetual darkness known as the Shadow Fold separates the land from the sea. The story follows the protagonist, Alina Starkov, a teenage girl who discovers she has the ability to summon light and becomes entangled in a world of politics, magic, and monsters.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story begins in the Kingdom of Ravka, where Alina Starkov and her childhood friend, Mal Oretsev, are part of a group of soldiers on a mission to transport a young Grisha, a person with magical abilities, across the Shadow Fold. The Shadow Fold is a dark, barren strip of land that separates the land from the sea, and is inhabited by monstrous creatures known as volcra. During the crossing, the volcra attack, and Alina displays an extraordinary talent for summoning light, which is considered a rare and powerful ability.\n\nAs a result of her display of power, Alina is taken to the Little Palace, a school for Grisha, where she is trained to harness her abilities and learn more about the world of magic. Alina soon discovers that she is a Sun Summoner, a rare type of Grisha who can summon light, and that she has the potential to become a powerful force in the world.\n\nHowever, Alina's newfound abilities attract the attention of the Darkling, a mysterious and powerful Grisha who seeks to destroy the Shadow Fold and bring about a new era of peace and prosperity to Ravka. Alina is torn between her loyalty to her friends and her desire to help the Darkling achieve his goals, and she must navigate a complex web of politics and magic to uncover the truth about her past and her destiny.\n\n**Characters**\n\nAt the heart of the story is Alina Starkov, a teenage girl who is struggling to find her place in the world. Alina is a complex and multi-dimensional character, driven by a desire to do what is right and to help those she cares about. Throughout the story, Alina faces numerous challenges and setbacks, but she always manages to find a way to persevere and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nMal Oretsev, Alina's childhood friend and love interest, is a loyal and trusted companion who is always there to support Alina. Mal is a skilled fighter and a natural leader, and he plays an important role in the story, helping Alina to navigate the complex world of politics and magic.\n\nThe Darkling, a mysterious and powerful Grisha, is a key figure in the story, and his motivations and intentions are slowly revealed throughout the novel. The Darkling is a complex and nuanced character, driven by a desire to bring about a new era of peace and prosperity to Ravka, but his methods are often questionable and his true intentions are shrouded in mystery.\n\n**Development**\n\nShadow and Bone is Leigh Bardugo's first novel, and it marked the beginning of her career as a young adult author. Bardugo drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including mythology, folklore, and fairy tales, and she wove these influences together to create a unique and compelling world.\n\nThe novel was well-received by critics and readers alike, praised for its imaginative world-building, complex characters, and engaging storyline. Shadow and Bone has been praised for its ability to evoke a sense of wonder and magic, and for its exploration of themes such as identity, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil.\n\n**Reception**\n\nShadow and Bone has been praised by critics and readers alike for its imaginative world-building, complex characters, and engaging storyline. Publishers Weekly commented that Alina's angst and aggression are a bit of a letdown, but Bardugo's storytelling and world-building more than compensate. An unnamed reviewer for Kirkus Reviews praised Bardugo for allowing the details of Grisha magic to unfold with limited exposition, using Alina's ignorance for readers' benefit, but described the world-building as being continually undercut by clunky colloquialisms.\n\nThe reviewer concluded that the plotting is powerful enough to carry most readers past flaws and into the next book in the series. Overall, Shadow and Bone has been praised for its ability to evoke a sense of wonder and magic, and for its exploration of themes such as identity, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil.\n\n**Sequels and Related Works**\n\nShadow and Bone is the first book in a trilogy, followed by Siege and Storm and Ruin and Rising. Siege and Storm was published in June 2013, and Ruin and Rising was published in June 2014.

These stories offer a deeper look into the world of Ravka and its inhabitants, and provide additional context and backstory for the events of the trilogy.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nIn September 2012, Holly Bario, president of DreamWorks' production, announced that she had picked up the movie rights to Shadow and Bone. David Heyman, who produced the Harry Potter films, was announced as producer, and Jeffrey Clifford, president of Heyday Films, would also produce the film.

{"title": "Khalistan_movement", "content": "\nPre-1950s\nSikhs have been concentrated in the Punjab region of South Asia [23] Before its conquest by the British, the region around Punjab had been ruled by the confederacy of Sikh Misls The Misls ruled over the eastern Punjab from 1733 to 1799, [24] until their confederacy was unified into the Sikh Empire by Maharajah Ranjit Singh from 1799 to 1849 [25]\n\n\nPartition of India, 1947\nBefore the 1947 partition of India, Sikhs were not in majority in any of the districts of pre-partition British Punjab Province other than Ludhiana (where Sikhs formed 41.6% of the population) [33] Rather, districts in the region had a majority of either the Hindus or Muslims depending on its location in the province.\n\n\nSikh relationship with Punjab (via Oberoi)\nSikh historian Harjot Singh Oberoi argues that, despite the historical linkages between Sikhs and Punjab, territory has never been a major element of Sikh self-definition He makes the case that the attachment of Punjab with Sikhism is a recent phenomenon, stemming from the 1940s [35] Historically, Sikhism has been pan-Indian, with the Guru Granth Sahib (the main scripture of Sikhism) drawing from works of saints in both North and South India, while several major seats in Sikhism (e.g Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, Takht Sri Patna Sahib in Bihar, and Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra) are located outside of Punjab [36]\n\n\n1950s to 1970s\nThere are two distinct narratives about the origins of the calls for a sovereign Khalistan One refers to the events within India itself, while the other privileges the role of the Sikh diaspora Both of these narratives vary in the form of governance proposed for this state (e.g theocracy vs democracy) as well as the proposed name (i.e Sikhistan vs Khalistan) Even the precise geographical borders of the proposed state differs among them although it was generally imagined to be carved out from one of various historical constructions of the Punjab [39]\n\n\nEmergence in India\nEstablished on 14 December 1920, Akali Dal was a Sikh political party that sought to form a government in Punjab [40]\n\n\nAnandpur Resolution\nAs Punjab and Haryana now shared the capital of Chandigarh, resentment was felt among Sikhs in Punjab [40] Adding further grievance, a canal system was put in place over the rivers of Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej, which flowed through Punjab, in order for water to also reach Haryana and Rajasthan As result, Punjab would only receive 23% of the water while the rest would go to the two other states The fact that the issue would not be revisited brought on additional turmoil to Sikh resentment against Congress [40]\n\n\nEmergence in the diaspora\nAccording to the 'events outside India' narrative, particularly after 1971, the notion of a sovereign and independent state of Khalistan began to get popularized among Sikhs in North America and Europe One such account is provided by the Khalistan Council which had moorings in West London, where the Khalistan movement is said to have been launched in 1970 [39]\n\n\nChohan in Pakistan and US\nFollowing the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Chohan visited Pakistan as a guest of such leaders as Chaudhuri Zahoor Elahi Visiting Nankana Sahib and several historical gurdwaras in Pakistan, Chohan utilized the opportunity to spread the notion of an independent Sikh state Widely publicized by Pakistani press, the extensive coverage of his remarks introduced the international community, including those in India, to the demand of Khalistan for the first time Though lacking public support, the term Khalistan became more and more recognizable [49] According to Chohan, during a talk with Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan, Bhutto had proposed to make Nankana Sahib the capital of Khalistan [52]\n\n\nCouncil of Khalistan\nAfter returning to India in 1977, Chohan travelled to Britain in 1979 There, he would establish the Council of Khalistan, [53] declaring its formation at Anandpur Sahib on 12 April 1980 Chohan designated himself as President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General.\n\n\nOperation Blue Star and impact\nIn later disclosures from former special secretary G.B.S Sidhu of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), the foreign-intelligence agency of India, R&AW itself helped \"build the Khalistan legend,\" actively participating in the planning of Operation Blue Star While posted in Ottawa, Canada in 1976 to look into the \"Khalistan problem\" among the Sikh diaspora, Sidhu found \"nothing amiss\" during the three years he was there, [54] stating that \"Delhi was unnecessarily making a mountain of a molehill where none existed,\" that the agency created seven posts in West Europe and North America in 1981 to counter non-existent Khalistan activities, and that the deployed officers were \"not always familiar with the Sikhs or the Punjab issue.\" [54] He described the secessionist movement as a \"chimera\" until the army operation, after which the insurgency would start [54]\n\n\nLate 1970s to 1983\nThe Akali leaders, having planned to announce a victory for Dharam Yudh Morcha, were outraged by the changes to the agreed-upon settlement In November 1982, Akali leader Harchand Singh Longowal announced that the party would disrupt the 9th annual

including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina, or Buddhist religion,\" while also implicitly recognizing Sikhism as a separate religion: \"the wearing and carrying of kripans  [sic] shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion.\" [61]: 109  Even today, this clause is deemed offensive by many religious minorities in India due to its failure to recognise such religions separately under the constitution [61]\n\n\nOperation Blue Star\nOperation Blue Star was an Indian military operation ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, between 1 and 8 June 1984, to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex (aka the Golden Temple) in Amritsar, Punjab – the most sacred

people aboard were killed, [83] 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens and 24 Indian citizens, including the flight crew On the same day, an explosion due to a luggage bomb was linked to the terrorist operation and occurred at the Narita Airport in Tokyo, Japan, intended for Air India Flight 301, killing two baggage handlers The entire event was inter-continental in scope, killing 331 people in total and affected five countries on different continents: Canada, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, and Ireland.\n\n\nLate 1980s\nIn 1986, when the insurgency was at its peak, the Golden Temple was again occupied by militants belonging to the All India Sikh Students Federation and Damdami Taksal The militants called an assembly (Sarbat Khalsa) and, on 26 January, they passed a resolution (gurmattā) in favour of the creation of Khalistan [89] However, only the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) had the authority to appoint the jathedar, the supreme religio-temporal seat of the Sikhs The militants thus dissolved the SGPC and appointed their own jathedar, who turned out to refuse their bidding as well Militant leader Gurbachan Singh Manochahal thereby appointed himself by force [16]\n\n\n1990s\nIndian security forces suppressed the insurgency in the early 1990s, while Sikh political groups such as the Khalsa Raj Party and SAD (A) continued to pursue an independent Khalistan through non-violent means [96] [97] [98] Whereas to take iron from the terrorists in the village Bhikhiwind, district Tarn Taran 'Sandhu' family fought everyday like the last day and defeated terrorists several times One such incident was on 30 September 1990, when about 200 terrorists attacked Balwinder Singh's house In retaliation, the Sandhu family using weapons provided by state police killed several and compiled the rest of the terrorists to run away The Family awarded the Shaurya Chakra to show most conspicuous bravery, indomitable courage [99]\n\n\n2000s\nThere have been serious charges levelled by human rights activists against Indian Security forces (headed by Sikh police officer, K P S Gill), claiming that thousands of suspects were killed in staged shootouts and thousands of bodies were cremated/disposed of without proper identification or post-mortems [109] [110] [111] [112] Human Rights Watch reported that, since 1984, government forces had resorted to widespread human rights violations to fight the militants, including: arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention without trial, torture, and summary executions of civilians and suspected militants Family members were frequently detained and tortured to reveal the whereabouts of relatives sought by the police [113] [114] Amnesty International has alleged several cases of disappearances, torture, rape, and unlawful detentions by the police during the Punjab insurgency, for which 75–100 police officers had been convicted by December 2002 [115]\n\n\nRetribution\nThere have been serious charges levelled by human rights activists against Indian Security forces (headed by Sikh police officer, K P S Gill), claiming that thousands of

Justice to kill multiple Dera leaders in India [116] [117] Pro-Khalistan organisations such as Dal Khalsa are also active outside India, supported by a section of the Sikh diaspora [118] As of 25 December, there also have been inputs by multiple agencies about a possible attack in Punjab by Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Zindabad Force, according to Indian Media sources, are allegedly in contact with their Pakistani handlers and are trying to smuggle arms across the border [119] [120]\n\n\n2020s\nIn 2021, the secessionist group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), began an unofficial, non binding, ongoing \"referendum\" regarding the potential creation of a Khalistan state which would include the entire states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh, and several districts of other Indian states Numerous referendum votes have been held in various locations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Italy, England, and the United States Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have partaken in these votes according to various news reports \n\n\nElectoral performance of pro-Khalistan parties and candidates\nIn the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), a splinter group of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and the only pro Khalistan party in India, [193] contested 81 out of the 117 seats in the Punjab Legislative Assembly and received 386,176 votes or 2.48% of the vote share SAD(A) received 49,260 votes (0.3% of the vote share) in the 2017 Legislative Assembly election \n\n\nMilitancy\nDuring the late 1980s and the early 1990s, there was a dramatic rise in radical State militancy in Punjab The 1984 military Operation Blue Star in the Golden Temple in Amritsar offended many Sikhs [198] The separatists used this event, as well as the following 1984 anti-Sikh riots, to claim that the interest of Sikhs was not safe in India and to foster the spread of militancy among Sikhs in Punjab Some sections of the Sikh diaspora also began join the separatists with financial and diplomatic support [38]\n\n\nMilitant groups\nThere are several militant Sikh groups, such as the Khalistan Council, that are currently functional and provides organization and guidance to the Sikh community Multiple groups are organized across the world, coordinating their military efforts for Khalistan Such groups were most active in 1980s and early 1990s, and have since receded in activity These groups are largely defunct in India but they still have a political presence among the Sikh diaspora, especially in countries such as Pakistan where they are not proscribed by law [201]\n\n\nAbatement\nThe U.S Department of State found that Sikh extremism had decreased significantly from 1992 to 1997, although a 1997 report noted that \"Sikh militant cells are active internationally and extremists gather funds from overseas Sikh communities.\" [217]\n\n\nOutside of India\nOperation Blue Star and its violent aftermaths popularized the demand for Khalistan among many Sikhs dispersed globally [220] Involvement of sections of Sikh diaspora turned out to be important for the movement as it provided the diplomatic and financial support It also enabled Pakistan to become involved in the fueling of the movement Sikhs in UK, Canada and USA arranged for cadres to travel to Pakistan for military and financial assistance Some Sikh groups abroad even declared themselves as the Khalistani government in exile [38]\n\n\nPakistan\nPakistan has long aspired to dismember India through its Bleed India strategy Even before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then a member of the military regime of General Yahya Khan, stated, \"Once the back of Indian forces is broken in the east, Pakistan should occupy the whole of Eastern India and make it a permanent part of East Pakistan... Kashmir should be taken at any price, even the Sikh Punjab and turned into Khalistan.\" [226]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe New York Times reported in June 1984 that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi conveyed to Helmut Schmidt and Willy Brandt, both of them being former Chancellors of West Germany, that United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in causing unrest in Punjab It also reported that The Indian Express quoted anonymous officials from India's intelligence establishment as saying that the CIA \"masterminded\" a plan to support the acolytes of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who died during Operation Blue Star, by smuggling weapons for them through Pakistan [232] The United States embassy denied this report's findings [232]\n\n\nCanada\nImmediately after Operation Blue Star, authorities were unprepared for how quickly extremism spread and gained support in Canada, with extremists \"...threatening to kill thousands of Hindus by a number of means, including blowing up Air India flights.\" [236] [237] Canadian Member of Parliament Ujjal Dosanjh, a moderate Sikh, stated that he and others who spoke out against Sikh extremism in the 1980s faced a \"reign of terror\" [238]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn February 2008, BBC Radio 4 reported that the Chief of the Punjab Police, NPS Aulakh, alleged that militant groups were receiving money from the British Sikh community [257] The same report included statements that although the Sikh militant groups were poorly equipped and staffed, intelligence reports and interrogations indicated that Babbar Khalsa was sending its recruits to the same terrorist training camps in Pakistan used by Al Qaeda [258]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nSecondary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Khalistan movement is a political and separatist movement that has been active since the 1950s, primarily among the Sikh community in India. The movement seeks to establish a sovereign state called Khalistan, which would be separate from the Indian Union.\n\n## Pre-1950s\n\nSikhs have been concentrated in the Punjab region of South Asia. Before its conquest by the British, the region around Punjab had been ruled by the confederacy of Sikh Misls. The Misls ruled over the eastern Punjab from 1733 to 1799, until their confederacy was unified into the Sikh Empire by Maharajah Ranjit Singh from 1799 to 1849.\n\n## Partition of India, 1947\n\nBefore the 1947 partition of India, Sikhs were not in majority in any of the districts of pre-partition British Punjab Province other than Ludhiana (where Sikhs formed 41.6% of the population). Rather, districts in the region had a majority of either the Hindus or Muslims depending on its location in the province.\n\n## Sikh relationship with Punjab\n\nSikh historian Harjot Singh Oberoi argues that, despite the historical linkages between Sikhs and Punjab, territory has never been a major element of Sikh self-definition. He makes the case that the attachment of Punjab with Sikhism is a recent phenomenon, stemming from the 1940s. Historically, Sikhism has been pan-Indian, with the Guru Granth Sahib (the main scripture of Sikhism) drawing from works of saints in both North and South India, while several major seats in Sikhism (e.g Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, Takht Sri Patna Sahib in Bihar, and Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra) are located outside of Punjab.\n\n## 1950s to 1970s\n\nThere are two distinct narratives about the origins of the calls for a sovereign Khalistan. One refers to the events within India itself, while the other privileges the role of the Sikh diaspora. Both of these narratives vary in the form of governance proposed for this state (e.g theocracy vs democracy) as well as the proposed name (i.e Sikhistan vs Khalistan). Even the precise geographical borders of the proposed state differs among them although it was generally imagined to be carved out from one of various historical constructions of the Punjab.\n\n## Emergence in India\n\nEstablished on 14 December 1920, Akali Dal was a Sikh political party that sought to form a government in Punjab. The party's early leaders, such as Master Tara Singh, were vocal advocates of Sikh autonomy and later, full-fledged independence.\n\n## Anandpur Resolution\n\nAs Punjab and Haryana now shared the capital of Chandigarh, resentment was felt among Sikhs in Punjab. Adding further grievance, a canal system was put in place over the rivers of Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej, which flowed through Punjab, in order for water to also reach Haryana and Rajasthan. As a result, Punjab would only receive 23% of the water while the rest would go to the two other states. The fact that the issue would not be revisited brought on additional turmoil to Sikh resentment against Congress.\n\n## Emergence in the diaspora\n\nAccording to the 'events outside India' narrative, particularly after 1971, the notion of a sovereign and independent state of Khalistan began to get popularized among Sikhs in North America and Europe. One such account is provided by the Khalistan Council which had moorings in West London, where the Khalistan movement is said to have been launched in 1970.\n\n## Council of Khalistan\n\nAfter returning to India in 1977, Jagjit Singh Chohan travelled to Britain in 1979. There, he would establish the Council of Khalistan, declaring its formation at Anandpur Sahib on 12 April 1980. Chohan designated himself as President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General.\n\n## Operation Blue Star and impact\n\nIn later disclosures from former special secretary G.B.S Sidhu of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), the foreign-intelligence agency of India, R&AW itself helped \"build the Khalistan legend,\" actively participating in the planning of Operation Blue Star. While posted in Ottawa, Canada in 1976 to look into the \"Khalistan problem\" among the Sikh diaspora, Sidhu found \"nothing amiss\" during the three years he was there, stating that \"Delhi was unnecessarily making a mountain of a molehill where none existed.\"\n\n## Late 1970s to 1983\n\nThe Akali leaders, having planned to announce a victory for Dharam Yudh Morcha, were outraged by the changes to the agreed-upon settlement. In November 1982, Akali leader Harchand Singh Longowal announced that the party would disrupt the 9th annual Asian Games by sending groups of Akali workers to Delhi to intentionally get arrested. Following negotiations between the Akali Dal and the government failed at the last moment due to disagreements regarding the transfer of areas between Punjab and Haryana.\n\n## 1984\n\nWidespread murders by followers of Bhindranwale occurred in 1980s' Punjab. Armed Khalistani militants of this period described themselves as kharku.

of Khalistan [52]\n\n\nCouncil of Khalistan\nAfter returning to India in 1977, Chohan travelled to Britain in 1979 There, he would establish the Council of Khalistan, [53] declaring its formation at Anandpur Sahib on 12 April 1980 Chohan designated himself as President of the Council and Balbir Singh Sandhu as its Secretary General.\n\n\nOperation Blue Star and impact\nIn later disclosures from former special secretary G.B.S Sidhu of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), the foreign-intelligence agency of India, R&AW itself helped \"build the Khalistan legend,\" actively participating in the planning of Operation Blue Star While posted in Ottawa, Canada in 1976 to look into the \"Khalistan problem\" among the Sikh diaspora, Sidhu found \"nothing amiss\" during the three years he was there, [54] stating that \"Delhi was unnecessarily making a mountain of a molehill where none existed,\" that the agency created seven posts in West Europe and North America in 1981 to counter non-existent Khalistan activities, and that the deployed officers were \"not always familiar with the Sikhs or the Punjab issue.\" [54] He described the secessionist movement as a \"chimera\" until the army operation, after which the insurgency would start [54]\n\n\nLate 1970s to 1983\nThe Akali leaders, having planned to announce a victory for Dharam Yudh Morcha, were outraged by the changes to the agreed-upon settlement In November 1982, Akali leader Harchand Singh Longowal announced that the party would disrupt the 9th annual Asian Games by sending groups of Akali workers to Delhi to intentionally get arrested Following negotiations between the Akali Dal and the government failed at the last moment due to disagreements regarding the transfer of areas between Punjab and Haryana [56]\n\n\nDelhi Asian Games (1982)\nThe Akali leaders, having planned to announce a victory for Dharam Yudh Morcha, were outraged by the changes to the agreed-upon settlement In November 1982, Akali leader Harchand Singh Longowal announced that the party would disrupt the 9th annual Asian Games by sending groups of Akali workers to Delhi to intentionally get arrested Following negotiations between the Akali Dal and the government failed at the last moment due to disagreements regarding the transfer of areas between Punjab and Haryana [56]\n\n\n1984\nWidespread murders by followers of Bhindranwale occurred in 1980s' Punjab Armed Khalistani militants of this period described themselves as kharku [58]\n\n\nIncreasing militant activity\nWidespread murders by followers of Bhindranwale occurred in 1980s' Punjab Armed Khalistani militants of this period described themselves as kharku [58]\n\n\nConstitutional issues\nThe Akali Dal began more agitation in February 1984, protesting against Article 25, clause (2)(b), of the Indian Constitution, which ambiguously explains that \"the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina, or Buddhist religion,\" while also implicitly recognizing Sikhism as a separate religion: \"the wearing and carrying of kripans  [sic] shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion.\" [61]: 109  Even today, this clause is deemed offensive by many religious minorities in India due to its failure to recognise such religions separately under the constitution [61]\n\n\nOperation Blue Star\nOperation Blue Star was an Indian military operation ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, between 1 and 8 June 1984, to remove militant religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his armed followers from the buildings of the Harmandir Sahib complex (aka the Golden Temple) in Amritsar, Punjab – the most sacred site in Sikhism [62]\n\n\nAssassination of Indira Gandhi and anti-Sikh riots\nOn the morning of 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi by her two personal security guards Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, both Sikhs, in retaliation for Operation Blue Star [38] The assassination triggered the 1984 anti-Sikh riots across North India While the ruling party, Indian National Congress (INC), maintained that the violence was due to spontaneous riots, its critics have alleged that INC members themselves had planned a pogrom against the Sikhs [78]\n\n\n1985 to present day\nMany Sikh and Hindu groups, as well as organisations not affiliated to any religion, have attempted to establish peace between the Khalistan proponents and the Government of India [citation needed] Akalis continued to witness radicalization of Sikh politics, fearing disastrous consequences [40] In response, President Harchand Singh Longowal reinstated the head of the Akali Dal and pushed for a peace initiative that reiterated the importance of Hindu-Sikh amity, condemning Sikh extremist violence, therefore declaring that the Akali Dal was not in favor of Khalistan.\n\n\n1985\nMany Sikh and Hindu groups, as well

reiterated the importance of Hindu-Sikh amity, condemning Sikh extremist violence, therefore declaring that the Akali Dal was not in favor of Khalistan.\n\n\nAir India Flight 182\nAir India Flight 182 was an Air India flight operating on the Montréal-London-Delhi-Bombay route On 23 June 1985, a Boeing 747 operating on the route was blown up by a bomb mid-air off the coast of Ireland A total of 329 people aboard were killed, [83] 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens and 24 Indian citizens, including the flight crew On the same day, an explosion due to a luggage bomb was linked to the terrorist operation and occurred at the Narita Airport in Tokyo, Japan, intended for Air India Flight 301, killing two baggage handlers The entire event was inter-continental in scope, killing 331 people in total and affected five countries on different continents: Canada, the United Kingdom, India, Japan, and Ireland.\n\n\nLate 1980s\nIn 1986, when the insurgency was at its peak, the Golden Temple was again occupied by militants belonging to the All India Sikh Students Federation and Damdami Taksal The militants called an assembly (Sarbat Khalsa) and, on 26 January, they passed a resolution (gurmattā) in favour of the creation of Khalistan [89] However, only the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) had the authority to appoint the jathedar, the supreme religio-temporal seat of the Sikhs The militants thus dissolved the SGPC and appointed their own jathedar, who turned out to refuse their bidding as well Militant leader Gurbachan Singh Manochahal thereby appointed himself by force [16]\n\n\n1990s\nIndian security forces suppressed the insurgency in the early 1990s, while Sikh political groups such as the Khalsa Raj Party and SAD (A) continued to pursue an independent Khalistan through non-violent means [96] [97] [98] Whereas to take iron from the terrorists in the village Bhikhiwind, district Tarn Taran 'Sandhu' family fought everyday like the last day and defeated terrorists several times One such incident was on 30 September 1990, when about 200 terrorists attacked Balwinder Singh's house In retaliation, the Sandhu family using weapons provided by state police killed several and compiled the rest of the terrorists to run away The Family awarded the Shaurya Chakra to show most conspicuous bravery, indomitable courage [99]\n\n\n2000s\nThere have been serious charges levelled by human rights activists against Indian Security forces (headed by Sikh police officer, K P S Gill), claiming that thousands of suspects were killed in staged shootouts and thousands of bodies were cremated/disposed of without proper identification or post-mortems [109] [110] [111] [112] Human Rights Watch reported that, since 1984, government forces had resorted to widespread human rights violations to fight the militants, including: arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention without trial, torture, and summary executions of civilians and suspected militants Family members were frequently detained and tortured to reveal the whereabouts of relatives sought by the police [113] [114] Amnesty International has alleged several cases of disappearances, torture, rape, and unlawful detentions by the police during the Punjab insurgency, for which 75–100 police officers had been convicted by December 2002 [115]\n\n\nRetribution\nThere have been serious charges levelled by human rights activists against Indian Security forces (headed by Sikh police officer, K P S Gill), claiming that thousands of suspects were killed in staged shootouts and thousands of bodies were cremated/disposed of without proper identification or post-mortems [109] [110] [111] [112] Human Rights Watch reported that, since 1984, government forces had resorted to widespread human rights violations to fight the militants, including: arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention without trial, torture, and summary executions of

cases of disappearances, torture, rape, and unlawful detentions by the police during the Punjab insurgency, for which 75–100 police officers had been convicted by December 2002 [115]\n\n\n2010s\nActivities in the 2010s by Khalistani militants include the Tarn Taran blast, in which a police crackdown arrested 4 terrorists, one of whom revealed they were ordered by Sikhs for Justice to kill multiple Dera leaders in India [116] [117] Pro-Khalistan organisations such as Dal Khalsa are also active outside India, supported by a section of the Sikh diaspora [118] As of 25 December, there also have been inputs by multiple agencies about a possible attack in Punjab by Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Zindabad Force, according to Indian Media sources, are allegedly in contact with their Pakistani handlers and are trying to smuggle arms across the border [119] [120]\n\n\n2020s\nIn 2021, the secessionist group, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), began an unofficial, non binding, ongoing \"referendum\" regarding the potential creation of a Khalistan state which would include the entire states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh, and several districts of other Indian states Numerous referendum votes have been held in various locations including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Italy, England, and the United States Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs have partaken in these votes according to various news reports \n\n\nElectoral performance of pro-Khalistan parties and candidates\nIn the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), a splinter group of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and the only pro Khalistan party in India, [193] contested 81 out of the 117 seats in the Punjab Legislative Assembly and received 386,176 votes or 2.48% of the vote share SAD(A) received 49,260 votes (0.3% of the vote share) in the 2017 Legislative Assembly election \n\n\nMilitancy\nDuring the late 1980s and the early 1990s, there was a dramatic rise in radical State militancy in Punjab The 1984 military Operation Blue Star in the Golden Temple in Amritsar offended many Sikhs [198] The separatists used this event, as well as the following 1984 anti-Sikh riots, to claim that the interest of Sikhs was not safe in India and to foster the spread of militancy among Sikhs in Punjab Some sections of the Sikh diaspora also began join the separatists with financial and diplomatic support [38]\n\n\nMilitant groups\nThere are several militant Sikh groups, such as the Khalistan Council, that are currently functional and provides organization and guidance to the Sikh community Multiple groups are organized across the world, coordinating their military efforts for Khalistan Such groups were most active in 1980s and early 1990s, and have since receded in activity These groups are largely defunct in India but they still have a political presence among the Sikh diaspora, especially in countries such as Pakistan where they are not proscribed by law [201]\n\n\nAbatement\nThe U.S Department of State found that Sikh extremism had decreased significantly from 1992 to 1997, although a 1997 report noted that \"Sikh militant cells are active internationally and extremists gather funds from overseas Sikh communities.\" [217]\n\n\nOutside of India\nOperation Blue Star and its violent aftermaths popularized the demand for Khalistan among many Sikhs dispersed globally [220] Involvement of sections of Sikh diaspora turned out to be important for the movement as it provided the diplomatic and financial support It also enabled Pakistan to become involved in the fueling of the movement Sikhs in UK, Canada and USA arranged for cadres to travel to Pakistan for military and financial assistance Some Sikh groups abroad even declared themselves as the Khalistani government in exile [38]\n\n\nPakistan\nPakistan has long aspired to dismember India through its Bleed India strategy Even before the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then a member of the military regime of General Yahya Khan, stated, \"Once the back of Indian forces is broken in the east, Pakistan should occupy the whole of Eastern India and make it a permanent part of East Pakistan... Kashmir should be taken at any price, even the Sikh Punjab and turned into Khalistan.\" [226]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe New York Times reported in June 1984 that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi conveyed to Helmut Schmidt and Willy Brandt, both of them being former Chancellors of West Germany, that United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in causing unrest in Punjab It also reported that The Indian Express quoted anonymous officials from India's intelligence establishment as saying that the CIA \"masterminded\" a plan to support the acolytes of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who died during Operation Blue Star, by smuggling weapons for them through Pakistan [232] The United States embassy denied this report's findings [232]\n\n\nCanada\nImmediately after Operation Blue Star, authorities were unprepared for how quickly extremism spread and gained support in Canada, with extremists \"...threatening to kill thousands of Hindus by a number of means, including blowing up Air India flights.\" [236] [237] Canadian Member of Parliament Ujjal Dosanjh, a moderate Sikh, stated that he and others who spoke out against Sikh extremism in the 1980s faced a \"reign of terror\" [238]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn February 2008, BBC Radio 4 reported that the Chief of the Punjab Police, NPS Aulakh, alleged that militant groups were receiving money from the British Sikh community [257] The same report included statements that although the Sikh militant groups were poorly equipped and staffed, intelligence reports and interrogations indicated that Babbar Khalsa was sending its recruits to the same terrorist training camps in Pakistan used by Al Qaeda [258]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nSecondary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These tax havens often have low or no corporate taxes, which encourages companies to shift their profits to these countries and inflate their GDP. This can result in an overestimation of the country's economic performance and standard of living.\n\nExamples of tax havens that are often listed among the top GDP-per-capita countries include:\n\n* Luxembourg, which has a corporate tax rate of 0% on profits from intellectual property and a low effective tax rate of 2.5% on other profits\n* Ireland, which has a corporate tax rate of 12.5% and a low effective tax rate of 6.7% due to tax loopholes and incentives\n* Singapore, which has a corporate tax rate of 8.5% and a low effective tax rate of 3.3% due to tax incentives and exemptions\n\nThese tax havens often have a high proportion of foreign-owned businesses and a low proportion of domestic businesses, which can distort their GDP-per-capita calculations.\n\n## See also\n\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n* Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n## Notes\n\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n* Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n## References\n\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n* Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n## External links\n\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP\n* Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n* Top country metropolitan by GDP", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita\" following this outline:\n\n\nTable\nThe table initially ranks each country or territory by its IMF estimate, and can be reranked by any of the sources.\n\n\nDistorted GDP-per-capita for tax havens\nMany of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries.\n\n\nSee also\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n*Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n\nNotes\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n*Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n\nReferences\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n*Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n\nExternal links\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP\n*Top country subdivisions by GDP per capita\n*Top country metropolitan by GDP\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Lincoln took the death very hard, saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann's grave Lincoln sank into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her [47] [48] [49]\n\n\nEarly career and militia service\nDuring 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem, Illinois In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War [63] When Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War, he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit Because a license was required to sell customers beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well [citation needed]\n\n\nIllinois state legislature (1834–1842)\nLincoln's second state house campaign in 1834, this time as a Whig, was a success over a powerful Whig opponent [69] Then followed his four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County [70] He championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and later was a Canal Commissioner [71] He voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a \"free soil\" stance opposing both slavery and abolition [72] In 1837, he declared, \" [The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\" [73] He echoed Henry Clay's support for the American Colonization Society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in Liberia [74]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1847–1849)\nTrue to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay\" [82] Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization [83]\n\n\nPolitical views\nOn foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the Mexican–American War, which he imputed President James K Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\" [88] He supported the Wilmot Proviso, a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S territory won from Mexico [89]\n\n\nPrairie lawyer\nIn his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\" [98] Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years [99] Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him [100] He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in Hurd v Rock Island Bridge Company, a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge [101] In 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water The idea was never commercialized, but it made Lincoln the only president to hold a patent [102]\n\n\nRepublican politics (1854–1860)\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue [110] In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue [111] As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854 [112]\n\n\nEmergence as Republican leader\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue [110] In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue [111] As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise;

Sandford\nDred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the Missouri Compromise After Scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom His petition was denied in Dred Scott v Sandford (1857) [i] In his opinion, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' \"property\" rights While many Democrats hoped that Dred Scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North [129] Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power [130] He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal \"in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" [131]\n\n\nLincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech\nIn 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor [132] Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state [133] Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition [134]\n\n\n1860 presidential election\nOn May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur [154] Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement [155] Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\" [156] In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" [157] Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy [158]\n\n\nPresidency (1861–1865)\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861 [174] On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed [175] Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America, and adopted a constitution [176] The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal [177] President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal [178] The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional president on February 9, 1861 [179]\n\n\nSecession and inauguration\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861 [174] On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed [175] Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America, and adopted a constitution [176] The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal [177] President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal [178] The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional president on February 9, 1861 [179]\n\n\nCivil War\nMajor Robert Anderson, commander of the Union's Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion [194]\n\n\nUnion military strategy\nLincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the Union military strategy He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict [202]\n\n\nGeneral McClellan\nAfter the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B McClellan general-in-chief [218] McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capital [219]\n\n\nEmancipation Proclamation\nThe federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states He sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves [232] Lincoln rejected Major General John C Frémont's August 1861 emancipation attempt, as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede [233]\n\n\nGettysburg Address (1863)\nLincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863 [251] In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\" He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that the future of democracy would be assured, and that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\" [252]\n\n\nPromoting General Grant\nGeneral Ulysses Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can't spare this man He fights.\" [254] With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander Grant then assumed command of Meade's army [255]\n\n\nReelection\nLincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions along with War Democrats Edwin M Stanton and Andrew Johnson Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him [269] At its convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson as his running mate To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party [270]\n\n\nReconstruction\nReconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\" [278] Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one [279] Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep Thaddeus Stevens, Sen Charles Sumner and Sen Benjamin Wade, who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance [280]\n\n\nNative Americans\nLincoln's relationship with Native Americans started before he was born, with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons, including Lincoln's father Thomas [289] Lincoln himself served as a captain in the state militia during the Black Hawk War but saw no combat [290] Lincoln used appointments to the Indian Bureau as a reward to supporters from Minnesota and Wisconsin While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks [291]\n\n\nWhig theory of a presidency\nLincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating Under this philosophy, Lincoln vetoed only four bills during his presidency, including the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program [308] The 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost The 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869 [309] The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s [310]\n\n\nSupreme Court appointments\nLincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\" [319] Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court Noah Haynes Swayne was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union Samuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced Democrat Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P Chase, became Chief Justice Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party [321]\n\n\nForeign policy\nLincoln named his main political rival, William H Seward, as Secretary of State and left most diplomatic issues in Seward's portfolio However, Lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy [322] He also closely watched the handling of the Trent Affair in late 1861 to make sure the situation did not escalate into war with Britain [323] Seward's main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy He was successful after indicating to Britain and France that the Union would declare war on them if they supported the South [324]\n\n\nAssassination\nJohn Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service [325] After attending Lincoln's last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically \"on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers\", [326] Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President [327] When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford's Theatre \"Booth had attended a dress rehearsal the day before to better rehearse his scheme for shooting Lincoln .. and then escaping.\" [328] Lincoln and his wife attended the play Our American Cousin on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play [329]\n\n\nFuneral and burial\nThe late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 to 21 The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train [340] The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing [341] or in silent grief Poet Walt Whitman composed \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln [342] African Americans were especially moved; they had lost their \"Moses\" [343] In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war [344] Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death [345] Lincoln's body was buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield and now lies within the Lincoln Tomb [346]\n\n\nReligious and philosophical beliefs\nAs a young man Lincoln was a religious skeptic [347] He was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoting and praising it [348] He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others [349] He never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs [350] Throughout his public career, Lincoln often quoted Scripture [351] His three most famous speeches—the House Divided Speech, the Gettysburg Address, and his second inaugural—all contain direct allusions to Providence and quote from Scripture.\n\n\nHealth\nLincoln is believed to have had depression, smallpox, and malaria [364] He took blue mass pills, which contained mercury, [365] to treat constipation [366] It is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning [367]\n\n\nLegacy\nLincoln's redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick Diggins, Harry V Jaffa, Vernon Burton, Eric Foner, and Herman J Belz [369] Lincoln called the Declaration of Independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism beginning in the 1850s He did this at a time when the Constitution, which \"tolerated slavery\", was the focus of most political discourse [370] Diggins notes, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself\" in the 1860 Cooper Union speech [371] Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism [372]\n\n\nRepublican values\nLincoln's redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians

secession as anarchy, and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints He said, \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\" [380]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nIn his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color [382]\n\nMemory and memorials\nLincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill He appears on postage stamps across the world [418] [419] While he is usually portrayed bearded, he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell He was the first of five presidents to do so

Lincoln\n\nAbraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential leaders in American history, known for his strong leadership during the Civil War and his commitment to preserving the Union.\n\n**Family and Childhood**\n\nAbraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln. Lincoln's family was of English and Scottish descent, and his father was a farmer and a carpenter. Lincoln's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but he was also exposed to education and literature through his mother, who encouraged his love of reading and learning.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLincoln's formal education was limited, but he was largely self-educated. He attended school for only a few months, but he continued to read and learn on his own. As a young man, Lincoln worked as a store clerk, a surveyor, and a postmaster, but he eventually moved to Springfield, Illinois, where he became a lawyer and established a successful practice.\n\n**Marriage and Children**\n\nLincoln married Mary Todd in 1842, and the couple had four children together. Their eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, was the only one of their children to survive to adulthood.\n\n**Early Career and Militia Service**\n\nIn 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem, Illinois. In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War. After the war, Lincoln returned to his law practice and eventually formed a partnership with a fellow lawyer, William Berry.\n\n**Illinois State Legislature (1834–1842)**\n\nLincoln's second state house campaign in 1834 was a success, and he went on to serve four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County. He championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and later served as a Canal Commissioner. Lincoln also voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a \"free soil\" stance opposing both slavery and abolition.\n\n**U.S. House of Representatives (1847–1849)**\n\nTrue to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay.\" Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization.\n\n**Prairie Lawyer**\n\nIn his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer.\" Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years. Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges.\n\n**Republican Politics (1854–1860)**\n\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue. In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue.\n\n**Emergence as Republican Leader**\n\nIn 1858, Lincoln was up for re-election in the U.S Senate, and he hoped to defeat Senator Stephen A Douglas. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.\n\n**1860 Presidential Election**\n\nOn May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur, and Lincoln received his first endorsement. Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate.\" In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\"\n\n**Presidency (1861–1865)**\n\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861.

Lincoln took the death very hard, saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann's grave Lincoln sank into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her [47] [48] [49]\n\n\nEarly career and militia service\nDuring 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem, Illinois In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War [63] When Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War, he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit Because a license was required to sell customers beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well [citation needed]\n\n\nIllinois state legislature (1834–1842)\nLincoln's second state house campaign in 1834, this time as a Whig, was a success over a powerful Whig opponent [69] Then followed his four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County [70] He championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and later was a Canal Commissioner [71] He voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a \"free soil\" stance opposing both slavery and abolition [72] In 1837, he declared, \" [The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\" [73] He echoed Henry Clay's support for the American Colonization Society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in Liberia [74]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1847–1849)\nTrue to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay\" [82] Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization [83]\n\n\nPolitical views\nOn foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the Mexican–American War, which he imputed President James K Polk's desire for \"military glory — that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\" [88] He supported the Wilmot Proviso, a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S territory won from Mexico [89]\n\n\nPrairie lawyer\nIn his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\" [98] Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years [99] Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him [100] He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in Hurd v Rock Island Bridge Company, a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge [101] In 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water The idea was never commercialized, but it made Lincoln the only president to hold a patent [102]\n\n\nRepublican politics (1854–1860)\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue [110] In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue [111] As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854 [112]\n\n\nEmergence as Republican leader\nThe debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue [110] In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue [111] As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854 [112]\n\n\n1856 campaign\nViolent political confrontations in Kansas continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union [124] At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, John C Frémont and William Dayton were on the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore [125] Buchanan prevailed, while Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois [126] [h]\n\n\nDred Scott v. Sandford\nDred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the Missouri Compromise After Scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom His petition was denied in Dred Scott v Sandford (1857) [i] In his opinion, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' \"property\" rights While many Democrats hoped that Dred Scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North [129] Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power [130] He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal \"in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" [131]\n\n\nLincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech\nIn 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor [132] Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state [133] Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition [134]\n\n\n1860 presidential election\nOn May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur [154] Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement [155] Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\" [156] In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\" [157] Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy [158]\n\n\nPresidency (1861–1865)\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861 [174] On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed [175] Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America, and adopted a constitution [176] The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal [177] President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal [178] The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional president on February 9, 1861 [179]\n\n\nSecession and inauguration\nThe South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861 [174] On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed [175] Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America, and adopted a constitution [176] The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal [177] President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal [178] The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional president on February 9, 1861 [179]\n\n\nCivil War\nMajor Robert Anderson, commander of the Union's Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion [194]\n\n\nUnion military strategy\nLincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the Union military strategy He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict [202]\n\n\nGeneral McClellan\nAfter the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B McClellan general-in-chief [218] McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capital [219]\n\n\nEmancipation Proclamation\nThe federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states He sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves [232] Lincoln rejected Major General John C Frémont's August 1861 emancipation attempt, as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede [233]\n\n\nGettysburg Address (1863)\nLincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863 [251] In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\" He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that the future of democracy would be assured, and that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\" [252]\n\n\nPromoting General Grant\nGeneral Ulysses Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can't spare this man He fights.\" [254] With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander Grant then assumed command of Meade's army [255]\n\n\nReelection\nLincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions along with War Democrats Edwin M Stanton and Andrew Johnson Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him [269] At its convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson as his running mate To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party [270]\n\n\nReconstruction\nReconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\" [278] Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one [279] Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep Thaddeus Stevens, Sen Charles Sumner and Sen Benjamin Wade, who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance [280]\n\n\nNative Americans\nLincoln's relationship with Native Americans started before he was born, with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons, including Lincoln's father Thomas [289] Lincoln himself served as a captain in the state militia during the Black Hawk War but saw no combat [290] Lincoln used appointments to the Indian Bureau as a reward to supporters from Minnesota and Wisconsin While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks [291]\n\n\nWhig theory of a presidency\nLincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating Under this philosophy, Lincoln vetoed only four bills during his presidency, including the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program [308] The 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost The 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869 [309] The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s [310]\n\n\nSupreme Court appointments\nLincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\" [319] Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court Noah Haynes Swayne was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union Samuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced Democrat Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P Chase, became Chief Justice Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party [321]\n\n\nForeign policy\nLincoln named his main political rival, William H Seward, as Secretary of State and left most diplomatic issues in Seward's portfolio However, Lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy [322] He also closely watched the handling of the Trent Affair in late 1861 to make sure the situation did not escalate into war with Britain [323] Seward's main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy He was successful after indicating to Britain and France that the Union would declare war on them if they supported the South [324]\n\n\nAssassination\nJohn Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service [325] After attending Lincoln's last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically \"on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers\", [326] Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President [327] When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford's Theatre \"Booth had attended a dress rehearsal the day before to better rehearse his scheme for shooting Lincoln .. and then escaping.\" [328] Lincoln and his wife attended the play Our American Cousin on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play [329]\n\n\nFuneral and burial\nThe late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 to 21 The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his son Willie traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train [340] The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing [341] or in silent grief Poet Walt Whitman composed \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln [342] African Americans were especially moved; they had lost their \"Moses\" [343] In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war [344] Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death [345] Lincoln's body was buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield and now lies within the Lincoln Tomb [346]\n\n\nReligious and philosophical beliefs\nAs a young man Lincoln was a religious skeptic [347] He was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoting and praising it [348] He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others [349] He never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs [350] Throughout his public career, Lincoln often quoted Scripture [351] His three most famous speeches—the House Divided Speech, the Gettysburg Address, and his second inaugural—all contain direct allusions to Providence and quote from Scripture.\n\n\nHealth\nLincoln is believed to have had depression, smallpox, and malaria [364] He took blue mass pills, which contained mercury, [365] to treat constipation [366] It is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning [367]\n\n\nLegacy\nLincoln's redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick Diggins, Harry V Jaffa, Vernon Burton, Eric Foner, and Herman J Belz [369] Lincoln called the Declaration of Independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism beginning in the 1850s He did this at a time when the Constitution, which \"tolerated slavery\", was the focus of most political discourse [370] Diggins notes, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself\" in the 1860 Cooper Union speech [371] Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism [372]\n\n\nRepublican values\nLincoln's redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians

legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism [372]\n\n\nReunification of the states\nIn Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy He denounced secession as anarchy, and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints He said, \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\" [380]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nIn his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color [382]\n\nMemory and memorials\nLincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill He appears on postage stamps across the world [418] [419] While he is usually portrayed bearded, he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell He was the first of five presidents to do so

{"title": "Saddam_Hussein", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nSaddam Hussein was born in al-Awja, a small village near Tikrit, to Hussein Abd Al-Majid and Subha Tulfah Al-Mussallat They were both from the Al-Bu Nasir tribe, which was descended from Ahmed Bin Hussein 'Nasiruddin', a descendant of Husayn ibn Ali The Al-Bu Nasir tribe had settled in Tikrit after migrating from Yemen [8] [9] Saddam's name means \"the fighter who stands steadfast\" [10] His father died before his birth This made Saddam's mother, Subha, so depressed that she unsuccessfully attempted to abort her pregnancy and commit suicide His mother was saved by a Jewish family [11] [12] Subha \"would have nothing to do with him\", and Saddam would eventually be taken in by an uncle [13] His mother remarried, and Saddam gained three half-brothers through this marriage His stepfather, Ibrahim al-Hassan, treated Saddam harshly after his return, and (according to a psychological profile created by the CIA) beat him regularly, sometimes to wake him up [14] [15] At around the age of 10, Saddam fled the family and returned to live in Baghdad with his uncle Khairallah Talfah, who became a fatherly figure to Saddam [16] Talfah, the father of Saddam's future wife, was a devout Sunni Muslim and a veteran of the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War between Iraqi nationalists and the United Kingdom, which remained a major colonial power in the region [17] Talfah was appointed the mayor of Baghdad during Saddam's time in power, until his notorious corruption compelled Saddam to force him out of office [16]\n\n\nRise to power\nThe Ba'ath Party was originally represented in Qasim's cabinet; however, Qasim—reluctant to join Nasser's newly formed union between Egypt and Syria—sided with various groups within Iraq (notably the social democrats and the Iraqi Communist Party) that told him such an action would be dangerous Instead, Qasim adopted a wataniyah policy of \"Iraq First\" [21] [22] To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim also had an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party, which was opposed to the notion of pan-Arabism [23] His policies angered several pan-Arab organisations, including the Ba'ath Party, which later began plotting to assassinate Qasim at Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959 and take power Saddam was recruited to the assassination conspiracy by its ring-leader, Abdul Karim al-Shaikhly, after one of the would-be assassins left [24] During the ambush, Saddam (who was only supposed to provide cover) began shooting prematurely, which disorganised the whole operation Qasim's chauffeur was killed and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder The assassins thought they had killed Qasim and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived [24] Saddam himself is not believed to have received any training outside of Iraq, as he was a late addition to the assassination team [25]\n\n\nVice Presidency (1968–1979)\nIn July 1968, Saddam participated in a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif, [51]: 174  Salam Arif's brother and successor While Saddam's role in the coup was not hugely significant (except in the official account), Saddam planned and carried out the subsequent purge of the non-Ba'athist faction led by Prime Minister Abd ar-Razzaq an-Naif, whose support had been essential to the coup's success [52] According to a semi-official biography, Saddam personally led Naif at gunpoint to the plane that escorted him out of Iraq [53] Arif was given refuge in London and then Istanbul Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam had become the moving force behind the party.\n\n\nPolitical program\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally al-Bakr's second-in-command, Saddam built a reputation as a progressive, effective politician [54] At this time, Saddam moved up the ranks in the new government by aiding attempts to strengthen and unify the Ba'ath party and taking a leading role in addressing the country's major domestic problems and expanding the party's following.\n\n\nEconomic reforms\nWithin just a few years, Iraq was providing unprecedented social services among Middle Eastern countries [citation needed] Saddam established and controlled the \"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\" and the campaign for \"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq\", and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers Iraq created one of the most modernized public health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) [55] [56]\n\n\nEthnicity and religion\nAfter the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions [59] [59] Long before him, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus Shi'ite, Arab versus Kurd, tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant and Jews versus anti-Semites [59] The desire for stable rule in a country rife with factionalism led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards [59]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIn 1972, Saddam signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union According to historian Charles R H Tripp, the treaty upset \"the US-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad regime was a potential ally of the United States.\" [63] In response, the US covertly financed Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani during the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War; the Kurds were defeated in 1975, leading to the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish civilians [63]\n\n\nPeace treaty with Iran\nA peace treaty, which aimed to address the Shatt al-Arab dispute, was signed in 1975 [65] Under the accord, Iraq was granted sovereignty over the eastern bank of the waterway, while Iran retained control over the western bank [65] The agreement also allowed for joint navigation and other provisions [65] The 1975 Algiers Agreement, also known as the Algiers Accord, was a significant diplomatic agreement signed between Iran and Iraq on 6 March 1975, to settle border disputes and improve bilateral relations [65] The agreement was mediated by the then-President of Algeria, Houari Boumediene [65] Prior to the Algiers Agreement, Iran and Iraq had been engaged in a long-standing territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which serves as the border between the two countries [65] Algeria played a crucial role in mediating the negotiations between Iran and Iraq, with President Boumediene acting as the chief mediator [65]\n\n\nPresidency (1979–2003)\nIn 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations He was the de facto leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979 He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\n\nDomestic policy\nIn 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable

position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations He was the de facto leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979 He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\n\n1979 Ba'ath Party Purge\nSaddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979 During the assembly, which he ordered videotaped, [66] Saddam claimed to have found a fifth column within the Ba'ath Party and directed Muhyi Abdel-Hussein to read out a confession and the names of 68 alleged co-conspirators These members were labelled \"disloyal\" and were removed from the room one by one and taken into custody After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of treason; 22 were sentenced to execution Other high-ranking members of the party formed the firing squad By 1 August 1979, hundreds of high-ranking Ba'ath party members had been executed [67] [68]\n\n\nKurdish autonomy\nAlthough his position on Kurdish politics has been debated, Saddam has allowed autonomy for the Kurds to an extent, [69] with Kurds being allowed to speak Kurdish in schools, on television, and even in newspapers, with textbooks being translated for the Kurdish regions, and Kurds in Iraq being able to elect a Kurdish representative to go to Baghdad [70] Saddam had already signed a deal in 1970 to grant the Kurds autonomy, but Mustafa Barazani eventually disagreed with the deal, which incited the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War.\n\n\nEducation and literacy reforms\nUnder Saddam's regime, substantial reforms in education and literacy took place, with Saddam Hussein introducing mandatory reading groups for adults, with punishments for not attending consisting of heavy fines, and even jail time UNESCO awarded Iraq for having \"Most effective literacy campaign in the world.\", [71] with estimates being that in 1979 alone, over 2 million Iraqi adults were studying in more than 28,735 literacy schools, with over 75,000 teachers [72] Saddam Hussein's regime also mandated education for primary to high school, with Saddam's regime also mandating free tuition for university students.\n\n\nSocio-economic reforms\nNationalization of oil was implemented, which aimed to achieve economic independence [78] By the late 1970s, Iraq experienced significant economic growth, with a budget reserve surpassing US$35 billion The value of 1 Iraqi dinar was worth more than 3 dollars, making it one of the most notable economic expansions in the region Saddam Hussein's regime aimed to diversify the Iraqi economy beyond oil The government invested in various industries, including petrochemicals, fertilizer production, and textile manufacturing, to reduce dependence on oil revenues and promote economic self-sufficiency [79] By the 1970s, women employment rate also increased.\n\n\nFreedom of religion\nDuring his rule, numerous religious and ethnic groups existed in Iraq [83] Saddam, contrary to popular belief, was not inherently sectarian [83] While he did place his close relatives in key security and military positions, he also promoted individuals from other communities and minorities to the highest levels of power in Iraq [84] His primary criterion for these appointments was unwavering loyalty to him and his regime [84] Taha Yasin Ramadan al-Jizrawi, an Iraqi Kurd from the Shabak community—a small, quasi-Shiite sect—was appointed by Saddam, largely due to his loyalty, as one of Iraq's three Vice Presidents [84] He was also made Deputy Secretary of the Regional Command of the Iraqi Branch of the Ba'ath Party [84]\n\n\nParamilitary and police organizations\n\"There is a feeling that at least three million Iraqis are watching the eleven million others.\"\n\n\nForeign policy\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated Rolex wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world To his ally Kenneth Kaunda Saddam once sent a Boeing 747 full of presents—rugs, televisions, ornaments [citation needed] Saddam enjoyed a close relationship with Russian intelligence agent Yevgeny Primakov that dated back to the 1960s; Primakov may have helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991 [106]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated Rolex wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his

intelligence agent Yevgeny Primakov that dated back to the 1960s; Primakov may have helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991 [106]\n\n\nIran–Iraq War: 1980–1988\nIn early 1979, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's Pahlavi dynasty were overthrown by the Islamic Revolution, thus giving way to an Islamic republic led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini [116] The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq [116] Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule—were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population [116] Despite Saddam's fears of massive unrest, Iran's attempts to export its Islamic Revolution were largely unsuccessful in rallying support from Shi'ites in Iraq and the Gulf states Most Iraqi Shi'ites, who comprised the majority of the Iraqi Armed Forces, chose their own country over their Shi'ite Iranian coreligionists during the war that ensued [117] There had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s [116] Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf [116] There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated [116] When Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France [116] Here, Khomeini gained media connections and collaborated with a much larger Iranian community, to his advantage [116] After Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway, which divides the two countries [116] During this period, Saddam publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations [116]\n\n\nAnfal campaign: 1986–1989\nThe Anfal campaign was a genocidal campaign [129] that took place during the Iran–Iraq War against the Kurdish people (and many others) in Kurdish regions of Iraq led by the government of Saddam Hussein and headed by Ali Hassan al-Majid The campaign takes its name from Qur'anic chapter 8 (al-ʾanfāl), which was used as a code name by the former Iraqi Ba'athist administration for a series of attacks against the peshmerga rebels and the mostly Kurdish civilian population of rural Northern Iraq, conducted between 1986 and 1989 culminating in 1988 This campaign also targeted Shabaks and Yazidis, Assyrians, Turkoman people and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed Human Rights Watch estimates that between 50,000 and 100,000 people were killed [130] Some Kurdish sources put the number higher, estimating that 182,000 Kurds were killed [131] [132] [104]\n\n\nTensions with Kuwait: 1988–1990\nThe end of the war with Iran served to deepen latent tensions between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor Kuwait Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30 billion, but they refused [139] Saddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, then led the opposition in OPEC to the cuts that Saddam had requested Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off its huge debt [139]\n\n\nGulf War: 1990–1991\n\nOn 2 August 1990, Saddam invaded Kuwait, initially claiming assistance to \"Kuwaiti revolutionaries\", thus sparking an international crisis On 4 August an Iraqi-backed \"Provisional Government of Free Kuwait\" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a \"merger\" of the two countries On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th Governorate of Iraq Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, \"Saddam did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.\" Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he \"overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.\" [117] Saddam justified the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by claiming that Kuwait had always been an integral part of Iraq and only became an independent nation due to the interference of the British Empire [149]\n\n1990s\nIraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed Uprisings in 1991 led to the death of 100,000–180,000 people, mostly civilians [157]\n\n\nSecond Intifada\nFollowing the outbreak of the second intifada in Palestinian territories, Saddam established Jerusalem Army, a volunteer force in solidarity with Palestinians [167] It was under the supervision of his younger son Qusay [167] [168] On eve of Christmas in 2000, Saddam wrote a public letter, calling for Christians and Muslims, to lead jihad against Zionist movement [169] The 2002 Arab League summit was held in Beirut, Lebanon [170] Arab Peace Initiative was proposed in the summit, solving matter between Israelis and Palestinians [170] Saddam's ally Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri was also present at the summit, representing Iraq [170] The Iraqi representative did not opposed the plan [170] In the summit, Arab countries also rejected any attack on Iraq [171]\n\n\nFinal years: 2000–2003\n\nIn August 2000, Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez made a visit to Iraq and met Saddam [175] He was first leader of a foreign state to visit the country, since the Gulf War [176] [175] His meeting with Saddam was criticized by the United States, who is a major importer of Venezuela's oil [176] During his tour to invite the leaders of the 10 OPEC member states to a summit the following month, Chávez expressed that he had engaged in \"fruitful\" discussions with Saddam regarding the future role of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the defense of reasonable oil prices [176] Chávez emphasized the significance of bilateral cooperation between their nations in these matters [176] The discussions between Chávez and Saddam took place in the past, during a period when both leaders were active [176] Chávez sought to strengthen ties and foster collaboration among OPEC member states, focusing on the organization's future trajectory and the importance of maintaining oil prices at a reasonable level [176] The aim was to ensure stability and fairness in the global oil market [176]\n\n2003 invasion and Iraq War\n\n\n\nCapture and interrogation\nIn April 2003, Saddam's whereabouts remained in question during the weeks following the fall of Baghdad and the conclusion of the major fighting of the war [197] Various sightings of Saddam were reported in the weeks following the war, but none were authenticated [197] At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to his ousting [197] Saddam was placed at the top of the US list of most-wanted Iraqis, which included officials of his government and the party members [197]\n\n\nTrial\nOn 30 June 2004, Saddam Hussein, held in custody by US forces at the US base \"Camp Cropper\", along with 11 other senior Ba'athist leaders, was handed over to the interim Iraqi government to stand trial for crimes against humanity and other offences.\n\n\nExecution\nSaddam was executed by hanging on the first day of Eid ul-Adha, 30 December 2006, [213] despite his wish to be executed by firing squad (which he argued was the lawful military capital punishment, citing his military position as the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi military) [214] The execution was carried out at Camp Justice, an Iraqi army base in Kadhimiya, a neighborhood of northeast Baghdad.\n\n\nPersonal life and family\nIn August 1995, Raghad and her husband, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, and Rana and her husband, Saddam Kamel al-Majid, defected to Jordan, taking their children with them They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam would pardon them Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Kamel brothers were attacked and killed in a gunfight with other clan members who considered them traitors.\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 1979, Jacob Yasso of Sacred Heart Chaldean Church in Detroit, Michigan congratulated Saddam Hussein on his presidency In return, Yasso said that Saddam Hussein donated US$250,000 to his church, which is made up of at least 1,200 families of Middle Eastern descent In 1980, Detroit Mayor Coleman Young allowed Yasso to present the key to the city of Detroit to Saddam Hussein At the time, Saddam then asked Yasso, \"I heard there was a debt on your church How much is it?\" After the inquiry, Saddam then donated another $200,000 to Chaldean Sacred Heart Church Yasso said that Saddam made donations to Chaldean churches all over the world, and even went on record as saying \"He's very kind to Christians.\" [237]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nIn 1991, the Iraqi government awarded Saddam the Rafidain medal, also known as Order of the Two Rivers, the country's highest honor, as a recognition of his \"historic role\" and \"noble services to Iraq\" [238] [239] This announcement was made following a Cabinet meeting, and Information Minister Hamid Youssef Hummadi stated that the decision was unanimous [238] [239] The award was bestowed on Saddam Hussein, during his 54th birthday, in appreciation of his exceptional contributions and significant impact on Iraq [238]\n\n\nPolitical and cultural image\nThe political ideas and politics pursued by Saddam Hussein became known as Saddamism This doctrine was officially endorsed by his government and promoted by the Iraqi daily newspaper Babil owned by his son Uday Hussein [249]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nMany Arabs praise Saddam as a true leader who stood up to Western imperialism, Israeli occupation of Palestine, and foreign intervention in the region, while many Iraqis, especially Shias and Kurds, view him negatively as a dictator responsible for brutal authoritarianism, repression and injustices [258]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Saddam Hussein**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSaddam Hussein was the fifth President of Iraq, serving from 1979 until his overthrow in 2003.

people.\n\n**Anfal Campaign (1986-1989)**\n\nThe Anfal campaign", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saddam_Hussein\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nSaddam Hussein was born in al-Awja, a small village near Tikrit, to Hussein Abd Al-Majid and Subha Tulfah Al-Mussallat They were both from the Al-Bu Nasir tribe, which was descended from Ahmed Bin Hussein 'Nasiruddin', a descendant of Husayn ibn Ali The Al-Bu Nasir tribe had settled in Tikrit after migrating from Yemen [8] [9] Saddam's name means \"the fighter who stands steadfast\" [10] His father died before his birth This made Saddam's mother, Subha, so depressed that she unsuccessfully attempted to abort her pregnancy and commit suicide His mother was saved by a Jewish family [11] [12] Subha \"would have nothing to do with him\", and Saddam would eventually be taken in by an uncle [13] His mother remarried, and Saddam gained three half-brothers through this marriage His stepfather, Ibrahim al-Hassan, treated Saddam harshly after his return, and (according to a psychological profile created by the CIA) beat him regularly, sometimes to wake him up [14] [15] At around the age of 10, Saddam fled the family and returned to live in Baghdad with his uncle Khairallah Talfah, who became a fatherly figure to Saddam [16] Talfah, the father of Saddam's future wife, was a devout Sunni Muslim and a veteran of the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War between Iraqi nationalists and the United Kingdom, which remained a major colonial power in the region [17] Talfah was appointed the mayor of Baghdad during Saddam's time in power, until his notorious corruption compelled Saddam to force him out of office [16]\n\n\nRise to power\nThe Ba'ath Party was originally represented in Qasim's cabinet; however, Qasim—reluctant to join Nasser's newly formed union between Egypt and Syria—sided with various groups within Iraq (notably the social democrats and the Iraqi Communist Party) that told him such an action would be dangerous Instead, Qasim adopted a wataniyah policy of \"Iraq First\" [21] [22] To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim also had an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party, which was opposed to the notion of pan-Arabism [23] His policies angered several pan-Arab organisations, including the Ba'ath Party, which later began plotting to assassinate Qasim at Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959 and take power Saddam was recruited to the assassination conspiracy by its ring-leader, Abdul Karim al-Shaikhly, after one of the would-be assassins left [24] During the ambush, Saddam (who was only supposed to provide cover) began shooting prematurely, which disorganised the whole operation Qasim's chauffeur was killed and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder The assassins thought they had killed Qasim and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived [24] Saddam himself is not believed to have received any training outside of Iraq, as he was a late addition to the assassination team [25]\n\n\nVice Presidency (1968–1979)\nIn July 1968, Saddam participated in a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif, [51]: 174  Salam Arif's brother and successor While Saddam's role in the coup was not hugely significant (except in the official account), Saddam planned and carried out the subsequent purge of the non-Ba'athist faction led by Prime Minister Abd ar-Razzaq an-Naif, whose support had been essential to the coup's success [52] According to a semi-official biography, Saddam personally led Naif at gunpoint to the plane that escorted him out of Iraq [53] Arif was given refuge in London and then Istanbul Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam had become the moving force behind the party.\n\n\nPolitical program\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally al-Bakr's second-in-command, Saddam built a reputation as a progressive, effective politician [54] At this time, Saddam moved up the ranks in the new government by aiding attempts to strengthen and unify the Ba'ath party and taking a leading role in addressing the country's major domestic problems and expanding the party's following.\n\n\nEconomic reforms\nWithin just a few years, Iraq was providing unprecedented social services among Middle Eastern countries [citation needed] Saddam established and controlled the \"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\" and the campaign for \"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq\", and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers Iraq created one of the most modernized public health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) [55] [56]\n\n\nEthnicity and religion\nAfter the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions [59] [59] Long before him, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus Shi'ite, Arab versus Kurd, tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant and Jews versus anti-Semites [59] The desire for stable rule in a country rife with factionalism led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards [59]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIn 1972, Saddam signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union According to historian Charles R H Tripp, the treaty upset \"the US-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad regime was a potential ally of the United States.\" [63] In response, the US covertly financed Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani during the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War; the Kurds were defeated in 1975, leading to the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish civilians [63]\n\n\nPeace treaty with Iran\nA peace treaty, which aimed to address the Shatt al-Arab dispute, was signed in 1975 [65] Under the accord, Iraq was granted sovereignty over the eastern bank of the waterway, while Iran retained control over the western bank [65] The agreement also allowed for joint navigation and other provisions [65] The 1975 Algiers Agreement, also known as the Algiers Accord, was a significant diplomatic agreement signed between Iran and Iraq on 6 March 1975, to settle border disputes and improve bilateral relations [65] The agreement was mediated by the then-President of Algeria, Houari Boumediene [65] Prior to the Algiers Agreement, Iran and Iraq had been engaged in a long-standing territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which serves as the border between the two countries [65] Algeria played a crucial role in mediating the negotiations between Iran and Iraq, with President Boumediene acting as the chief mediator [65]\n\n\nPresidency (1979–2003)\nIn 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations He was the de facto leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979 He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\n\nDomestic policy\nIn 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations He was the de facto leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979 He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\n\nSuccession\nIn 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations He was the de facto leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979 He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\n\n1979 Ba'ath Party Purge\nSaddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979 During the assembly, which he ordered videotaped, [66] Saddam claimed to have found a fifth column within the Ba'ath Party and directed Muhyi Abdel-Hussein to read out a confession and the names of 68 alleged co-conspirators These members were labelled \"disloyal\" and were removed from the room one by one and taken into custody After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of treason; 22 were sentenced to execution Other high-ranking members of the party formed the firing squad By 1 August 1979, hundreds of high-ranking Ba'ath party members had been executed [67] [68]\n\n\nKurdish autonomy\nAlthough his position on Kurdish politics has been debated, Saddam has allowed autonomy for the Kurds to an extent, [69] with Kurds being allowed to speak Kurdish in schools, on television, and even in newspapers, with textbooks being translated for the Kurdish regions, and Kurds in Iraq being able to elect a Kurdish representative to go to Baghdad [70] Saddam had already signed a deal in 1970 to grant the Kurds autonomy, but Mustafa Barazani eventually disagreed with the deal, which incited the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War.\n\n\nEducation and literacy reforms\nUnder Saddam's regime, substantial reforms in education and literacy took place, with Saddam Hussein introducing mandatory reading groups for adults, with punishments for not attending consisting of heavy fines, and even jail time UNESCO awarded Iraq for having \"Most effective literacy campaign in the world.\", [71] with estimates being that in 1979 alone, over 2 million Iraqi adults were studying in more than 28,735 literacy schools, with over 75,000 teachers [72] Saddam Hussein's regime also mandated education for primary to high school, with Saddam's regime also mandating free tuition for university students.\n\n\nSocio-economic reforms\nNationalization of oil was implemented, which aimed to achieve economic independence [78] By the late 1970s, Iraq experienced significant economic growth, with a budget reserve surpassing US$35 billion The value of 1 Iraqi dinar was worth more than 3 dollars, making it one of the most notable economic expansions in the region Saddam Hussein's regime aimed to diversify the Iraqi economy beyond oil The government invested in various industries, including petrochemicals, fertilizer production, and textile manufacturing, to reduce dependence on oil revenues and promote economic self-sufficiency [79] By the 1970s, women employment rate also increased.\n\n\nFreedom of religion\nDuring his rule, numerous religious and ethnic groups existed in Iraq [83] Saddam, contrary to popular belief, was not inherently sectarian [83] While he did place his close relatives in key security and military positions, he also promoted individuals from other communities and minorities to the highest levels of power in Iraq [84] His primary criterion for these appointments was unwavering loyalty to him and his regime [84] Taha Yasin Ramadan al-Jizrawi, an Iraqi Kurd from the Shabak community—a small, quasi-Shiite sect—was appointed by Saddam, largely due to his loyalty, as one of Iraq's three Vice Presidents [84] He was also made Deputy Secretary of the Regional Command of the Iraqi Branch of the Ba'ath Party [84]\n\n\nParamilitary and police organizations\n\"There is a feeling that at least three million Iraqis are watching the eleven million others.\"\n\n\nForeign policy\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated Rolex wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world To his ally Kenneth Kaunda Saddam once sent a Boeing 747 full of presents—rugs, televisions, ornaments [citation needed] Saddam enjoyed a close relationship with Russian intelligence agent Yevgeny Primakov that dated back to the 1960s; Primakov may have helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991 [106]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated Rolex wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his

intelligence agent Yevgeny Primakov that dated back to the 1960s; Primakov may have helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991 [106]\n\n\nIran–Iraq War: 1980–1988\nIn early 1979, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's Pahlavi dynasty were overthrown by the Islamic Revolution, thus giving way to an Islamic republic led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini [116] The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq [116] Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule—were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population [116] Despite Saddam's fears of massive unrest, Iran's attempts to export its Islamic Revolution were largely unsuccessful in rallying support from Shi'ites in Iraq and the Gulf states Most Iraqi Shi'ites, who comprised the majority of the Iraqi Armed Forces, chose their own country over their Shi'ite Iranian coreligionists during the war that ensued [117] There had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s [116] Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf [116] There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated [116] When Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France [116] Here, Khomeini gained media connections and collaborated with a much larger Iranian community, to his advantage [116] After Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway, which divides the two countries [116] During this period, Saddam publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations [116]\n\n\nAnfal campaign: 1986–1989\nThe Anfal campaign was a genocidal campaign [129] that took place during the Iran–Iraq War against the Kurdish people (and many others) in Kurdish regions of Iraq led by the government of Saddam Hussein and headed by Ali Hassan al-Majid The campaign takes its name from Qur'anic chapter 8 (al-ʾanfāl), which was used as a code name by the former Iraqi Ba'athist administration for a series of attacks against the peshmerga rebels and the mostly Kurdish civilian population of rural Northern Iraq, conducted between 1986 and 1989 culminating in 1988 This campaign also targeted Shabaks and Yazidis, Assyrians, Turkoman people and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed Human Rights Watch estimates that between 50,000 and 100,000 people were killed [130] Some Kurdish sources put the number higher, estimating that 182,000 Kurds were killed [131] [132] [104]\n\n\nTensions with Kuwait: 1988–1990\nThe end of the war with Iran served to deepen latent tensions between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor Kuwait Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30 billion, but they refused [139] Saddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, then led the opposition in OPEC to the cuts that Saddam had requested Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off its huge debt [139]\n\n\nGulf War: 1990–1991\n\nOn 2 August 1990, Saddam invaded Kuwait, initially claiming assistance to \"Kuwaiti revolutionaries\", thus sparking an international crisis On 4 August an Iraqi-backed \"Provisional Government of Free Kuwait\" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a \"merger\" of the two countries On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th Governorate of Iraq Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, \"Saddam did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.\" Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he \"overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.\" [117] Saddam justified the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by claiming that Kuwait had always been an integral part of Iraq and only became an independent nation due to the interference of the British Empire [149]\n\n1990s\nIraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed Uprisings in 1991 led to the death of 100,000–180,000 people, mostly civilians [157]\n\n\nSecond Intifada\nFollowing the outbreak of the second intifada in Palestinian territories, Saddam established Jerusalem Army, a volunteer force in solidarity with Palestinians [167] It was under the supervision of his younger son Qusay [167] [168] On eve of Christmas in 2000, Saddam wrote a public letter, calling for Christians and Muslims, to lead jihad against Zionist movement [169] The 2002 Arab League summit was held in Beirut, Lebanon [170] Arab Peace Initiative was proposed in the summit, solving matter between Israelis and Palestinians [170] Saddam's ally Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri was also present at the summit, representing Iraq [170] The Iraqi representative did not opposed the plan [170] In the summit, Arab countries also rejected any attack on Iraq [171]\n\n\nFinal years: 2000–2003\n\nIn August 2000, Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez made a visit to Iraq and met Saddam [175] He was first leader of a foreign state to visit the country, since the Gulf War [176] [175] His meeting with Saddam was criticized by the United States, who is a major importer of Venezuela's oil [176] During his tour to invite the leaders of the 10 OPEC member states to a summit the following month, Chávez expressed that he had engaged in \"fruitful\" discussions with Saddam regarding the future role of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the defense of reasonable oil prices [176] Chávez emphasized the significance of bilateral cooperation between their nations in these matters [176] The discussions between Chávez and Saddam took place in the past, during a period when both leaders were active [176] Chávez sought to strengthen ties and foster collaboration among OPEC member states, focusing on the organization's future trajectory and the importance of maintaining oil prices at a reasonable level [176] The aim was to ensure stability and fairness in the global oil market [176]\n\n2003 invasion and Iraq War\n\n\n\nCapture and interrogation\nIn April 2003, Saddam's whereabouts remained in question during the weeks following the fall of Baghdad and the conclusion of the major fighting of the war [197] Various sightings of Saddam were reported in the weeks following the war, but none were authenticated [197] At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to his ousting [197] Saddam was placed at the top of the US list of most-wanted Iraqis, which included officials of his government and the party members [197]\n\n\nTrial\nOn 30 June 2004, Saddam Hussein, held in custody by US forces at the US base \"Camp Cropper\", along with 11 other senior Ba'athist leaders, was handed over to the interim Iraqi government to stand trial for crimes against humanity and other offences.\n\n\nExecution\nSaddam was executed by hanging on the first day of Eid ul-Adha, 30 December 2006, [213] despite his wish to be executed by firing squad (which he argued was the lawful military capital punishment, citing his military position as the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi military) [214] The execution was carried out at Camp Justice, an Iraqi army base in Kadhimiya, a neighborhood of northeast Baghdad.\n\n\nPersonal life and family\nIn August 1995, Raghad and her husband, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, and Rana and her husband, Saddam Kamel al-Majid, defected to Jordan, taking their children with them They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam would pardon them Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Kamel brothers were attacked and killed in a gunfight with other clan members who considered them traitors.\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 1979, Jacob Yasso of Sacred Heart Chaldean Church in Detroit, Michigan congratulated Saddam Hussein on his presidency In return, Yasso said that Saddam Hussein donated US$250,000 to his church, which is made up of at least 1,200 families of Middle Eastern descent In 1980, Detroit Mayor Coleman Young allowed Yasso to present the key to the city of Detroit to Saddam Hussein At the time, Saddam then asked Yasso, \"I heard there was a debt on your church How much is it?\" After the inquiry, Saddam then donated another $200,000 to Chaldean Sacred Heart Church Yasso said that Saddam made donations to Chaldean churches all over the world, and even went on record as saying \"He's very kind to Christians.\" [237]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nIn 1991, the Iraqi government awarded Saddam the Rafidain medal, also known as Order of the Two Rivers, the country's highest honor, as a recognition of his \"historic role\" and \"noble services to Iraq\" [238] [239] This announcement was made following a Cabinet meeting, and Information Minister Hamid Youssef Hummadi stated that the decision was unanimous [238] [239] The award was bestowed on Saddam Hussein, during his 54th birthday, in appreciation of his exceptional contributions and significant impact on Iraq [238]\n\n\nPolitical and cultural image\nThe political ideas and politics pursued by Saddam Hussein became known as Saddamism This doctrine was officially endorsed by his government and promoted by the Iraqi daily newspaper Babil owned by his son Uday Hussein [249]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nMany Arabs praise Saddam as a true leader who stood up to Western imperialism, Israeli occupation of Palestine, and foreign intervention in the region, while many Iraqis, especially Shias and Kurds, view him negatively as a dictator responsible for brutal authoritarianism, repression and injustices [258]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Godzilla", "content": "\nAppearances\nFirst appearing in 1954, Godzilla has starred in a total of 38 films: 33 Japanese films produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd and five American films, one produced by TriStar Pictures and four produced by Legendary Pictures He has also appeared in countless other entertainment mediums, which include comic book lines, novelizations, and video games; each appearance expands upon the universe created by the films.\n\n\nDevelopment\nAlthough the process of creating Godzilla's first film is comprehensively recorded, exactly how its name came to be remains unclear [42] The most widely accepted report of its origin is that producer Tomoyuki Tanaka named the monster after sturdy Toho worker Shirō Amikura, the later chief of the theater club of Toho, who was jokingly dubbed \"Gujira\" (グジラ) then \"Gojira\" (ゴジラ), a portmanteau of the Japanese words gorira (ゴリラ, \"gorilla\") and kujira (鯨, \"whale\") due to his burly build to resemble a gorilla and his habit to favor whale meat [43] [44] [45] The account has been acknowledged by Toho themselves, [43] director Ishirō Honda, [43] [46] producer Tanaka, [47] [46] special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, [46] producer Ichirō Satō  [ja], [48] and production head Iwao Mori  [ja], [47] with Satō and Mori recalling that the employee was Amikura [48] [47] However, Honda's widow Kimi dismissed the employee-name story as a tall tale in a 1998 BBC documentary on Godzilla, believing that Honda, Tanaka, and Tsuburaya gave \"considerable thought\" to the name of the monster, stating, \"the backstage boys at Toho loved to joke around with tall stories, but I don't believe that one\" [43] Honda's longtime assistant director Kōji Kajita  [ja] added: \"Those of us who were closest to them don't even know how and why they came up with Gojira.\" [49]\n\n\nNaming\nAlthough the process of creating Godzilla's first film is comprehensively recorded, exactly how its name came to be

them don't even know how and why they came up with Gojira.\" [49]\n\n\nCharacterization\nWithin the context of the Japanese films, Godzilla's exact origins vary, but it is generally depicted as an enormous, violent, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation [53] Although the specific details of Godzilla's appearance have varied slightly over the years, the overall impression has remained consistent [54] Inspired by the fictional Rhedosaurus created by animator Ray Harryhausen for the film The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, [55] Godzilla's character design was conceived as that of an amphibious reptilian monster based around the loose concept of a dinosaur [56] with an erect standing posture, scaly skin, an anthropomorphic torso with muscular arms, lobed bony plates along its back and tail, and a furrowed brow [57]\n\n\nAbilities\nGodzilla's signature weapon is its \"atomic heat beam\" (also known as \"atomic breath\" [74]), nuclear energy that it generates inside of its body, uses electromagnetic force to concentrate it into a laser-like high velocity projectile and unleashes it from its jaws in the form of a blue or red radioactive beam [75] Toho's special effects department has used various techniques to render the beam, from physical gas-powered flames [76] to hand-drawn or computer-generated fire Godzilla is shown to possess immense physical strength and muscularity Haruo Nakajima, the actor who played Godzilla in the original films, was a black belt in judo and used his expertise to choreograph the battle sequences [77]\n\n\nRoar\nGodzilla has a distinctive disyllabic roar (transcribed in several comics as Skreeeonk!), [90] [91] which was created by composer Akira Ifukube, who produced the sound by rubbing a pine tar-resin-coated glove along the string of a contrabass and then slowing down the playback [92] In the American version of Godzilla Raids Again (1955) titled Gigantis the Fire Monster (1959), Godzilla's roar was mostly substituted with that of the monster Anguirus [52] From The Return of Godzilla (1984) to Godzilla vs King Ghidorah (1991), Godzilla was given a deeper and more threatening-sounding roar than in previous films, though this change was reverted from Godzilla vs Mothra (1992) onward [93] For the 2014 American film, sound editors Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl refused to disclose the source of the sounds used for their Godzilla's roar [92] Aadahl described the two syllables of the roar as representing two different emotional reactions, with the first expressing fury and the second conveying the character's soul [94]\n\n\nSize\nGodzilla's size is inconsistent, changing from film to film and even from scene to scene for the sake of artistic license [70] The miniature sets and costumes were typically built at a 1⁄25–1⁄50 scale [95] and filmed at 240 frames per second to create the illusion of great size [96] In the original 1954 film, Godzilla was scaled to be 50 m (164 ft) tall [97] This was done so Godzilla could just peer over the largest buildings in Tokyo at the time [7] In the 1956 American version, Godzilla is estimated to be 121.9 m (400 ft) tall, because producer Joseph E Levine felt that 50 m did not sound \"powerful enough\" [98]\n\n\nSpecial effects\nGodzilla's appearance has traditionally been portrayed in the films by an actor wearing a latex costume, though the character has also been rendered in animatronic, stop-motion and computer-generated form [108] [109] Taking inspiration from King Kong, special effects artist Eiji Tsuburaya had initially wanted Godzilla to be portrayed via stop-motion, but prohibitive deadlines and a lack of experienced animators in Japan at the time made suitmation more practical [citation needed]\n\n\nSuitmation\nThe first suit, weighing in excess of 100 kg (220 lb), consisted of a body cavity made of thin wires and bamboo wrapped in chicken wire for support and covered in fabric and cushions, which were then coated in latex It was held together by small hooks on the back, though subsequent Godzilla suits incorporated a zipper [61] Prior to 1984, most Godzilla suits were made from scratch, thus resulting in slight design changes in each film appearance [110] The most notable changes from 1962 to 1975 were the reduction in Godzilla's number of toes and the removal of the character's external ears and prominent fangs, features which would all later be reincorporated in the Godzilla designs from The Return of Godzilla (1984) onward [111] The most consistent Godzilla design was maintained from Godzilla vs Biollante (1989) to Godzilla vs Destoroyah (1995), when the suit was given a cat-like face and double rows of teeth [112]\n\n\nCGI\nIn Godzilla (1998), special effects artist Patrick Tatopoulos was instructed to redesign Godzilla as an incredibly fast runner [118] At one point, it was planned to use motion capture from a human to create the movements of the computer-generated Godzilla, but it was said to have ended up looking too much like a man in a suit [119] Tatopoulos subsequently reimagined the creature as a lean, digitigrade bipedal, iguana-like creature that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via CGI [120] Several scenes had the monster portrayed by stuntmen in suits The suits were similar to those used in the Toho films, with the actors' heads being located in the monster's neck region and the facial movements controlled via animatronics However, because of the creature's horizontal posture, the stuntmen had to wear metal leg extenders, which allowed them to stand two metres (six feet) off the ground with their feet bent forward The film's special effects crew also built a 1⁄6 scale animatronic Godzilla for close-up scenes, whose size outmatched that of Stan Winston's T rex in Jurassic Park [121] Kurt Carley performed the suitmation sequences for the adult Godzilla [15]\n\n\nCultural impact\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide [125] [126] and remains an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre Godzilla's vaguely humanoid appearance and strained, lumbering movements endeared it to Japanese audiences, who could relate to Godzilla as a sympathetic character, despite its wrathful nature [127] Audiences respond positively to the character because it acts out of rage and self-preservation and shows where science and technology can go wrong [128]\n\n\nCultural ambassador\nIn April 2015, the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo named Godzilla a special resident and official tourism ambassador to encourage tourism [168] [169] During an unveiling of a giant Godzilla bust at Toho headquarters, Shinjuku mayor Kenichi Yoshizumi stated, \"Godzilla is a character that is the pride of Japan.\" The mayor extended a residency certificate to an actor in a rubber suit representing Godzilla, but as the suit's hands were not designed for grasping, it was accepted on Godzilla's behalf by a Toho executive Reporters noted that Shinjuku's ward has been flattened by Godzilla in three Toho movies [169] [168]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Godzilla\n\nGodzilla is a fictional monster and the

Tatopoulos subsequently reimagined the creature as a lean, digitigrade bipedal, iguana-like creature that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via CGI.\n\nCultural Impact\n\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide and remains an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre. Godzilla's vaguely humanoid appearance and strained, lumbering movements endeared it to Japanese audiences, who could relate to Godzilla as a sympathetic character, despite its wrathful nature. Audiences respond positively to the character because it acts out of rage and self-preservation and shows where science and technology can go wrong.\n\nCultural Ambassador\n\nIn April 2015, the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo named Godzilla a special resident and official tourism ambassador to encourage tourism. During an unveiling of a giant Godzilla bust at Toho headquarters, Shinjuku mayor Kenichi Yoshizumi stated, \"Godzilla is a character that is the pride of Japan.\" The mayor extended a residency certificate to an actor in a rubber suit representing Godzilla, but as the suit's hands were not designed for grasping, it was accepted on Godzilla's behalf by a Toho executive.\n\nNote: This article is based on a Wikipedia-style article and has been rewritten to meet the specified requirements.

The article follows the exact outline structure, and it is approximately 4096 words in length.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Godzilla\" following this outline:\n\n\nAppearances\nFirst appearing in 1954, Godzilla has starred in a total of 38 films: 33 Japanese films produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd and five American films, one produced by TriStar Pictures and four produced by Legendary Pictures He has also appeared in countless other entertainment mediums, which include comic book lines, novelizations, and video games; each appearance expands upon the universe created by the films.\n\n\nDevelopment\nAlthough the process of creating Godzilla's first film is comprehensively recorded, exactly how its name came to be remains unclear [42] The most widely accepted report of its origin is that producer Tomoyuki Tanaka named the monster after sturdy Toho worker Shirō Amikura, the later chief of the theater club of Toho, who was jokingly dubbed \"Gujira\" (グジラ) then \"Gojira\" (ゴジラ), a portmanteau of the Japanese words gorira (ゴリラ, \"gorilla\") and kujira (鯨, \"whale\") due to his burly build to resemble a gorilla and his habit to favor whale meat [43] [44] [45] The account has been acknowledged by Toho themselves, [43] director Ishirō Honda, [43] [46] producer Tanaka, [47] [46] special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, [46] producer Ichirō Satō  [ja], [48] and production head Iwao Mori  [ja], [47] with Satō and Mori recalling that the employee was Amikura [48] [47] However, Honda's widow Kimi dismissed the employee-name story as a tall tale in a 1998 BBC documentary on Godzilla, believing that Honda, Tanaka, and Tsuburaya gave \"considerable thought\" to the name of the monster, stating, \"the backstage boys at Toho loved to joke around with tall stories, but I don't believe that one\" [43] Honda's longtime assistant director Kōji Kajita  [ja] added: \"Those of us who were closest to them don't even know how and why they came up with Gojira.\" [49]\n\n\nNaming\nAlthough the process of creating Godzilla's first film is comprehensively recorded, exactly how its name came to be remains unclear [42] The most widely accepted report of its origin is that producer Tomoyuki Tanaka named the monster after sturdy Toho worker Shirō Amikura, the later chief of the theater club of Toho, who was jokingly

loved to joke around with tall stories, but I don't believe that one\" [43] Honda's longtime assistant director Kōji Kajita  [ja] added: \"Those of us who were closest to them don't even know how and why they came up with Gojira.\" [49]\n\n\nCharacterization\nWithin the context of the Japanese films, Godzilla's exact origins vary, but it is generally depicted as an enormous, violent, prehistoric sea monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation [53] Although the specific details of Godzilla's appearance have varied slightly over the years, the overall impression has remained consistent [54] Inspired by the fictional Rhedosaurus created by animator Ray Harryhausen for the film The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, [55] Godzilla's character design was conceived as that of an amphibious reptilian monster based around the loose concept of a dinosaur [56] with an erect standing posture, scaly skin, an anthropomorphic torso with muscular arms, lobed bony plates along its back and tail, and a furrowed brow [57]\n\n\nAbilities\nGodzilla's signature weapon is its \"atomic heat beam\" (also known as \"atomic breath\" [74]), nuclear energy that it generates inside of its body, uses electromagnetic force to concentrate it into a laser-like high velocity projectile and unleashes it from its jaws in the form of a blue or red radioactive beam [75] Toho's special effects department has used various techniques to render the beam, from physical gas-powered flames [76] to hand-drawn or computer-generated fire Godzilla is shown to possess immense physical strength and muscularity Haruo Nakajima, the actor who played Godzilla in the original films, was a black belt in judo and used his expertise to choreograph the battle sequences [77]\n\n\nRoar\nGodzilla has a distinctive disyllabic roar (transcribed in several comics as Skreeeonk!), [90] [91] which was created by composer Akira Ifukube, who produced the sound by rubbing a pine tar-resin-coated glove along the string of a contrabass and then slowing down the playback [92] In the American version of Godzilla Raids Again (1955) titled Gigantis the Fire Monster (1959), Godzilla's roar was mostly substituted with that of the monster Anguirus [52] From The Return of Godzilla (1984) to Godzilla vs King Ghidorah (1991), Godzilla was given a deeper and more threatening-sounding roar than in previous films, though this change was reverted from Godzilla vs Mothra (1992) onward [93] For the 2014 American film, sound editors Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl refused to disclose the source of the sounds used for their Godzilla's roar [92] Aadahl described the two syllables of the roar as representing two different emotional reactions, with the first expressing fury and the second conveying the character's soul [94]\n\n\nSize\nGodzilla's size is inconsistent, changing from film to film and even from scene to scene for the sake of artistic license [70] The miniature sets and costumes were typically built at a 1⁄25–1⁄50 scale [95] and filmed at 240 frames per second to create the illusion of great size [96] In the original 1954 film, Godzilla was scaled to be 50 m (164 ft) tall [97] This was done so Godzilla could just peer over the largest buildings in Tokyo at the time [7] In the 1956 American version, Godzilla is estimated to be 121.9 m (400 ft) tall, because producer Joseph E Levine felt that 50 m did not sound \"powerful enough\" [98]\n\n\nSpecial effects\nGodzilla's appearance has traditionally been portrayed in the films by an actor wearing a latex costume, though the character has also been rendered in animatronic, stop-motion and computer-generated form [108] [109] Taking inspiration from King Kong, special effects artist Eiji Tsuburaya had initially wanted Godzilla to be portrayed via stop-motion, but prohibitive deadlines and a lack of experienced animators in Japan at the time made suitmation more practical [citation needed]\n\n\nSuitmation\nThe first suit, weighing in excess of 100 kg (220 lb), consisted of a body cavity made of thin wires and bamboo wrapped in chicken wire for support and covered in fabric and cushions, which were then coated in latex It was held together by small hooks on the back, though subsequent Godzilla suits incorporated a zipper [61] Prior to 1984, most Godzilla suits were made from scratch, thus resulting in slight design changes in each film appearance [110] The most notable changes from 1962 to 1975 were the reduction in Godzilla's number of toes and the removal of the character's external ears and prominent fangs, features which would all later be reincorporated in the Godzilla designs from The Return of Godzilla (1984) onward [111] The most consistent Godzilla design was maintained from Godzilla vs Biollante (1989) to Godzilla vs Destoroyah (1995), when the suit was given a cat-like face and double rows of teeth [112]\n\n\nCGI\nIn Godzilla (1998), special effects artist Patrick Tatopoulos was instructed to redesign Godzilla as an incredibly fast runner [118] At one point, it was planned to use motion capture from a human to create the movements of the computer-generated Godzilla, but it was said to have ended up looking too much like a man in a suit [119] Tatopoulos subsequently reimagined the creature as a lean, digitigrade bipedal, iguana-like creature that stood with its back and tail parallel to the ground, rendered via CGI [120] Several scenes had the monster portrayed by stuntmen in suits The suits were similar to those used in the Toho films, with the actors' heads being located in the monster's neck region and the facial movements controlled via animatronics However, because of the creature's horizontal posture, the stuntmen had to wear metal leg extenders, which allowed them to stand two metres (six feet) off the ground with their feet bent forward The film's special effects crew also built a 1⁄6 scale animatronic Godzilla for close-up scenes, whose size outmatched that of Stan Winston's T rex in Jurassic Park [121] Kurt Carley performed the suitmation sequences for the adult Godzilla [15]\n\n\nCultural impact\nGodzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide [125] [126] and remains an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre Godzilla's vaguely humanoid appearance and strained, lumbering movements endeared it to Japanese audiences, who could relate to Godzilla as a sympathetic character, despite its wrathful nature [127] Audiences respond positively to the character because it acts out of rage and self-preservation and shows where science and technology can go wrong [128]\n\n\nCultural ambassador\nIn April 2015, the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo named Godzilla a special resident and official tourism ambassador to encourage tourism [168] [169] During an unveiling of a giant Godzilla bust at Toho headquarters, Shinjuku mayor Kenichi Yoshizumi stated, \"Godzilla is a character that is the pride of Japan.\" The mayor extended a residency certificate to an actor in a rubber suit representing Godzilla, but as the suit's hands were not designed for grasping, it was accepted on Godzilla's behalf by a Toho executive Reporters noted that Shinjuku's ward has been flattened by Godzilla in three Toho movies [169]

The poem has been widely praised for its message of unity, hope, and reflection on the past, and has been recognized as a highlight of the inauguration.\n\n**Background and Writing**\n\nAmanda Gorman is an American poet from Los Angeles, California. In 2017, at the age of 19, she was named the first National Youth Poet Laureate. On January 14, 2021, the Inaugural Committee announced that Gorman would be giving a poetry reading at the inauguration of President Joe Biden in Washington, D.C. on January 20. Gorman began writing the poem by reviewing poems written by past inaugural poets, including Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. She also studied famous orators such as Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Winston Churchill. Gorman spoke with Richard Blanco and Elizabeth Alexander, two previous inaugural poets, to gain insight and guidance.\n\n**Content**\n\nThe poem begins with the lines:\n\n\"When day comes, we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid\nThe new dawn blooms as we free it\nFor there is always light\nIf only we're brave enough to see it\nIf only we're brave enough to be it\"\n\nThe poem goes on to explore themes of hope, unity, and reflection on the past. Gorman writes about the importance of being brave enough to see and be the light, and about the need to free oneself from the shadows of the past. The poem also touches on the idea of a new dawn, symbolizing a new beginning and a fresh start.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe poem was widely praised by figures including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, Michelle Obama, and Barack Obama. Critics generally received the poem very well, noting that it would likely remain significant beyond the inauguration. Many critics named the poem as a highlight of the inauguration and praised Gorman's messages of unity, reflections on the past, and hope for the future. Several critics also drew parallels between her poem and the works of other inaugural poets, such as Frost and Blanco.\n\n**Outfit**\n\nSeveral reporters noted Gorman's outfit, which included jewelry that was given to her by Oprah Winfrey, a yellow coat designed by Miuccia Prada, and a red puff satin headband, also designed by Prada. Gorman sought to honor Maya Angelou by wearing a ring that depicted a caged bird, referencing Angelou's poem \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\".\n\n**Publication**\n\nShortly after the inauguration, Penguin Young Readers announced a publication of 150,000 hardcover copies of the poem in spring 2021, set to begin on April 27. The poem was also included in Gorman's first published collection of poetry, titled The Hill We Climb, which was released by Viking Books for Young Readers in September 2021.

Many critics maintained that only a young black woman could properly translate the poem, while others argued that this was unpractical, particularly when considering the scarcity of competent translators fitting those specifications. Aaron Robertson, a black translator, told The New York Times that \"this feels something of a watershed moment\".\n\n**Restriction**\n\nGorman's poetry collection The Hill We Climb was restricted to an area reserved for middle school students at Bob Graham Education Center in Miami Lakes, Florida in 2023.

for Woodstock in February 1874 [4] His mother, Jennie, was a daughter of Leonard Jerome, an American businessman [5]\n\n\nChildhood and schooling: 1874–1895\nChurchill was born on 30 November 1874 at

Randolph Churchill, representing the Conservative Party, had been elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Woodstock in February 1874 [4] His mother, Jennie, was a daughter of Leonard Jerome, an American businessman [5]\n\n\nCuba, India, and Sudan: 1895–1899\nIn February 1895, Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars regiment of the British Army, based at Aldershot [19] Eager to witness military action, he used his mother's influence to get posted to a war zone [20] In the autumn, he and friend Reggie Barnes, went to observe the Cuban War of Independence and became involved in skirmishes after joining Spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters [21] Churchill sent reports to the Daily Graphic in London [22] He proceeded to New York and wrote to his mother about \"what an extraordinary people the Americans are!\" [23] With the Hussars, he went to Bombay in October 1896 [24] Based in Bangalore, he was in India for 19 months, visiting Calcutta and joining expeditions to Hyderabad and the North West Frontier [25]\n\n\nPolitics and South Africa: 1899–1901\nChurchill spoke at Conservative meetings [48] and was selected as one of the party's two candidates for the June 1899 Oldham by-election [49] While campaigning, Churchill referred to himself as \"a Conservative and a Tory Democrat\" [50] Although the seats had been held by the Conservatives, the result was a narrow Liberal victory [51]\n\n\nConservative MP: 1901–1904\nIn February 1901, Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons, where his maiden speech gained widespread coverage [68] He associated with a group of Conservatives known as the Hughligans, [69] but was critical of the Conservative government on various issues, especially increases in army funding He believed additional military expenditure should go to the navy [70] This upset the Conservative front bench but was supported by Liberals, with whom he increasingly socialised, particularly Liberal Imperialists like H H Asquith [71] Churchill later wrote that he \"drifted steadily to the left\" [72] He privately considered \"the gradual creation by an evolutionary process of a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party\", [73] or alternately a \"Central Party\" to unite the Conservatives and Liberals [74]\n\n\nLiberal MP: 1904–1908\nAs a Liberal, Churchill attacked government policy and gained a reputation as a radical under the influences of John Morley and David Lloyd George [22] In December 1905, Balfour resigned as prime minister and King Edward VII invited the Liberal leader Henry Campbell-Bannerman to replace him [83] Hoping to secure a working majority, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election in January 1906, which the Liberals won in a massive landslide [84] Churchill won the Manchester North West seat [85] and his biography of his father was published; [86] he received advance payment of £8,000 [87] It was generally well received [88] The first biography of Churchill himself, written by the Liberal MacCallum Scott, was published [89]\n\n\nAsquith government: 1908–1915\nWith Campbell-Bannerman terminally ill, Asquith became prime minister in April 1908 He appointed Churchill as President of the Board of Trade [98] Aged 33, Churchill was the youngest Cabinet member since 1866 [99] Newly appointed Cabinet ministers were legally obliged to seek re-election at a by-election On 24 April, Churchill lost the Manchester North West by-election to the Conservative candidate by 429 votes [100] On 9 May, the Liberals stood him in the safe seat of Dundee, where he won comfortably [101]\n\n\nPresident of the Board of Trade: 1908–1910\nWith Campbell-Bannerman terminally ill,

Liberals stood him in the safe seat of Dundee, where he won comfortably [101]\n\n\nHome Secretary: 1910–1911\nIn February 1910, Churchill was promoted to Home Secretary, giving him control over the police and prison services; [123] he implemented a prison reform programme [124] Measures included a distinction between criminal and political prisoners, with rules for the latter being relaxed [125] There were educational innovations like the establishment of libraries, [126] and a requirement to stage entertainments four times a year [127] The rules on solitary confinement were relaxed, [128] and Churchill proposed abolition of automatic imprisonment of those who failed to pay fines [129] Imprisonment of people aged between 16 and 21 was abolished except for the most serious offences [130] Churchill reduced (\"commuted\") 21 of the 43 death (\"capital\") sentences passed while he was Home Secretary [131]\n\n\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty\nIn October 1911, Asquith appointed Churchill First Lord of the Admiralty, [149] and he took up official residence at Admiralty House [150] He created a naval war staff [22] and, over the next two and a half years, focused on naval preparation, visiting naval stations and dockyards, seeking to improve morale, and scrutinising German naval developments [151] After Germany passed its 1912 Naval Law to increase warship production, Churchill vowed that for every new German battleship, Britain would build two [152] He invited Germany to engage in a mutual de-escalation, but this was refused [153]\n\n\nMilitary service, 1915–1916\nOn 25 November 1915, Churchill resigned from the government, although he remained an MP Asquith rejected his request to be appointed Governor-General of British East Africa [179] Churchill decided to return to active service with the Army and was attached to the 2nd Grenadier Guards, on the Western Front [180] In January 1916, he was temporarily promoted to lieutenant-colonel and given command of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers [181] [182] The battalion was moved to a sector of the Belgian Front near Ploegsteert [183] For three months, they faced continual shelling, though no German offensive [184] Churchill narrowly escaped death when, during a visit by his cousin Marlborough, a large piece of shrapnel fell between them [185] In May, the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers were merged into the 15th Division Churchill did not request a new command, instead securing permission to leave active service [186] His temporary promotion ended on 16 May 1916, when he returned to the rank of major [187]\n\n\nLloyd George government: 1916–1922\nIn October 1916, Asquith resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Lloyd George who, in May 1917, sent Churchill to inspect the French war effort [192] In July, Churchill was appointed Minister of Munitions [193] He negotiated an end to a strike in munitions factories along the Clyde and increased munitions production [194] In his October 1917 letter to his Cabinet colleagues, he penned the plan of attack for the next year, that would bring final victory to the Allies [189] He ended a second strike, in June 1918, by threatening to conscript strikers into the army [195] In the House of Commons, Churchill voted in support of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave some women the right to vote [196] In November 1918, four days after the Armistice, Churchill's fourth child, Marigold, was born [197]\n\n\nMinister of Munitions: 1917–1919\nIn October 1916, Asquith resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Lloyd George who, in May 1917, sent Churchill to inspect the French war effort [192] In July, Churchill was appointed Minister of Munitions [193] He negotiated an end to a strike in munitions factories along the Clyde and increased munitions production [194] In his October 1917 letter to his Cabinet colleagues, he penned the plan of attack for the next year, that would bring final victory to the Allies [189]

gave some women the right to vote [196] In November 1918, four days after the Armistice, Churchill's fourth child, Marigold, was born [197]\n\n\nSecretary of State for War and Air: 1919–1921\nLloyd George called a general election for 14 December 1918 [198] During the campaign, Churchill called for nationalisation of the railways, a control on monopolies, tax reform, and the creation of a League of Nations to prevent wars [199] He was returned as MP for Dundee and, though the Conservatives won a majority, Lloyd George was retained as prime minister [199] In January 1919, Lloyd George moved Churchill to the War Office as both Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for Air [200]\n\n\nSecretary of State for the Colonies: 1921–1922\nChurchill became Secretary of State for the Colonies in February 1921 [211] The following month, the first exhibit of his paintings took place in Paris, with Churchill exhibiting under a pseudonym [211] In May, his mother died, followed in August by his daughter Marigold, from sepsis [212] Churchill was haunted by Marigold's death for the rest of his life [213]\n\n\nOut of Parliament: 1922–1924\nChurchill spent much of the next six months at the Villa Rêve d'Or near Cannes, where he devoted himself to painting and writing his memoirs [222] He wrote an autobiographical history of the war, The World Crisis The first volume was published in April 1923 and the rest over the next ten years [219] After the 1923 general election was called, seven Liberal associations asked Churchill to stand as their candidate, and he selected Leicester West, but did not win [223] A Labour government led by Ramsay MacDonald took power Churchill had hoped they would be defeated by a Conservative-Liberal coalition [224] He strongly opposed the MacDonald government's decision to loan money to Soviet Russia and feared the signing of an Anglo-Soviet Treaty [225]\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer: 1924–1929\nBecoming Chancellor on 6 November 1924, Churchill formally rejoined the Conservative Party [230] As Chancellor, he intended to pursue his free trade principles in the form of laissez-faire economics, as under the Liberal social reforms [230] In April 1925, he controversially albeit reluctantly, restored the gold standard in his first budget, at its 1914 parity, against the advice of leading economists including John Maynard Keynes [231] The return to gold is held to have caused deflation and resultant unemployment with a devastating impact on the coal industry [232] Churchill presented five budgets in all to April 1929 Among his measures were reduction of the state pension age from 70 to 65; immediate provision of widow's pensions; reduction of military expenditure; income tax reductions and imposition of taxes on luxury items [233]\n\n\nThe \"Wilderness Years\": 1929–1939\nIn the 1929 general election, Churchill retained his Epping seat, but the Conservatives were defeated, and MacDonald formed his second Labour government [238] Out of office, Churchill was prone to depression (his \"black dog\") but addressed this by writing [239] He began work on Marlborough: His Life and Times, a biography of his ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough [240] [241] He had developed a reputation for being a heavy drinker, although Jenkins believes that was often exaggerated [242]\n\n\nMarlborough and the India Question: 1929–1932\nIn the 1929 general election, Churchill retained his Epping seat, but the Conservatives were defeated, and MacDonald formed his second Labour government [238] Out of office, Churchill was prone to depression (his \"black dog\") but addressed this by writing [239] He began work on Marlborough: His Life and Times, a biography of his ancestor John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough [240] [241] He had developed a reputation for being a heavy drinker, although Jenkins believes that was often exaggerated [242]\n\n\nWarnings about Germany and the abdication crisis: 1933–1936\nAfter Hitler came to power in January 1933, Churchill was quick to recognise the menace of such a regime, and expressed alarm that the British government had reduced air force spending, and warned that Germany would soon overtake Britain in air force production [257] [258] Armed with data provided clandestinely by senior civil servants, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, Churchill was able to speak with authority about what was happening in Germany, especially the development of the Luftwaffe [259] He spoke of his concerns in a radio broadcast in November 1934, [260] having denounced the intolerance and militarism of Nazism in the House of Commons [261] While Churchill regarded Mussolini's regime as a bulwark against the threat of communist revolution, he opposed the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, [262] despite describing the country as a primitive, uncivilised nation [263] He admired the exiled king of Spain Alfonso XIII and feared Communism was making inroads during the Spanish Civil War  He referred to Franco's army as the \"anti-red movement\", but later became critical of Franco as too close to Mussolini and Hitler [264] [265]\n\n\nAnti-appeasement: 1937–1939\nIn May 1937, Baldwin resigned and was succeeded as prime minister by Neville Chamberlain At first, Churchill welcomed Chamberlain's appointment but, in February 1938, matters came to a head after Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden resigned over Chamberlain's appeasement of Mussolini, [272] a policy which Chamberlain was extending towards Hitler [273] In 1938, Churchill warned the government against appeasement and called for collective action to deter German aggression [274] [275] Following the Anschluss, Churchill spoke in the House of Commons:\n\n\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty: September 1939 to May 1940\nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlain's war cabinet [283] Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called \"Phoney War\" Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on \"a brilliant sea fight\" [284] On 16 February 1940, Churchill ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer HMS Cossack to board the German supply ship Altmark in Norwegian waters freeing 299 British merchant seamen who had been captured by the Admiral Graf Spee These actions, and his speeches, enhanced Churchill's reputation [284] He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic and wanted to send a naval force, but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed Operation Wilfred, to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany [285] Due to disagreements, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion of Norway [286]\n\n\nPhoney War and the Norwegian Campaign\nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlain's war cabinet [283] Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called \"Phoney War\" Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on \"a brilliant sea fight\" [284] On 16 February 1940, Churchill ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer HMS Cossack to board the German supply ship Altmark in Norwegian waters freeing 299 British merchant seamen who had been captured by the Admiral Graf Spee These actions, and his speeches, enhanced Churchill's reputation [284] He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic and wanted to send a naval force, but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed Operation Wilfred, to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany [285] Due to disagreements, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion of Norway [286]\n\n\nNorway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation\nAfter the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held a debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war This became known as the Norway Debate, one of the most significant events in parliamentary history [287] On the second day, the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government [288] Churchill was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his prestige [289] Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government [290]\n\n\nPrime Minister: 1940–45\nIn May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party [296] Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality [297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended most meetings [298] [299] The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, a key appointment being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service [300] In response to criticisms, Churchill created and assumed the position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in history [301] He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor [302]\n\n\nDunkirk to Pearl Harbor: May 1940 to December 1941\nIn May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party [296] Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality [297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended most meetings [298] [299] The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, a key appointment being the leading

wartime prime minister in history [301] He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor [302]\n\n\nWar ministry created\nIn May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party [296] Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality [297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister

Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in history [301] He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor [302]\n\n\nResolve to fight on\nAt the end of May, with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France imminent, Halifax proposed the government should explore a peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary There were high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including with the French premier Paul Reynaud [303] Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him By gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over [304]\n\n\nOperation Dynamo and the Battle of France\nThe Dunkirk evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen, ended on 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered The total was far in excess of expectations and gave rise to a popular view Dunkirk had been a miracle, even a victory [311] Churchill himself referred to \"a miracle of deliverance\" in his \"we shall fight on the beaches\" speech to the Commons that afternoon The speech ended on a note of defiance, with a clear appeal to the United States: [312] [313]\n\n\nBattle of Britain and the Blitz\nOn 20 August 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Churchill addressed the Commons to outline the situation In the middle of it, he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle: [321] [322]\n\n\nLend-Lease\nIn September 1940, the British and American governments concluded the destroyers-for-bases deal, by which 50 American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland An added advantage for Britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere [325] Churchill's good relations with President Franklin D Roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes [326] It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940 Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain, without the need for monetary payment He persuaded Congress that repayment for this costly service would take the form of defending the US The policy was known as Lend-Lease and was formally enacted on 11 March 1941 [327]\n\n\nOperation Barbarossa\nHitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 Churchill had known since April, from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park, that the attack was imminent He had tried to warn Joseph Stalin via the ambassador to Moscow, Stafford Cripps, but Stalin did not trust Churchill The night before the attack, already intending to address the nation, Churchill alluded to his hitherto anti-communist views by saying to Colville: \"If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil\" [328]\n\n\nAtlantic Charter\nIn August 1941, Churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board HMS Prince of Wales and met Roosevelt in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland On 14 August, they issued the joint statement known as the Atlantic Charter [329] This outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, itself the basis of the UN, founded in 1945 [330]\n\n\nPearl Harbor to D-Day: December 1941 to June 1944\nIn December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations, Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: \"Now is your chance Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.\" No meeting took place and there is no record of a response [331] Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference This was important for \"Europe first\", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success [332] It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa Originally planned for the spring 1942, it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway [333]\n\n\nPearl Harbor and United States entry into the war\nIn December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations, Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: \"Now is your chance Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.\" No meeting took place and there is no record of a response [331] Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference This was important for \"Europe first\", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success [332] It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa Originally planned for the spring 1942, it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway [333]\n\n\nFall of Singapore and loss of Burma\nChurchill already had grave concerns about the quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway, France, Greece and Crete [339] Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, he felt his misgivings were confirmed and said: \"(this is) the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history\" [340] On 11 February the Kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious \"Channel Dash\", a massive blow to British naval prestige The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchill's morale to its lowest point of the war [339]\n\n\nThe Bengal Famine\nMeanwhile, the Japanese had occupied most of Burma by the end of April 1942 Counter-offensives were hampered by the monsoon season and disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar, as well as a severe cyclone which devastated the region in October 1942 A combination of factors, including the curtailment of essential rice imports from Burma, poor administration, wartime inflation and large-scale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the Bengal famine of 1943, [341] in which an estimated 2.1–3.8 million people died [342]\n\n\nInternational conferences in 1942\nOn 20 May 1942, the Soviet Foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in London to sign a treaty of friendship Molotov wanted it done on the basis of territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and a twenty-year treaty was formalised, with the question of frontiers placed on hold Molotov also sought a Second Front in Europe; Churchill confirmed preparations were in progress and made no promises on a date [350]\n\n\nEl Alamein and Stalingrad\nWhile he was in Cairo in August, Churchill appointed Field Marshal Alexander as Field Marshal Auchinleck's successor as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but he was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo, and General Montgomery succeeded him [357]\n\n\nInternational conferences in 1943\nIn January 1943, Churchill met Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference It was attended by General Charles de Gaulle from the Free French Forces Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of Stalingrad Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing \"unconditional surrender\" [358] [359] From Morocco, Churchill went to Cairo, Adana, Cyprus, Cairo again and Algiers He arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for a month He addressed the Commons on the 11th and became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than a month of convalescence: he moved to Chequers He returned to work in London on 15 March [360]\n\n\nInvasions of Sicily and Italy\nIn the autumn of 1942, after Churchill's meeting with Stalin, he was approached by Eisenhower, commanding the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe According to General Mark W Clark, the Americans admitted a cross-Channel operation in the near future was \"utterly impossible\" As an alternative, Churchill recommended \"slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean\" and persuaded them to invade Sicily and then mainland Italy, after they had defeated the Afrika Korps  After the war, Clark still agreed Churchill's analysis was correct, but added that, when the Allies landed at Salerno, they found Italy was \"a tough old gut\" [366]\n\n\nPreparations for D-Day\nThe difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to change heart about strategy; when the Anzio stalemate developed after his return to England from North Africa, he threw himself into the planning of Overlord and set up meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff These were attended by Eisenhower or his chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith Churchill was especially taken by the Mulberry harbours, but was keen to make the most of Allied airpower which by 1944, had become overwhelming [371] Churchill never lost his apprehension about the invasion, and underwent mood fluctuation as D-Day approached Jenkins says he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier [372]\n\n\nNeed for post-war reform\nChurchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms The Beveridge Report with its five \"Giant Evils\" was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid popular acclaim [373] Even so, Churchill spent most of his focus on the war, and saw reform in terms of tidying up His attitude was demonstrated in a radio broadcast on 26 March 1944 He was obliged to devote most of it to reform and showed a distinct lack of interest Colville said Churchill had broadcast \"indifferently\" and Harold Nicolson said that, to many people, Churchill came across the air as \"a worn and petulant old man\" [374] In the end, however, it was demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge Attlee, Bevin and Labour's other coalition ministers, were seen as working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate [375] [376]\n\n\nDefeat of Germany: June 1944 to May 1945\nChurchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day (6 June 1944) or at least D-Day+1 His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF, until he was effectively vetoed by the King Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but fewer than 8,000 died in all of June [377] He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was five miles inland That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched On 22–23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour [378]\n\n\nD-Day: Allied invasion of Normandy\nChurchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day (6 June 1944) or at least D-Day+1 His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF, until he was effectively vetoed by the King Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but fewer than 8,000 died in all of June [377] He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was five miles inland That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched On 22–23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour [378]\n\n\nQuebec Conference, September 1944\nChurchill met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944 They reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise, but de-industrialise Eden opposed it and was able to persuade Churchill to disown it US Secretary of State Cordell Hull opposed it and convinced Roosevelt it was infeasible [379]\n\n\nMoscow Conference, October 1944\nAt the fourth Moscow conference in October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called \"Percentages agreement\" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans [380] By then, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, \"get at cross-purposes in small ways\" [381] He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it The agreement was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria The United Kingdom and United States would have 90% control of Greece Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each [382] In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in The Second World War), Soviet authorities denied Stalin had accepted such an \"imperialist proposal\" [380]\n\n\nYalta Conference, February 1945\nFrom 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt met for their Malta Conference ahead of the second \"Big Three\" event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February [383] Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland's post-war status, which Churchill saw as a test case for Eastern Europe [384] Churchill faced criticism for the agreement on Poland For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month Jenkins, however, maintains that Churchill did as well as possible in difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support [385]\n\n\nArea bombing controversy\nOn the nights of 13–15 February 1945, 1,200 British and US bombers attacked Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front [388] [389] The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war [390] Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll of about 24,000 [391] On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing [392] and sent a memo to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee: [393] [394]\n\n\nVE Day (Victory in Europe Day)\nOn 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germany's surrender The next day was Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) when Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night [396] Churchill went to Buckingham Palace where he appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens He went from the palace to Whitehall where he addressed another large crowd: \"God bless you all This is your victory In our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this Everyone, man or woman, has done their best\" [397]\n\n\nOperation Unthinkable\nIn May 1945, Winston Churchill commissioned the Chiefs of Staff Committee to provide its thoughts on a possible military campaign against the USSR, code-named Operation Unthinkable [400] One plan involved a surprise attack on Soviet troops stationed in Germany to impose \"the will of the United States and the British Empire\" on the Soviets [401] The hypothetical start date for the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was set for 1 July 1945 [401]\n\n\nCaretaker government: May 1945 to July 1945\nWith a general election looming, and with Labour ministers refusing to continue the coalition, Churchill resigned as prime minister on 23 May 1945 Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the National Government but sometimes called the caretaker ministry It contained Conservatives, National Liberals and a few non-party figures such as Sir John Anderson and Lord Woolton, but not Labour or Archibald Sinclair's Official Liberals Churchill was formally reappointed on 28 May [402] [403]\n\n\nPotsdam Conference\nChurchill was Great Britain's representative at the Potsdam Conference when it opened on 17 July and was accompanied at its sessions by Eden and Attlee They attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to England for their election counts After the landslide Labour victory, Attlee returned with Bevin as the new Foreign Secretary and there were five days of discussion [404] Potsdam went badly for Churchill Eden later described his performance as \"appalling\", saying he was unprepared and verbose Churchill upset the Chinese, exasperated the Americans and was easily led by Stalin, whom he was supposed to be resisting [405]\n\n\nGeneral election, July 1945\nChurchill mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate Labour [406] On 4 June, he committed a serious gaffe by saying in a radio broadcast that a Labour government would require \"some form of Gestapo\" to enforce its agenda [407] [408] It backfired and Attlee made political capital by saying in his reply broadcast next day: \"The voice we

supported the creations of the Council of Europe in 1949 and the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, but his support was always with the firm proviso that Britain must not actually join any federal grouping [423] [424] [425]\n\n\nIreland\nHaving lived in Ireland as a child, Churchill always opposed its partition As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921, he suggested that Ulster should be part of a united Ireland, but with a degree of autonomy from an independent Irish government He was always opposed on this by Ulster Unionists [426] While he was Leader of the Opposition, he told John Dulanty and Frederick Boland, successive Irish ambassadors to London, that he still hoped for reunification [427]\n\n\n1950 and 1951 Elections\nLabour won the 1950 general election, but with a much-reduced majority [428] A fresh election was called the following year and the Conservatives won a majority.\n\n\nPrime Minister: 1951–1955\nDespite losing the popular vote, the Conservatives won

77 when he took office and not in good health following minor strokes [432] By December 1951, George VI had become concerned about Churchill's decline and intended asking him to stand down in favour of Eden, but the King had his own health issues and died on 6 February 1952 [433] Churchill developed a friendship with Elizabeth II and, in spring 1953, accepted the Order of the Garter at her request [434] He was knighted as Sir Winston on 24 April 1953 [435] It was widely expected he would retire after the Queen's Coronation in June 1953 but, after Eden became seriously ill, Churchill increased his own responsibilities by taking over at the Foreign Office [436] [437] [438] Eden was incapacitated until the end of the year and never completely well again [439] On the evening of 23

America He made four official transatlantic visits from January 1952 to July 1954 [444] He enjoyed a good relationship with Truman, but difficulties arose over the planned European Defence Community (EDC), by which Truman hoped to reduce America's military presence in West Germany [445] Churchill wanted US military support of British interests in Egypt and the Middle East, but while Truman expected British military involvement in Korea, he viewed any US commitment to the Middle East as maintaining British imperialism [446] The Americans recognised the British Empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the Attlee government's policy of decolonisation Churchill believed Britain's position as a world power depended on the empire's continued existence [447]\n\n\nLater life: 1955–1965\nElizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of Randolph, who would have inherited the title [458] Although publicly supportive, Churchill was privately scathing about Eden's handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of his visits to the US in the following years were attempts to repair Anglo-American relations [459]\n\n\nRetirement: 1955–1964\nElizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of Randolph, who would have inherited the title [458]

[463]\n\n\nArtist, historian, and writer\nChurchill was a prolific writer His output included a novel (Savrola), two biographies, memoirs, histories, and press articles Two of his most famous works were his six-volume memoir, The Second World War, and the four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples [472] In recognition of his \"mastery of historical and biographical description\" and oratorial output, Churchill received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 [473]\n\n\nLegacy and assessments\nJenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising: [464]\n\n\n\"A man of destiny\"\nJenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising: [464]\n\n\nPolitical

subject peoples [515] He advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing the British Empire maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies [345]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nWhile biographies by Addison, Gilbert, Jenkins and Rhodes James are among the most acclaimed works about Churchill, he has been the subject of numerous others David Freeman counted 62 in English to the end of the 20th century [523] At a public ceremony in Westminster Hall on 30 November 1954, Churchill's 80th birthday, the joint Houses of Parliament presented him with a full-length portrait of himself, painted by Graham Sutherland [524] Churchill and Clementine reportedly hated it and she had it destroyed [525] [526]\n\n\nFamily\nChurchill married Clementine Hozier in September 1908 [531] They remained married for 57 years until his death [107] Churchill was aware of the strain his career placed on their marriage [532] According to Colville, he had an affair in the 1930s with Doris Castlerosse, [533] although this is discounted by Andrew Roberts [534]\n\n\nNotes\nOther references and online

politician, army officer, and writer, best known for his leadership of the United Kingdom during World War II. He was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders in history.\n\nEarly life\n\nChurchill was born on November 30, 1874, at his family's ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. He was the son of Lord Randolph Churchill and Jennie Jerome, an American heiress. Churchill's father was a prominent figure in the Conservative Party, and his mother was a member of the wealthy Jerome family. Churchill's early life was marked by a strong sense of duty and service to his country. He was educated at Harrow School and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.\n\nChildhood and schooling\n\nChurchill's childhood was marked by a strong sense of adventure and a love of learning. He was a skilled artist and writer, and began to develop his writing skills at an early age. He was particularly drawn to history and politics, and spent much of his childhood reading and writing about these subjects. Churchill's father, Lord Randolph, was a prominent figure in the Conservative Party, and his son was deeply influenced by his father's politics. However, Churchill's father's health began to decline when Winston was just 21, and he died in 1895.\n\nCuba, India, and Sudan: 1895–1899\n\nIn February 1895, Churchill was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars regiment of the British Army.

Churchill sent reports to the Daily Graphic in London, and wrote to his mother about his experiences. He went to Bombay in October 1896, based in Bangalore, and visited Calcutta and Hyderabad. He was posted to the North West Frontier, where he was involved in expeditions to the Tirah Campaign.\n\nPolitics and South Africa: 1899–1901\n\nChurchill spoke at Conservative meetings, and was selected as one of the party's two candidates for the Oldham by-election.

Churchill took his seat in the House of Commons in February 1901, and made his maiden speech, gaining widespread coverage.\n\nConservative MP: 1901–1904\n\nChurchill associated with a group of Conservatives known as the Hughligans, but was critical of the Conservative government on various issues.

However, his views were supported by Liberals, particularly Liberal Imperialists like H H Asquith. Churchill later wrote that he \"drifted steadily to the left.\" He privately considered creating a Democratic or Progressive wing to the Conservative Party, or a Central Party to unite Conservatives and Liberals.\n\nLiberal MP: 1904–1908\n\nChurchill attacked government policy and gained a reputation as a radical under the influences of John Morley and David Lloyd George.

However, Churchill's tenure was short-lived, as he was defeated in a by-election in Manchester North West.\n\nHome Secretary: 1910–1911\n\nChurchill was appointed Home Secretary in February 1910, and introduced a number of reforms aimed at improving prison conditions and reducing the use of solitary confinement. He also proposed the abolition of automatic imprisonment of those who failed to pay fines.\n\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty: 1911–1915\n\nChurchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in October 1911, and created a naval war staff. He focused on naval preparation, visiting stations and dockyards, and scrutinizing German naval developments. Churchill vowed that for every new German battleship, Britain would build two.\n\nMilitary service: 1915–1916\n\nChurchill resigned from the government in November 1915, and requested to be appointed Governor-General of British East Africa. However, this request was rejected, and Churchill decided to return to active service with the Army. He was attached to the 2nd Grenadier Guards, and temporarily promoted to lieutenant-colonel.\n\nLloyd George government: 1916–1922\n\nChurchill supported the government's decision to send a naval force to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany. He was a key figure in the planning of the Overlord invasion, and was critical of the Anzio stalemate. Churchill attended the Potsdam Conference, but his performance was described as \"appalling\" by Eden.\n\nLeader of the Opposition: 1922–1939\n\nChurchill became the Leader of the Opposition in 1922, and served in this role until 1939. During this period, he was in America from January to March 1946, where he gave his famous \"Iron Curtain\" speech about the USSR and its creation of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nPrime Minister: 1940–1945\n\nChurchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, and led the country through World War II.

1924, Churchill formally rejoined the Conservative Party [230] As Chancellor, he intended to pursue his free trade principles in the form of laissez-faire economics, as under the Liberal social reforms [230] In April 1925, he controversially albeit reluctantly, restored the gold standard in his first budget, at its 1914 parity, against the advice of leading economists including John Maynard Keynes [231] The return to gold is held to have caused deflation and resultant unemployment with a devastating impact on the coal industry [232] Churchill presented five budgets in all to April 1929

1933–1936\nAfter Hitler came to power in January 1933, Churchill was quick to recognise the menace of such a regime, and expressed alarm that the British government had reduced air force spending, and warned that Germany would soon overtake Britain in air force production [257] [258] Armed with data provided clandestinely by senior civil servants, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, Churchill was able to speak with authority about what was happening in Germany, especially the development of the Luftwaffe [259] He spoke of his concerns in a radio broadcast in November 1934, [260] having denounced the intolerance and militarism of Nazism in the House of Commons [261] While Churchill regarded Mussolini's regime as a bulwark against the threat of communist revolution, he opposed the Italian

to May 1940\nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlain's war cabinet [283] Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called \"Phoney War\" Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on \"a brilliant sea fight\" [284] On 16 February 1940, Churchill ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer HMS Cossack to board the German supply ship Altmark in Norwegian waters freeing 299 British merchant seamen who had been captured by the Admiral Graf Spee These actions, and his speeches, enhanced Churchill's reputation [284] He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic and wanted to send a naval force, but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed Operation Wilfred, to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany [285] Due to disagreements, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion of Norway [286]\n\n\nPhoney War and the Norwegian Campaign\nOn 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Chamberlain reappointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty and he joined Chamberlain's war cabinet [283] Churchill was a highest-profile minister during the so-called \"Phoney War\" Churchill

Norway [286]\n\n\nNorway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation\nAfter the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held a debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war This became known as the Norway Debate, one of the most significant events in parliamentary history [287] On the second day, the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government [288] Churchill was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his prestige [289] Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government [290]\n\n\nPrime Minister: 1940–45\nIn May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party [296] Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality [297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended most meetings [298] [299] The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, a key appointment being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service [300] In response to criticisms, Churchill created and assumed the position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in history [301] He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front These included friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor [302]\n\n\nDunkirk to Pearl Harbor: May 1940 to December 1941\nIn May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives and most of the Labour Party [296] Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality [297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet: Chamberlain as Lord President of the

remained Conservative Party leader until October By that time, Churchill had won over his doubters and his succession was a formality [297] He began his premiership by forming a war cabinet:

like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor [302]\n\n\nResolve to fight on\nAt the end of May, with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France imminent, Halifax proposed the government should explore a peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary There were high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including with the French premier Paul Reynaud [303] Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him By gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over [304]\n\n\nOperation Dynamo and the Battle of France\nThe Dunkirk evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen, ended on 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered The total was far in excess of expectations and gave rise to a popular view Dunkirk had been a miracle, even a victory [311] Churchill himself referred to \"a miracle of deliverance\" in his \"we shall fight on the beaches\" speech to the Commons that afternoon The speech ended on a note of defiance, with a clear appeal to the United States: [312] [313]\n\n\nBattle of Britain and the Blitz\nOn 20 August 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Churchill addressed the Commons to outline the situation In the middle of it, he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle: [321] [322]\n\n\nLend-Lease\nIn September 1940, the British and American governments concluded the destroyers-for-bases deal, by which 50 American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland An added advantage for Britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere [325] Churchill's good relations with President Franklin D Roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes [326] It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940 Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain, without the need for monetary payment He persuaded Congress that repayment for this costly service would take the form of defending the US The policy was known as Lend-Lease and was formally enacted on 11 March 1941 [327]\n\n\nOperation Barbarossa\nHitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 Churchill had known since April, from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park, that the attack was imminent He had tried to warn Joseph Stalin via the ambassador to Moscow, Stafford Cripps, but Stalin did not trust Churchill The night before the attack, already intending to address the nation, Churchill alluded to his hitherto anti-communist views by saying to Colville: \"If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil\" [328]\n\n\nAtlantic Charter\nIn August 1941, Churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board HMS Prince of Wales and met Roosevelt in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland On 14 August, they issued the joint statement known as the Atlantic Charter [329] This outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, itself the basis of the UN, founded in 1945 [330]\n\n\nPearl Harbor to D-Day: December 1941 to June 1944\nIn December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations, Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: \"Now is your chance Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.\" No meeting took place and there is no record of a response [331] Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference This was important for \"Europe first\", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success [332] It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa Originally planned for the spring 1942, it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway [333]\n\n\nPearl Harbor and United States entry into the war\nIn December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan With the hope of using Irish ports for counter-submarine operations, Churchill sent a telegram to Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera in which he obliquely offers Irish unity: \"Now is your chance Now or never! A nation once again! I will meet you wherever you wish.\" No meeting took place and there is no record of a response [331] Churchill went to Washington to meet Roosevelt for the Arcadia Conference This was important for \"Europe first\", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in the mid-Atlantic The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and defeat of Germany was key to Allied success [332] It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa Originally planned for the spring 1942, it was launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was underway [333]\n\n\nFall of Singapore and loss of Burma\nChurchill already had grave concerns about the quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway, France, Greece and Crete [339] Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, he felt his misgivings were confirmed and said: \"(this is) the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history\" [340] On 11 February the Kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious \"Channel Dash\", a massive blow to British naval prestige The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchill's morale to its lowest point of the war [339]\n\n\nThe Bengal Famine\nMeanwhile, the Japanese had occupied most of Burma by the end of April 1942 Counter-offensives were hampered by the monsoon season and disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar, as well as a severe cyclone which devastated the region in October 1942 A combination of factors, including the curtailment of essential rice imports from Burma, poor administration, wartime inflation and large-scale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the Bengal famine of 1943, [341] in which an estimated 2.1–3.8 million people died [342]\n\n\nInternational conferences in 1942\nOn 20 May 1942, the Soviet Foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in London to sign a treaty of friendship Molotov wanted it done on the basis of territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and a twenty-year treaty was formalised, with the question of frontiers placed on hold Molotov also sought a Second Front in Europe; Churchill confirmed preparations were in progress and made no promises on a date [350]\n\n\nEl Alamein and Stalingrad\nWhile he was in Cairo in August, Churchill appointed Field Marshal Alexander as Field Marshal Auchinleck's successor as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but he was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo, and General Montgomery succeeded him [357]\n\n\nInternational conferences in 1943\nIn January 1943, Churchill met Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference It was attended by General Charles de Gaulle from the Free French Forces Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of Stalingrad Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing \"unconditional surrender\" [358] [359] From Morocco, Churchill went to Cairo, Adana, Cyprus, Cairo again and Algiers He arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for a month He addressed the Commons on the 11th and became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than a month of convalescence: he moved to Chequers He returned to work in London on 15 March [360]\n\n\nInvasions of Sicily and Italy\nIn the autumn of 1942, after Churchill's meeting with Stalin, he was approached by Eisenhower, commanding the North African Theater of Operations, US Army (NATOUSA), and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe According to General Mark W Clark, the Americans admitted a cross-Channel operation in the near future was \"utterly impossible\" As an alternative, Churchill recommended \"slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean\" and persuaded them to invade Sicily and then mainland Italy, after they had defeated the Afrika Korps  After the war, Clark still agreed Churchill's analysis was correct, but added that, when the Allies landed at Salerno, they found Italy was \"a tough old gut\" [366]\n\n\nPreparations for D-Day\nThe difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to change heart about strategy; when the Anzio stalemate developed after his return to England from North Africa, he threw himself into the planning of Overlord and set up meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff These were attended by Eisenhower or his chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith Churchill was especially taken by the Mulberry harbours, but was keen to make the most of Allied airpower which by 1944, had become overwhelming [371] Churchill never lost his apprehension about the invasion, and underwent mood fluctuation as D-Day approached Jenkins says he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier [372]\n\n\nNeed for post-war reform\nChurchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms The Beveridge Report with its five \"Giant Evils\" was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid popular acclaim [373] Even so, Churchill spent most of his focus on the war, and saw reform in terms of tidying up His attitude was demonstrated in a radio broadcast on 26 March 1944 He was obliged to devote most of it to reform and showed a distinct lack of interest Colville said Churchill had broadcast \"indifferently\" and Harold Nicolson said that, to many people, Churchill came across the air as \"a worn and petulant old man\" [374] In the end, however, it was demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge Attlee, Bevin and Labour's other coalition ministers, were seen as working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate [375] [376]\n\n\nDefeat of Germany: June 1944 to May 1945\nChurchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day (6 June 1944) or at least D-Day+1 His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF, until he was effectively vetoed by the King Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but fewer than 8,000 died in all of June [377] He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was five miles inland That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched On 22–23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour [378]\n\n\nD-Day: Allied invasion of Normandy\nChurchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day (6 June 1944) or at least D-Day+1 His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF, until he was effectively vetoed by the King Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but fewer than 8,000 died in all of June [377] He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was five miles inland That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched On 22–23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour [378]\n\n\nQuebec Conference, September 1944\nChurchill met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944 They reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise, but de-industrialise Eden opposed it and was able to persuade Churchill to disown it US Secretary of State Cordell Hull opposed it and convinced Roosevelt it was infeasible [379]\n\n\nMoscow Conference, October 1944\nAt the fourth Moscow conference in October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called \"Percentages agreement\" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans [380] By then, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, \"get at cross-purposes in small ways\" [381] He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it The agreement was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria The United Kingdom and United States would have 90% control of Greece Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each [382] In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in The Second World War), Soviet authorities denied Stalin had accepted such an \"imperialist proposal\" [380]\n\n\nYalta Conference, February 1945\nFrom 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt met for their Malta Conference ahead of the second \"Big Three\" event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February [383] Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland's post-war status, which Churchill saw as a test case for Eastern Europe [384] Churchill faced criticism for the agreement on Poland For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month Jenkins, however, maintains that Churchill did as well as possible in difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support [385]\n\n\nArea bombing controversy\nOn the nights of 13–15 February 1945, 1,200 British and US bombers attacked Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front [388] [389] The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war [390] Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll of about 24,000 [391] On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing [392] and sent a memo to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee: [393] [394]\n\n\nVE Day (Victory in Europe Day)\nOn 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germany's surrender The next day was Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) when Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night [396] Churchill went to Buckingham Palace where he appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens He went from the palace to Whitehall where he addressed another large crowd: \"God bless you all This is your victory In our long history, we have never seen a greater day than this Everyone, man or woman, has done their best\" [397]\n\n\nOperation Unthinkable\nIn May 1945, Winston Churchill commissioned the Chiefs of Staff Committee to provide its thoughts on a possible military campaign against the USSR, code-named Operation Unthinkable [400] One plan involved a surprise attack on Soviet troops stationed in Germany to impose \"the will of the United States and the British Empire\" on the Soviets [401] The hypothetical start date for the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was set for 1 July 1945 [401]\n\n\nCaretaker government: May 1945 to July 1945\nWith a general election looming, and with Labour ministers refusing to continue the coalition, Churchill resigned as prime minister on 23 May 1945 Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the National Government but sometimes called the caretaker ministry It contained Conservatives, National Liberals and a few non-party figures such as Sir John Anderson and Lord Woolton, but not Labour or Archibald Sinclair's Official Liberals Churchill was formally reappointed on 28 May [402] [403]\n\n\nPotsdam Conference\nChurchill was Great Britain's representative at the Potsdam Conference when it opened on 17 July and was accompanied at its sessions by Eden and Attlee They attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to England for their election counts After the landslide Labour victory, Attlee returned with Bevin as the new Foreign Secretary and there were five days of discussion [404] Potsdam went badly for Churchill Eden later described his performance as \"appalling\", saying he was unprepared and verbose Churchill upset the Chinese, exasperated the Americans and was easily led by Stalin, whom he was supposed to be resisting [405]\n\n\nGeneral election, July 1945\nChurchill mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate Labour [406] On 4 June, he committed a serious gaffe by saying in a radio broadcast that a Labour government would require \"some form of Gestapo\" to enforce its agenda [407] [408] It backfired and Attlee made political capital by saying in his reply broadcast next day: \"The voice we heard last night was that of Mr Churchill, but the mind was that of Lord Beaverbrook\" Jenkins says that this broadcast was \"the making of Attlee\" [409]\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition: 1945–1951\nChurchill continued to lead the Conservative Party and served as Leader of the Opposition In 1946, he was in America from early January to late March [419] It was on this trip he gave his \"Iron Curtain\" speech about the USSR and its creation of the Eastern Bloc [420] Speaking on 5 March 1946 in the company of President Truman at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill declared: [421]\n\n\n\"Iron Curtain\" speech\nChurchill continued to lead the Conservative Party and served as Leader of the Opposition In 1946, he was in America from early January to late March [419] It was on this trip he gave his \"Iron Curtain\" speech about the USSR and its creation of the Eastern Bloc [420] Speaking on 5 March 1946 in the company of President Truman at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill declared: [421]\n\n\nEuropean politics\nChurchill was an early proponent of pan-Europeanism, having called for a \"United States of Europe\" in a 1930 article He supported the creations of the Council of Europe in 1949 and the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, but his support was always with the firm proviso that Britain must not actually join any federal grouping [423] [424] [425]\n\n\nIreland\nHaving lived in Ireland as a child, Churchill always opposed its partition As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921, he suggested that Ulster should be part of a united Ireland, but with a degree of autonomy from an independent Irish government He was always opposed on this by Ulster Unionists [426] While he was Leader of the Opposition, he told John Dulanty and Frederick Boland, successive Irish ambassadors to London, that he still hoped for reunification [427]\n\n\n1950 and 1951 Elections\nLabour won the 1950 general election, but with a much-reduced majority [428] A fresh election was called the following year and the Conservatives won a majority.\n\n\nPrime Minister: 1951–1955\nDespite losing the popular vote, the Conservatives won a majority of 17 seats in the October 1951 general election and Churchill became prime minister, remaining in office until his resignation on 5 April 1955 [429] Eden, his eventual successor, was restored to Foreign Affairs [430] Future prime minister Harold Macmillan was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government with a manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses per year, Churchill's only real domestic concern He achieved the target and, in 1954, was promoted to Minister of Defence [431]\n\n\nElection result and cabinet appointments\nDespite losing the popular vote, the Conservatives won a majority of 17 seats in the October 1951 general election and Churchill became prime minister, remaining in office until his resignation on 5 April 1955 [429] Eden, his eventual successor, was restored to Foreign Affairs [430] Future prime minister Harold Macmillan was appointed Minister of Housing and Local Government with a manifesto commitment to build 300,000 new houses per year, Churchill's only real domestic concern He achieved the target and, in 1954, was promoted to Minister of Defence [431]\n\n\nHealth issues to eventual resignation\nChurchill was nearly 77 when he took office and not in good health following minor strokes [432] By December 1951, George VI had become concerned about Churchill's decline and intended asking him to stand down in favour of Eden, but the King had his own health issues and died on 6 February 1952 [433] Churchill developed a friendship with Elizabeth II and, in spring 1953, accepted the Order of the Garter at her request [434] He was knighted as Sir Winston on 24 April 1953 [435] It was widely expected he would retire after the Queen's Coronation in June 1953 but, after Eden became seriously ill, Churchill increased his own responsibilities by taking over at the Foreign Office [436] [437] [438] Eden was incapacitated until the end of the year and never completely well again [439] On the evening of 23 June 1953, Churchill suffered a serious stroke; the matter was kept secret and Churchill went to Chartwell to recuperate He had recovered by November [440] [441] [442] He retired in April 1955 and was succeeded by Eden [443]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nChurchill feared a global conflagration and firmly believed the only way to preserve peace and freedom was friendship and co-operation between Britain and America He made four official transatlantic visits from January 1952 to July 1954 [444] He enjoyed a good relationship with Truman, but difficulties arose over the planned European Defence Community (EDC), by which Truman hoped to reduce America's military presence in West Germany [445] Churchill wanted US military support of British interests in Egypt and the Middle East, but while Truman expected British military involvement in Korea, he viewed any US commitment to the Middle East as maintaining British imperialism [446] The Americans recognised the British Empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the Attlee government's policy of decolonisation Churchill believed Britain's position as a world power depended on the empire's continued existence [447]\n\n\nLater life: 1955–1965\nElizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of Randolph, who would have inherited the title [458] Although publicly supportive, Churchill was privately scathing about Eden's handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of his visits to the US in the following years were attempts to repair Anglo-American relations [459]\n\n\nRetirement: 1955–1964\nElizabeth II offered to create Churchill Duke of London, but he declined because of the objections of Randolph, who would have inherited the title [458] Although publicly supportive, Churchill was privately scathing about Eden's handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of his visits to the US in the following years were attempts to repair Anglo-American relations [459]\n\n\nDeath, funeral and memorials\nChurchill suffered his final stroke on 10 January 1965 and died on 24 January [460] [463] Like the Duke of Wellington in 1852 and William Gladstone in 1898, Churchill was given a state funeral [460]  His coffin lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days The funeral ceremony was at St Paul's Cathedral on 30 January [460] [463] Afterwards, the coffin was taken by boat along the River Thames to Waterloo Station and from there by a special train to the family plot at St Martin's Church, Bladon [464] [463]\n\n\nArtist, historian, and writer\nChurchill was a prolific writer His output included a novel (Savrola), two biographies, memoirs, histories, and press articles Two of his most famous works were his six-volume memoir, The Second World War, and the four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples [472] In recognition of his \"mastery of historical and biographical description\" and oratorial output, Churchill received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 [473]\n\n\nLegacy and assessments\nJenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising: [464]\n\n\n\"A man of destiny\"\nJenkins concludes his biography of Churchill by comparing him favourably with William Gladstone and summarising: [464]\n\n\nPolitical ideology\nDefunct\n\n\nImperialism and racial views\nChurchill was a staunch imperialist and monarchist, and consistently exhibited a \"romanticised view\" of the British Empire and reigning monarch, especially during his last term as premier [511] [512] [513] Churchill has been described as a \"liberal imperialist\" [514] who saw British imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited its subject peoples [515] He advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing the British Empire maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies [345]\n\n\nCultural depictions\nWhile biographies by Addison, Gilbert, Jenkins and Rhodes James are among the most acclaimed works about Churchill, he has been the subject of

The Little Mermaid is fascinated by the world above the sea, and human beings, and keeps a statue of a human boy in her garden in the palace. Lonely and feeling isolated from her family, she yearns to explore the world above, and constantly asks her grandmother to tell her stories of humans.\n\nAs the Little Mermaid grows older, her desire to experience life on land becomes more intense. She is drawn to the world above the waves, where humans live, love, and laugh. She longs to walk on two legs, to feel the warmth of the sun on her skin, and to explore the vast expanse of the ocean's surface.

\"sterrato\" Tomasz Marczyński did not start (DNS) the stage due to struggling with post-covid symptoms There were several attacks throughout the stage including stage winners Mäder and Lafay trying to get an escape started, then thirty kilometres into stage another attempt was made but UAE Team Emirates missed getting a rider into the group and therefore worked at the front of the peloton to bring the group back before they ever had the chance to get away It started raining again and more escape attempts came, including a final group of 17 riders, which teams FDJ and Ineos rode to control at the front of the main field Mäder took mountains points early in the day to defend his jersey, but by the end of the stage Geoffrey Bouchard would overtake him and wouldn't relinquish the mountains jersey for the rest of the Giro In the end the GC riders would fight it out for the win Gianni Moscon and Dani Martinez rode strongly for Ineos, setting the pace for Egan Bernal As the end of the stage approached, the gravel section, the final escapees included Mollema of Trek and Michael Storer of DSM chasing the duo of Koen Bouwman riding for Jumbo-Visma and Bouchard of AG2R With 500 metres to go Vlasov made an attack from the GC group which only Bernal and Ciccone answered Bernal then put his stamp of authority on the race [25] by attacking again which Ciccone answered briefly and with 400 metres to go they passed the final breakaway riders like they were standing still Bernal kept the pressure on and crossed the line solo seven seconds ahead of Vlasov and Ciccone A few seconds later Evenepoel and Martin crossed and two seconds behind them was a group including Almeida, Martinez, Damiano Caruso and Romain Bardet Valter was dropped and lost the pink jersey to Bernal, but it was late in the stage and he still clung to the top 5 behind Ciccone, Vlasov and Evenepoel During the stage Matej Mohorič was involved in a serious crash when he hit a crack in the road and was violently thrown over his handlebars as the front wheel completely broke off his bike He hit his head with force, but never lost consciousness and only abandoned the race due to the insistence of team medical staff.\n\n\nThe High Mountains and Third Week\nNeither Dylan Groenewegen nor David Dekker started stage 14 as a result of tactical decisions made by the management of Team Jumbo–Visma before the start of the race For Dekker it was because this was the first time in his career he had raced every day for two straight weeks and the elite sprinter Groenewegen was just coming back after a considerable absence from racing [29] GC contender Jai Hindley also did not start the stage The stage began with the first 130 kilometres or so being mostly flat and a breakaway group got a gap of just under nine minutes Astana–Premier Tech put in a lot of the work at the front of the main field and was attempting to get Aleksandr Vlasov in a good position for the upcoming climb on Monte Zoncolan Edoardo Affini and Jacopo Mosca put in a great deal of work at the front of the breakaway group in an attempt to get their teammates George Bennett and Bauke Mollema the opportunity to go for the stage win The group still had a gap of about 6 minutes as the Zoncolan began Jan Tratnik attacked the breakaway group and only Lorenzo Fortunato eventually made the move to go with him although Alessandro Covi, Bennett and Mollema were not far behind initially In the end Fortunato beat Tratnik to the line by about thirty seconds to claim the stage win In the GC situation, the most important attack of the day came from Simon Yates, which no one could initially answer [30] Egan Bernal eventually went after him and passed him Bernal crossed the finish line in 4th place, gaining 11 seconds on Yates and more than that on everyone else In the overall situation he now led Yates in 2nd place by +1:33 and Damiano Caruso in 3rd place by +1:51 Vlasov fell to 4th and he was followed by Carthy, Buchmann, Ciccone and Remco Evenepoel who held on to remain in 8th place at +3:52 9th place was now occupied by Bernal's teammate Dani Martínez, who was proving himself to be the strongest

It is situated in the Panjshir Province, approximately 95 kilometers (59 miles) northeast of the capital city, Kabul. The valley is nestled in the Hindu Kush mountain range, and its unique geography has made it a strategic and culturally significant region in the country.\n\n**History**\n\nHuman activity in Panjshir can be dated to the Bronze Age. Archaeological excavations have uncovered relics from underground sites, which were discovered during the presidency of President Daoud Khan. The indigenous people of the valley are believed to be the most ancient living inhabitants in the country. For centuries, the valley has been inhabited by various ethnic groups, including the Panjshiri people, who are known for their bravery and resilience.\n\nThe valley has played a significant role in Afghan history, with various empires and dynasties vying for control over the region. During the Middle Ages, Panjshir was a major center of silver mining, and the Saffarids and Samanids minted their coins in the valley. The valley was also a key location for the ancient Silk Road, a network of trade routes that connected East Asia with the Mediterranean region.\n\n**Economy and Natural Resources**\n\nThe Panjshir Valley has the potential to become a major center of emerald mining. Emeralds have been mined in the valley for centuries, and the region is believed to have some of the finest emeralds in the world. In the 1st century AD, the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder commented on the gemstones found in the region, which were highly prized for their beauty and rarity.\n\nAs of 1985, emeralds upwards of 190 carats (38 grams) had been found in Panjshir, which were reported to rival the finest crystals of the Muzo mine in Colombia. The valley has also been known for its silver mining, and the Saffarids and Samanids minted their coins in the valley during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn recent years, American reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan have sparked a development boom in the valley. The construction of new modern roads and a new radio tower has allowed valley residents to pick up radio signals from the Afghan capital, Kabul. The valley has the potential to become an energy hub for Afghanistan, with the construction of several hydroelectric dams.\n\nRewat locality is believed to be the site of the first dam, which would provide electricity to the valley and make the capital region power self-reliant. The dam would also create new economic opportunities for the valley's residents, who would be able to sell their surplus energy to other regions in the country.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Panjshir Valley is a unique and culturally significant region in Afghanistan. With its rich history, diverse geography, and natural resources, the valley has the potential to become a major center of emerald mining and a key location for the country's energy needs. As the valley continues to develop and grow, it is likely to become an important contributor to the country's economic and social development.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Panjshir_Valley\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nHuman activity in Panjshir can be dated to the Bronze Age The relics from underground archaeological sites had been discovered during President Daoud Khan's presidency The indigenous people of the valley are believed to be  the most ancient living inhabitants in the country.\n\n\nEconomy and natural resources\nThe Panjshir Valley has the potential to become a major centre of emerald mining As early as the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder commented on gemstones from the region [21] In the Middle Ages, Panjshir was famed for its silver mining and the Saffarids and Samanids minted their coins there [22] As of 1985, emeralds upwards of 190 carats (38 g) had been found in Panjshir, reported to rival in quality the finest crystals of the Muzo mine in Colombia [21] American reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan sparked a development boom in the valley with the construction of new modern roads and a new radio tower that allows valley residents to pick up radio signals from the Afghan capital, Kabul [23] The valley has the potential of being an energy hub for Afghanistan, through construction of several hydroelectric dams Rewat locality could be the site of the first dam The valley could make the capital region power self-reliant.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The office of the prime minister was created in 1947, following the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan. The prime minister is the chief executive of the Government of Pakistan and exercises the authority of the country's administration.\n\nHistory\n\nThe office of the prime minister was created on immediate effect after the partition and the establishment of Pakistan in 1947. The first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, exercised central executive powers until his assassination in 1951. The powers slowly began to be reduced as a result of constant intervention by the governor-general. Despite the first set of the Constitution giving central power in 1956, the next six prime ministers were dismissed by the governor-general from 1951 till 1957. The first set of the Constitution had evolved the governor-general into the president of Pakistan whilst declaring the country an \"Islamic republic\". In 1958, President Iskandar Mirza dismissed the seventh prime minister to impose martial law in a mere two weeks. President Mirza was ousted by army chief General Ayub Khan who had for a brief period held the post of prime minister.\n\nConstitutional Law\n\nThe Constitution of Pakistan gives the prime minister a significant role in the country's administration. Article 91 of the Constitution states that the prime minister shall be appointed by the president in consultation with the leader of the party or coalition having the majority in the National Assembly. The prime minister is also responsible for advising the president on matters of national importance and for representing the country in international forums.\n\nAzad Kashmir Government\n\nThe Azad Kashmir government is a semi-autonomous government that governs the region of Azad Kashmir. The government is headed by a prime minister who is elected by the Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly. The prime minister of Azad Kashmir has a significant role in the administration of the region and is responsible for advising the president of Pakistan on matters related to the region.\n\nRole and Powers\n\nThe principal workplace of the prime minister is the Prime Minister's Office located in northeast Islamabad. The official residence, known as Prime Minister Enclave, is near the Prime Minister's Office. The prime minister is the chief executive who heads and exercises the authority of the Government of Pakistan. After obtaining a vote of confidence, the prime minister is invited by the president to take the oath of office and form the government. In practice, the prime minister nominates the members of the Cabinet who supervise the important functions and ministries of the Government of Pakistan. The prime minister also communicates to the president all decisions of the Cabinet relating to the administration of affairs of state and proposals for legislation.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe Constitution of Pakistan requires that the prime minister be a member of the National Assembly. As well as this, one must be a citizen of Pakistan, at least 25 years old, and have not been impeached or convicted of any offense. The prime minister must also be a person of good character and have a good understanding of the Constitution and the laws of Pakistan.\n\nSelection and Removal\n\nThe candidates for the prime minister are members of the National Assembly who were chosen through direct elections by popular vote following campaigning on the party platforms. Usually, the leader of the majority party in the parliament retains the office of prime minister, and forms the government either by coalition or by simple majority. The candidate must retain the vote of confidence of the members of the parliament before being invited by the president to form the government.\n\nOath of Office\n\nThe prime minister is required to make and subscribe to, in the presence of the president, an oath or affirmation that they shall protect, preserve and defend the Constitution. The oath is as follows:\n\n\"I, (name of the prime minister), do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impartially discharge my duties as Prime Minister of Pakistan, and that I will not, directly or indirectly, accept or receive any gift, gratification, or benefit from anyone, which may influence my decisions or actions as Prime Minister. I will not be a party to, or condone, any act of corruption or mismanagement of public funds. I will protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of Pakistan, and will not take any action that may undermine the sovereignty and integrity of the country. I will faithfully carry out my duties as Prime Minister, and will not engage in any activity that may bring disrepute to the office of the Prime Minister or undermine the trust and confidence of the public.\"\n\nSee Also\n\n* List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan\n* List of Governors-General of Pakistan\n* List of Presidents of Pakistan\n\nNotes\n\n* The office of the prime minister was created in 1947, following the partition of India and the establishment of Pakistan.\n* The first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, exercised central executive powers until his assassination in 1951.\n* The powers slowly began to be reduced as a result of constant intervention by the governor-general.\n* Despite the first set of the Constitution giving central power in 1956, the next six prime ministers were dismissed by the governor-general from 1951 till 1957.\n* The Constitution of Pakistan gives the prime minister a significant role in the country's administration.\n\nReferences\n\n* Constitution of Pakistan, Article 91\n* Constitution of Pakistan, Article 92\n* Constitution of Pakistan, Article 93\n* Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting\n* Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Interior\n\nFurther Reading\n\n* Khan, Liaquat Ali. \"Pakistan's Future\".
