This region is characterized by a warm and subtropical climate, and it has experienced significant population growth and economic development over the past several decades.\n\n# Migration\nThe Sun Belt has been a major destination for migrants from the Northeast and Midwest since the mid-20th century. This migration was driven by a combination of factors, including the growth of the sunbelt region's economy, the expansion of the interstate highway system, and the availability of affordable housing. Many migrants were attracted to the Sun Belt's warm climate, lower cost of living, and growing job opportunities.\n\nThe migration to the Sun Belt was particularly pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s, as millions of Americans left the Northeast and Midwest to seek better economic opportunities in the South and West. This migration was often referred to as the \"Great Migration\" and was driven by the growth of the defense industry, the expansion of the Interstate Highway System, and the availability of affordable housing.\n\nThe Sun Belt's population grew from approximately 40 million in 1950 to over 100 million by the end of the 20th century. This growth was driven by a combination of natural increase (births minus deaths) and migration. The region's population growth was particularly pronounced in states such as Florida, California, and Texas, which experienced some of the fastest population growth rates in the country.\n\n# Definition\nThe Sun Belt is a region that encompasses the southeastern and southwestern states of the United States. It includes states such as Florida, California, Arizona, Texas, and Georgia, among others. The region is characterized by a warm and subtropical climate, with mild winters and hot summers.\n\nThe Sun Belt is often defined as the region south of the Mason-Dixon line, which separates the northern states from the southern states. However, the region extends beyond the Mason-Dixon line and includes parts of the Southwest, which is characterized by a desert climate.\n\nThe Sun Belt is also defined by its economic and cultural characteristics, including a strong emphasis on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. The region is home to a diverse range of industries, including technology, healthcare, and finance. The Sun Belt is also known for its rich cultural heritage, including its music, art, and cuisine.\n\n# Projections\nThe Sun Belt is expected to continue to grow and develop in the coming decades. The region's population is projected to grow from over 100 million in 2020 to over 150 million by 2050. This growth is driven by a combination of natural increase and migration, as well as the expansion of the region's economy and infrastructure.\n\nThe Sun Belt is expected to be a major driver of economic growth in the United States, with many experts predicting that the region will continue to attract businesses and investment from around the world. The region's ports, airports, and transportation infrastructure are expected to be major hubs for international trade and commerce.\n\nThe Sun Belt is also expected to play a key role in the development of new technologies, including renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. The region is home to many of the world's leading research universities and institutions, and is expected to be a major center for innovation and entrepreneurship in the coming decades.\n\n# Politics\nThe Sun Belt is a region with a diverse range of politics and ideologies. The region is home to many conservative and liberal states, as well as a significant number of swing states. Many of the Sun Belt states are characterized by a strong emphasis on individual rights and limited government, while others have a more progressive and social welfare-oriented approach to governance.\n\nThe Sun Belt has been a key battleground state in many presidential elections, with many of the region's states being closely contested. The region's politicians have often been known for their strong conservative and libertarian views, although there are also many progressive and liberal politicians in the region.\n\nThe Sun Belt has been a key player in the development of many of the country's major social and economic policies, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The region has also been a major center for the development of many of the country's leading industries, including technology and healthcare.\n\n# Environment\nThe Sun Belt is a region with a diverse range of environmental characteristics, including deserts, forests, wetlands, and coastlines. The region is home to many of the country's most iconic and endangered species, including the Florida panther, the California condor, and the gila monster.\n\nThe Sun Belt is also a region that is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense natural disasters, and droughts. The region's coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise, which is expected to increase the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.\n\nThe Sun Belt is also home to many of the country's leading environmental initiatives, including the Everglades Restoration Project and the California Desert Conservation Area. The region is also a major center for the development of renewable energy, including solar and wind power.\n\n# Major cities\nThe Sun Belt is home to many of the country's largest and most influential cities, including:\n\n* Miami, Florida: A major hub for international trade and commerce, known for its vibrant arts and cultural scene.\n* Los Angeles, California: A global center for the entertainment and technology industries, known for its iconic beaches and diverse cultural heritage.\n* San Francisco, California: A major financial and technology hub, known for its iconic Golden Gate Bridge and vibrant arts and cultural scene.\n* Dallas, Texas: A major center for the energy industry, known for its vibrant arts and cultural scene and diverse cuisine.\n* Phoenix, Arizona: A major hub for the technology and healthcare industries, known for its vibrant arts and cultural scene and diverse cuisine.\n\nThese cities are hubs for innovation, entrepreneurship, and cultural expression, and are major drivers of the Sun Belt's economic and cultural growth.\n\n# See also\n* Great Migration\n* Sun Belt states\n* Southeastern United States\n* Southwestern United States\n* American Southwest\n* Sun Belt economy\n* Sun Belt politics\n* Sun Belt culture\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of the Sun Belt region and does not include specific information on each individual state.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sun_Belt\" following this outline:\n\n#Migration\n#Definition\n#Projections\n#Politics\n#Environment\n#Major cities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin, the two largest parties in the assembly, had been in a power-sharing executive since 2020. However, the parties had struggled to agree on key issues, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had led to a collapse in the executive.\n\n### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol was a key issue in the 2022 election. The protocol, which was agreed as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, created a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUP had long opposed the protocol, arguing that it undermined the integrity of the United Kingdom and created economic and trade barriers for Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, had supported the protocol, arguing that it helped to maintain the Good Friday Agreement and prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n### Calls for early election\n\nThe 2022 election was called by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, after the previous assembly's term expired in January 2022. However, there were calls for an early election to be held in 2021, following the collapse of the executive in April 2021. The DUP and Sinn Féin had been unable to agree on a new executive, and the parties had argued over the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 1,228 candidates stood in the 2022 election, including 855 men and 373 women. The largest number of candidates stood in the Belfast West constituency, where 27 candidates contested the seat. The smallest number of candidates stood in the Strangford constituency, where 14 candidates contested the seat.\n\n**Members not seeking re-election**\n\nA total of 29 members of the previous assembly did not seek re-election in 2022. The largest number of members not seeking re-election came from the DUP, with 13 members choosing not to stand again. The Sinn Féin party had 7 members not seeking re-election, while the Alliance Party had 3 members not seeking re-election.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2022 election campaign was marked by controversy and debate over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP had argued that the protocol was a threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom, while Sinn Féin had argued that it helped to maintain the Good Friday Agreement. The parties had also argued over issues such as healthcare and education.\n\nThe campaign was also marked by a lack of clear policy differences between the parties. The DUP and Sinn Féin had both campaigned on a platform of opposing the Northern Ireland Protocol, while the Alliance Party had campaigned on a platform of supporting the protocol. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) had campaigned on a platform of supporting the protocol, while also opposing the DUP's hardline stance on the issue.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nA number of opinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the 2022 election. A poll conducted by LucidTalk in April 2022 found that the DUP was on course to win the most seats in the election, with 25% of the vote. Sinn Féin was in second place, with 22% of the vote, while the Alliance Party was in third place, with 12% of the vote. A poll conducted by BMG Research in May 2022 found that the DUP was on course to win 28 seats in the election, with Sinn Féin winning 24 seats and the Alliance Party winning 10 seats.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe 2022 election was marked by a significant shift in the balance of power in the assembly. The DUP and Sinn Féin, which had long dominated the assembly, were both reduced in size. The Alliance Party, which had campaigned on a platform of supporting the Northern Ireland Protocol, made significant gains, winning 17 seats in the election.\n\n### Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe results of the 2022 election were as follows:\n\n* Belfast East: DUP 2, Alliance 2\n* Belfast North: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 1, Alliance 1\n* Belfast South: Sinn Féin 2, Alliance 1, DUP 1\n* Belfast West: Sinn Féin 3, DUP 1, Alliance 1\n* East Antrim: DUP 2, Ulster Unionist 1\n* East Belfast: DUP 2, Alliance 1\n* East Londonderry: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 1\n* Fermanagh and South Tyrone: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* Foyle: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* Mid Ulster: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* Newry and Armagh: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* North Antrim: DUP 3, Sinn Féin 1\n* North Belfast: DUP 2, Sinn Féin 1, Alliance 1\n* North Down and Ards: Alliance 2, DUP 1\n* South Antrim: DUP 2, Ulster Unionist 1\n* South Belfast: Sinn Féin 2, Alliance 1, DUP 1\n* South Down: Sinn Féin 2, DUP 1\n* Strangford: DUP 2, Ulster Unionist 1\n\n### Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows:\n\n* DUP: 24.1%\n* Sinn Féin: 22.6%\n* Alliance: 12.8%\n* Ulster Unionist: 4.1%\n* Green Party: 2.4%\n* People Before Profit: 2.1%\n* Traditional Unionist Voice: 1.8%\n* NI People's Forum: 1.1%\n* Socialist Party: 1.1%\n* Workers' Party: 0.7%\n* Aontú: 0.5%\n\n### Incumbents defeated\n\nA number of incumbents were defeated in the 2022 election. These included:\n\n* Arlene Foster, former First Minster\n* Michelle O'Neill, former Deputy First Minster\n* Sammy Wilson, DUP MLA\n* Jim Allister, Traditional Unionist Voice MLA\n* David Ford, Alliance MLA\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2022 election resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power in the assembly. The DUP and Sinn Féin, which had long dominated the assembly, were both reduced in size. The Alliance Party, which had campaigned on a platform of supporting the Northern Ireland Protocol, made significant gains, winning 17 seats in the election.\n\nThe election was marked by controversy and debate over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP had argued that the protocol was a threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom, while Sinn Féin had argued that it helped to maintain the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe result of the election has significant implications for the future of Northern Ireland. The Alliance Party's gains are likely to give the party a stronger voice in the assembly, and may lead to changes in the way that the assembly operates.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly\n* 1998 Good Friday Agreement\n* Brexit\n* Northern Ireland Protocol\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* \n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Electoral Office for Northern Ireland\n* BBC Northern Ireland Election 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the premier international Twenty20 (T20) competition in men's cricket, with the top national teams from around the world participating.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup was first held in 2007 in South Africa, and has since become one of the most popular and highly anticipated sporting events globally. The tournament has undergone significant changes and expansions over the years, with the latest edition featuring 16 teams competing in a knockout format. The tournament is considered a flagship event for the ICC, attracting massive audiences and generating significant revenue for the sport.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe concept of the T20 format originated in England in 2003, with the first T20 match played between Durham and Nottinghamshire.

The knockout stage features a semifinal, a third-place match, and a final.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe trophy awarded to the winner of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup is the ICC T20 World Cup trophy.

This procedure is typically performed on individuals with vision loss due to cataracts, which are a natural part of aging, as well as those with certain eye injuries or diseases.\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is primarily used to restore vision in individuals with cataracts. The procedure is also used in cases where cataracts are causing other eye problems, such as glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, cataract surgery may be performed as part of other eye surgeries, such as corneal transplants or retinal detachment repairs.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including:\n\n* Phacoemulsification: a modern technique that uses ultrasonic waves to break up the cataractous lens, which is then removed through a small incision in the cornea.\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS): a technique that involves manually removing the cataractous lens through a small incision in the cornea.\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE): a technique that involves removing the cataractous lens in one piece, along with its surrounding capsule.\n* Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency: a technique used when the phacoemulsification or MSICS procedure is interrupted due to complications, and the surgeon decides to convert to ECCE.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, a thorough pre-operative evaluation is performed to assess the patient's overall health and eye condition. This evaluation includes:\n\n### **Contraindications**\n\nCertain conditions may contraindicate cataract surgery, including:\n\n* Severe ocular surface disease\n* Uncontrolled glaucoma\n* Active uveitis or other inflammatory conditions\n* Severe dry eye\n* Previous eye surgery with complications\n\n### **Selection of intraocular lenses**\n\nThe type of IOL used in cataract surgery depends on the patient's refractive error, eye condition, and other factors. Common types of IOLs include:\n\n* Monofocal IOLs: designed to correct distance vision\n* Multifocal IOLs: designed to correct both distance and near vision\n* Toric IOLs: designed to correct astigmatism\n* Accommodating IOLs: designed to move with the eye and provide a range of vision\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\nCataract surgery is typically performed under local anesthesia, and the procedure involves several steps:\n\n### **Preparation**\n\nThe patient is prepared for surgery by disinfecting the eye and applying a local anesthetic. The surgeon then makes a small incision in the cornea to access the lens.\n\n### **Anaesthesia**\n\nThe patient is administered local anesthesia to numb the eye, which may be in the form of eye drops, injections, or a combination of both.\n\n### **Phacoemulsification**\n\nThe cataractous lens is broken up using ultrasonic waves, which are emitted by a phacoemulsification probe. The lens is then aspirated out of the eye using a small cannula.\n\n### **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**\n\nThe cataractous lens is manually removed through a small incision in the cornea using a specialized instrument called a keratome.\n\n### **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**\n\nThe cataractous lens is removed in one piece, along with its surrounding capsule, through a larger incision in the cornea.\n\n### **Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency**\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE if the phacoemulsification or MSICS procedure is interrupted due to complications.\n\n### **Closing the wound**\n\nThe incision is closed using sutures or other closure devices to minimize scarring and promote healing.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, the patient is monitored for any signs of complications and provided with post-operative care instructions. This may include:\n\n* Eye drops to reduce inflammation and promote healing\n* Antibiotics to prevent infection\n* Pain medication to manage discomfort\n* Follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications can occur during or after cataract surgery, including:\n\n### **During surgery**\n\n* Intraocular pressure spikes\n* Corneal edema\n* Retinal detachment\n* Cataract extraction errors\n\n### **After surgery**\n\n* Post-operative endophthalmitis\n* Cystoid macular edema\n* Glaucoma\n* Uveitis\n\n### **Risk**\n\nThe risk of complications during or after cataract surgery is low, but it is essential to discuss the potential risks with your surgeon before undergoing the procedure.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nThe recovery and rehabilitation process after cataract surgery typically involves:\n\n* Post-operative care instructions\n* Follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress\n* Eye exercises to promote healing and reduce the risk of complications\n* Refractive correction, such as glasses or contact lenses, to optimize vision\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are typically excellent, with most patients experiencing significant improvements in vision. The outcomes may vary depending on the patient's eye condition, the type of IOL used, and other factors.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. The modern cataract surgery techniques were developed in the 20th century, and the procedure has undergone significant advancements since then.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n### **Europe**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having a high standard of eye care and cataract surgery services.\n\n### **Asia**\n\nCataract surgery is also widely available in Asia, with many countries having a high demand for cataract surgery services.\n\n### **Africa**\n\nCataract surgery is available in many African countries, although the availability and quality of services may vary.\n\n### **Latin America**\n\nCataract surgery is also available in many Latin American countries, although the availability and quality of services may vary.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, including:\n\n* Improving vision and quality of life for individuals with cataracts\n* Reducing the economic burden of cataract-related vision loss\n* Promoting eye health and preventing eye diseases\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery may be performed on special populations, including:\n\n### **Congenital cataracts**\n\nCongenital cataracts are a rare condition where a child is born with a cataract. Cataract surgery may be performed to remove the cataract and restore vision.\n\n### **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**\n\nIndividuals with certain eye conditions or a history of eye surgery may be at higher risk for complications during or after cataract surgery.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery can be performed on other animals, including dogs and cats, to improve their vision and quality of life.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)\n* Cataract surgery complications\n* Cataract surgery outcomes\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Cataract surgery is a complex procedure that requires specialized training and expertise.\n* The outcomes of cataract surgery may vary depending on the patient's eye condition and other factors.\n* Cataract surgery is not a reversible procedure, and the IOL cannot be removed once it is implanted.\n\n**References**\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).

This phenomenon was a response to the economic and social chaos caused by the war, including shortages, rationing, and price controls. The black market was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involved various actors, including ordinary citizens, occupation forces, and the French Resistance.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: Inflation, Instability, and Unrest\n\nIn the 1930s, France experienced a period of economic instability, marked by high inflation, unemployment, and social unrest. The country was struggling to recover from the Great Depression, and the rise of extremist ideologies, including fascism and communism, was a growing concern. This precarious economic and social context laid the groundwork for the development of the black market in wartime France.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nThe fall of France in June 1940 marked a turning point in the country's history. The German occupation of Paris and the establishment of the Vichy regime created a power vacuum that allowed the black market to flourish. The Vichy government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, implemented a series of economic measures aimed at stabilizing the country and controlling the black market, but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe black market in France was born out of the need for ordinary citizens to access essential goods and services in a context of severe shortages and rationing. Several factors contributed to its emergence:\n\n#### Rationing and Price Controls\n\nThe Vichy government introduced a system of rationing and price controls in an attempt to manage the distribution of goods and services. However, these measures were often ineffective and created a black market in goods such as food, fuel, and basic household items.\n\n#### Diversion from Official Channels\n\nAs the black market grew, individuals and businesses began to divert goods and services from official channels to the black market. This diversion was facilitated by corruption, bribery, and the use of clandestine networks.\n\n#### Clandestine Networks\n\nClandestine networks, often linked to organized crime, played a significant role in the development of the black market. These networks smuggled goods into and out of the country, using complex routes and hiding places to evade detection.\n\n#### Hidden Stockpiling\n\nHouseholds and businesses began to stockpile goods in anticipation of shortages and price increases. This hidden stockpiling created a black market in goods such as food, fuel, and basic household items.\n\n#### Grey Market\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"parallel market,\" emerged as a response to the official rationing system. Individuals and businesses sold goods and services outside of the official channels, often at inflated prices.\n\n### Users of the Black Market\n\nThe black market in France was not limited to ordinary citizens. Several groups, including the occupation forces and the French Resistance, were also involved in the black market.\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe privileged French, including the wealthy and well-connected, were among the first to access the black market. They used their social connections and wealth to acquire goods and services that were scarce in the official market.\n\n#### Occupation Forces\n\nThe German occupation forces were also involved in the black market. They used their power and influence to acquire goods and services at discounted prices, often through corrupt means.\n\n### Public Response\n\nThe public response to the black market was complex and multifaceted. While many condemned the black market as immoral and unpatriotic, others saw it as a necessary response to the economic and social chaos caused by the war.\n\n#### Early Condemnation\n\nIn the early years of the occupation, the black market was widely condemned as a moral failing. The Vichy government and the French Resistance saw it as a threat to the national interest and a source of corruption.\n\n#### Participation\n\nAs the black market grew, more and more people began to participate. Ordinary citizens saw it as a way to access essential goods and services in a context of severe shortages and rationing.\n\n#### Housewives' Demonstrations\n\nHousewives, in particular, were vocal in their condemnation of the black market. They organized demonstrations and protests to highlight the shortage of basic household items and the impact of the black market on their lives.\n\n#### Suspicions of Hoarding\n\nAs the black market grew, there were increasing suspicions of hoarding. Many believed that individuals and businesses were stockpiling goods in anticipation of shortages and price increases, creating a black market in goods such as food, fuel, and basic household items.\n\n#### Official Antisemitism\n\nThe black market was also linked to official antisemitism. The Vichy government and the French Resistance saw the black market as a Jewish phenomenon, and many Jews were targeted as a result.\n\n#### Public Opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex and multifaceted. While many saw it as a necessary response to the economic and social chaos caused by the war, others condemned it as immoral and unpatriotic.\n\n#### Political Opposition\n\nThe black market was also a source of political opposition. The French Resistance and other opposition groups saw it as a threat to the national interest and a source of corruption.\n\n### Response by Authorities\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market with a combination of repression and reform. The Vichy government and the French Resistance implemented a series of measures aimed at controlling the black market, including price controls, rationing, and the establishment of a black market police force.\n\n#### Tacit Tolerance\n\nHowever, the authorities also tolerated the black market to some extent. They recognized that it was a necessary response to the economic and social chaos caused by the war, and that it could be used to undermine the German occupation.\n\n#### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nAs the black market grew, the authorities began to focus their enforcement efforts on specific areas, such as the smuggling of goods into and out of the country, and the use of clandestine networks.\n\n#### Metrics\n\nSeveral metrics were used to measure the extent of the black market. These included the proportion of production that was diverted to the black market, the higher and more volatile prices, the geographic distribution, and the beneficiaries.\n\n## Widespread Black Market (Autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\nThe black market in France reached its peak in the autumn of 1941 to 1943. This was a period of widespread shortages and rationing, and the black market became a necessary response for many ordinary citizens.\n\n### Agricultural Black Market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged as a response to the shortages of food and other essential goods. Farmers and agricultural workers began to sell their produce on the black market, often at inflated prices.\n\n### Grey Market: Direct Sales\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"parallel market,\" continued to grow. Individuals and businesses sold goods and services outside of the official channels, often at inflated prices.\n\n### Commerce and Industry\n\nThe black market also extended to commerce and industry. Businesses began to sell goods and services on the black market, often at inflated prices.\n\n### Tacit Tolerance\n\nThe authorities continued to tolerate the black market to some extent. They recognized that it was a necessary response to the economic and social chaos caused by the war, and that it could be used to undermine the German occupation.\n\n### No Longer Immoral\n\nHowever, the black market was no longer seen as immoral or unpatriotic. Many ordinary citizens saw it as a necessary response to the economic and social chaos caused by the war.\n\n### Nuanced and Refocused Enforcement\n\nAs the black market grew, the authorities began to focus their enforcement efforts on specific areas, such as the smuggling of goods into and out of the country, and the use of clandestine networks.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSeveral metrics were used to measure the extent of the black market. These included the proportion of production that was diverted to the black market, the higher and more volatile prices, the geographic distribution, and the beneficiaries.\n\n### Proportion of Production\n\nThe proportion of production that was diverted to the black market was estimated to be around 20-30%.\n\n### Higher and More Volatile Prices\n\nThe prices of goods on the black market were higher and more volatile than those in the official market.\n\n### Geographic Distribution\n\nThe black market was concentrated in urban areas, particularly in Paris and other major cities.\n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were varied, including ordinary citizens, businesses, and even the occupation forces.\n\n## Patriotism (Spring 1943-Summer 1944)\n\nThe black market in France reached its peak in the spring of 1943 to summer 1944. This was a period of widespread shortages and rationing, and the black market became a necessary response for many ordinary citizens.\n\n### Enforcement for the Occupiers\n\nThe authorities continued to enforce the black market, but their efforts were focused on the occupation forces.\n\n### Economic Pillage and the End of the German Black Market\n\nThe economic pillage and the end of the German black market had a significant impact on the French black market.\n\n### Countermeasures and Collaboration\n\nThe authorities implemented countermeasures and collaborated with the resistance to undermine the black market.\n\n### Milice vs the Black Market\n\nThe Milice, a paramilitary group established by the Vichy government, was tasked with combating the black market.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market was also linked to fraud and resistance. Many individuals and businesses used the black market to fund their resistance activities.\n\n### Resistance Encouragement\n\nThe authorities encouraged the resistance to use the black market to fund their activities.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nHowever, the authorities also blamed the resistance for the black market.\n\n### End of the Occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation marked the end of the black market in France.\n\n## After the Liberation (1944-1949)\n\nThe black market in France continued after the liberation, but it was no longer as widespread or as lucrative as it had been during the occupation.\n\n### Épuration and Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities implemented épuration, or purification, to confiscate illicit profits and punish those involved in the black market.\n\n### Pursuit and Punishment\n\nThe authorities pursued and punished those involved in the black market, including confiscating their assets and imposing prison sentences.\n\n### Confiscation of Illicit Profits\n\nThe authorities confiscated illicit profits from the black market, estimated to be around 100 billion francs.\n\n### Continued Black Market Operations\n\nHowever, the black market continued to operate, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\n### Continued Trafficking\n\nTrafficking continued, with goods being smuggled into and out of the country.\n\n### Generalized Fraud\n\nGeneralized fraud continued, with businesses and individuals engaging in various forms of deception and corruption.\n\n### Government Powerlessness\n\nThe government was powerless to stop the black market, despite its efforts to enforce the law.\n\n### Towards the Free Market\n\nThe black market marked a transition towards the free market, as the government gradually relaxed its controls and allowed the market to regulate itself.\n\n## Historical Memory\n\nThe black market in France during World War II is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has left a lasting impact on the

K. Rowling. It is the third installment in the Fantastic Beasts film series, a spin-off of the Harry Potter franchise, and serves as a prequel to the main series. The film takes place in the 1930s and follows the adventures of Magizoologist Newt Scamander and his friends as they uncover a dark plot threatening the wizarding world.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with an elderly Albus Dumbledore, played by Jude Law, who is now the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, retiring from his position as a professor. However, he is soon drawn into a mysterious plot involving the return of the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, played by Mads Mikkelsen. Grindelwald, who has escaped from his prison, has been secretly manipulating events to gain power and control over the wizarding world.\n\nNewt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, is recruited by Dumbledore to help unravel the mystery behind Grindelwald's return. Along with his friends, Jacob Kowalski, played by Dan Fogler, and Queenie Goldstein, played by Alison Sudol, Newt embarks on a perilous journey to stop Grindelwald and his followers. The trio must navigate the complexities of the wizarding world, encountering a range of magical creatures and obstacles along the way.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Grindelwald's plans are more sinister than initially thought, and that Dumbledore's past is more closely tied to the events unfolding than he initially lets on. The film builds towards a climactic confrontation between Newt and Grindelwald, with the fate of the wizarding world hanging in the balance.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* **Eddie Redmayne** as Newt Scamander: A magizoologist who is recruited by Dumbledore to help stop Grindelwald.\n* **Jude Law** as Albus Dumbledore: The Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and a key player in the events unfolding.\n* **Mads Mikkelsen** as Gellert Grindelwald: A dark wizard who has escaped from prison and is manipulating events to gain power.\n* **Dan Fogler** as Jacob Kowalski: A No-Maj who is a friend of Newt's and helps him in his quest.\n* **Alison Sudol** as Queenie Goldstein: A witch and a friend of Newt's who helps him in his quest.\n* **Jenna Haze** as Leta Lestrange: A witch who is a friend of Newt's and becomes embroiled in the events unfolding.\n* **Victoria Yeates** as Bunty Broadbent: A witch who is a friend of Newt's and helps him in his quest.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore was first announced in October 2020, with David Yates confirmed to direct and J.K.

The battle began in August 2022 and continued until June 2023, with both sides suffering significant losses and the city being repeatedly captured and recaptured.\n\n**Background**\n\nBakhmut is a strategically important city located in the Donetsk Oblast, approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) northwest of the city of Donetsk. The city has a population of around 70,000 people and is a major transportation hub, with several highways and railways passing through it. Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Bakhmut was a thriving industrial city, with a strong economy and a diverse population.\n\n**Battle**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut began in August 2022, when Russian forces launched a series of artillery strikes against the city. The strikes caused significant damage and displaced many residents. In response, Ukrainian forces mobilized troops and equipment to defend the city, but the Russian military maintained a significant advantage in terms of artillery and air power.\n\n### Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nIn the initial stages of the battle, Russian forces employed a combination of artillery and rocket strikes to weaken Ukrainian defenses. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, and many residents were forced to flee. Ukrainian forces attempted to counterattack, but were unable to make significant gains against the Russian military. By the end of October 2022, Russian forces had established a foothold on the outskirts of the city.\n\n### Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter set in, the battle for Bakhmut intensified. Russian forces launched a series of assaults on Ukrainian positions, using infantry, tanks, and artillery to try and break through the city's defenses. Ukrainian forces responded with their own artillery and air strikes, but the Russian military maintained a significant advantage in terms of manpower and equipment. By the end of December 2022, Russian forces had made significant gains, and the city was on the brink of collapse.\n\n### Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces captured the nearby city of Soledar, which gave them control of a strategic high ground that allowed them to shell Bakhmut from multiple directions. Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat from the city, but they continued to hold out in the surrounding countryside. By the end of April 2023, Russian forces had partially encircled the city, cutting off supply lines and forcing Ukrainian forces to fight on a narrow front.\n\n### Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks against Russian positions, hoping to break the encirclement and retake the city. The counterattacks were initially successful, and Ukrainian forces were able to push Russian forces back and open up a corridor to the city. However, the Russian military was able to regroup and launch a counterattack of their own, forcing Ukrainian forces to retreat and regroup.\n\n### Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn 20 May 2023, Russian forces launched a final assault on the city, which was defended by a small group of Ukrainian troops. The assault was successful, and Russian forces captured the city after a prolonged battle. However, the Russian military was unable to hold the city for long, and by early June 2023, they had withdrawn their forces from the area.\n\n**Military strength and tactics**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was characterized by a high degree of intensity and brutality. Both sides employed artillery, infantry, and air power to try and gain an advantage, but the Russian military maintained a significant advantage in terms of manpower and equipment. Ukrainian forces employed a combination of conventional and unconventional tactics, including the use of drones and sabotage, to try and counter Russian advances. However, the Russian military was able to adapt and respond to these tactics, and the battle continued for many months.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut had significant strategic and humanitarian implications. The city was severely damaged, and many residents were displaced or killed. The battle also highlighted the importance of the city's location, which is a key transportation hub and a strategic point in the Donetsk Oblast.

The city is also a key location for the production of steel and other industrial goods, making it an important economic center.\n\n### Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was fought in a variety of conditions, including urban, rural, and industrial settings. The city was severely damaged by artillery and rocket strikes, and many residents were forced to flee or hide in shelters. The rural areas surrounding the city were also heavily damaged, and many residents were displaced or killed. The industrial areas of the city were severely damaged, with many factories and infrastructure destroyed.\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut resulted in significant casualties on both sides. Ukrainian forces suffered heavy losses, including many killed and wounded soldiers, as well as civilian casualties. Russian forces also suffered significant losses, including many killed and wounded soldiers. The exact number of casualties is unknown, but estimates suggest that hundreds or even thousands of people were killed or wounded in the battle.\n\n### Military casualties\n\nUkrainian forces suffered significant military casualties in the battle for Bakhmut, including many killed and wounded soldiers.

The exact number of civilian casualties is unknown, but estimates suggest that hundreds or even thousands of people were killed or wounded in the battle.\n\n### Attrition\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was a prolonged and intense conflict that lasted for many months. Both sides suffered significant losses, including many killed and wounded soldiers, as well as civilian casualties. The battle also resulted in significant damage to infrastructure and property, making it a costly and devastating conflict.\n\n### Result\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut resulted in the capture of the city by Russian forces, but the Russian military was unable to hold the city for long. By early June 2023, Russian forces had withdrawn from the area, leaving behind a city that was severely damaged and a population that was displaced or killed.\n\n**Allegations of war crimes**\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut has been the subject of allegations of war crimes by both sides. Ukrainian forces have been accused of targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, while Russian forces have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war. The allegations of war crimes have not been independently verified, but they have been widely reported in the media and have sparked international condemnation.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* Battle of Soledar\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian military\n* Russian military\n\n**Notes**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on October 16, 1925, in Regent's Park, London, England, Lansbury began her career as a child actress and went on to become a beloved and iconic figure in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAngela Lansbury's career spans over seven decades, with a wide range of critically acclaimed performances in film, television, and theater. Her extensive body of work includes iconic roles in classic Hollywood films, groundbreaking television series, and numerous stage productions. This article provides an overview of Lansbury's life and career, highlighting her early beginnings, mid-career milestones, and global fame.\n\n**Early Life and Career Beginnings**\n\n### **Childhood: 1925–1942**\n\nAngela Lansbury was born to Edgar Lansbury and Moyna Macgill, a British actress. She was the granddaughter of Edgar Lansbury, a British politician and trade union leader. Lansbury's early life was marked by a love of music and dance, which was encouraged by her mother. She began taking ballet lessons at the age of six and began performing in school plays and local theater productions.\n\n### **Career Breakthrough: 1942–1945**\n\nLansbury's career began to take off in the early 1940s, when she was cast in a production of \"Gaslight\" at the Piccadilly Theatre in London.

It is one of the most famous landmarks in Paris and a prominent example of French architecture and art. The basilica is a prominent pilgrimage site and a beloved cultural icon.\n\n**History**\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a basilica on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking the city of Paris, dates back to the 19th century. In 1873, French architect Anatole de Baudot proposed a monumental church to commemorate the Franco-Prussian War. The project was initially met with skepticism, but it eventually gained momentum and support from the Catholic Church and the French government.\n\n### Site\n\nThe site chosen for the basilica was the highest point in Paris, offering breathtaking views of the city. The hill of Montmartre was already a popular spot for artists and visitors, and the location was seen as an ideal place for a monumental church. The site was previously occupied by a prison and a quarry, which were demolished to make way for the construction of the basilica.\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur began in 1875 and lasted for over 40 years, with several interruptions and changes in design. The project was initially intended to be a temporary structure, but it eventually became a permanent fixture in Paris. The basilica was designed in the Romano-Byzantine style, with a distinctive white dome and a striking façade.\n\n### Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur was not without controversy. Many Parisians saw the basilica as a symbol of the Catholic Church's power and influence in France, and some viewed it as a reminder of the country's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. The church was also criticized for its supposed \"foreign\" style, which was seen as an affront to traditional French architecture.\n\n**Description**\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe exterior of Sacré-Cœur is dominated by its white dome, which rises to a height of 83 meters (272 feet). The basilica's façade is adorned with a series of arched windows and a striking rose window above the main entrance. The exterior is made of travertine limestone, which gives the building a distinctive white color.\n\n### Interior\n\n#### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur is dominated by a large mosaic of the Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which covers the entire ceiling of the basilica. The mosaic was created by French artist Pierre Puget and took over 20 years to complete.\n\n#### Chapels\n\nThe basilica has several chapels, each dedicated to a different aspect of the Catholic faith.

The film stars Florence Pugh, Harry Styles, Chris Pine, Gemma Chan, KiKi Layne, Nick Kroll, and Sydney Chandler.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the 1950s and follows the story of Alice Chambers (Florence Pugh), a housewife living in the fictional community of Victory, California. Alice's life appears to be perfect, with a loving husband, Jack (Harry Styles), and a beautiful home. However, things take a turn when Alice begins to notice strange occurrences and inconsistencies in the seemingly idyllic community.\n\nAs Alice digs deeper, she discovers that the community is actually an experimental utopia created by the housing developer, Frank Franklin (Chris Pine). The community's residents are kept in a state of blissful ignorance, with their memories manipulated and their desires controlled. Alice's investigations put her at odds with the community's leaders, who will stop at nothing to keep the truth hidden.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Florence Pugh as Alice Chambers\n* Harry Styles as Jack Chambers\n* Chris Pine as Frank Franklin\n* Gemma Chan as Shelley\n* KiKi Layne as Margaret\n* Nick Kroll as Bill\n* Sydney Chandler as Bunny\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development and writing\n\nDon't Worry Darling was first announced in January 2019, with Olivia Wilde set to direct and Harry Styles set to star alongside Florence Pugh.

However, Wilde has denied these claims, saying that Styles was a \"dream\" to work with.\n\nThere were also reports of conflicts between Wilde and Pugh, with some sources claiming that the two had a difficult working relationship. However, Pugh has denied these claims, saying that she and Wilde had a \"wonderful\" relationship.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe trailer for Don't Worry Darling was released in September 2022, giving audiences a glimpse into the film's atmospheric and suspenseful world. The film's marketing campaign focused on the film's themes of deception and control, with posters and social media ads featuring the film's cast and taglines such as \"Something's not right\" and \"You don't know what's real\".\n\n**Release**\n\nDon't Worry Darling was released in theaters on September 23, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film was released on streaming platforms on October 28, 2022.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nDon't Worry Darling grossed over $90 million worldwide, with $36 million of that coming from the United States.

Slavery was a complex and multifaceted institution that played a crucial role in the Roman economy, social hierarchy, and culture.\n\n**Origins**\n\n### Enslavement of Roman Citizens\n\nRoman citizens could be enslaved through various means, including debt, war, and piracy. The Roman Republic was plagued by debt slavery, where individuals who owed money were sold into slavery to pay off their debts. War captives, often prisoners of war, were also frequently enslaved and sold into bondage. Piracy was another common means of enslavement, with pirates capturing and selling Roman citizens into slavery.\n\n**The Slave in Roman Law and Society**\n\n### Marriage and Family\n\nSlaves were allowed to marry and form families, but their marriage and family life was often subject to the whims of their owners. Slave marriage was not recognized by Roman law, and slaves who married were not entitled to the same rights and protections as free citizens. However, slave couples could have children, and their children were born into slavery.\n\n### Peculium\n\nPeculium was a system of personal property that slaves were allowed to accumulate and manage on their own. Slaves could use their peculium to purchase goods and services, and even to purchase their own freedom. However, peculium was not always respected by Roman owners, who often confiscated it as a form of punishment.\n\n### Manumission\n\nManumission was the process of freeing a slave. Slaves who were manumitted were granted their freedom and became freedmen or freedwomen. Manumission was often granted as a reward for loyal service or as a form of punishment for bad behavior.\n\n### Freedmen\n\nFreedmen were former slaves who had been granted their freedom. Freedmen often continued to work for their former owners, but they were entitled to the same rights and protections as free citizens. Freedmen could also establish their own households and businesses, and they were often integrated into Roman society.\n\n### Dediticii\n\nDediticii were individuals who had surrendered to their enemies in battle and were subsequently sold into slavery. Dediticii were often treated harshly by their Roman owners, who saw them as inferior and unworthy of freedom.\n\n**Causes of Enslavement**\n\n### War Captives\n\nWar captives were a common means of enslavement in ancient Rome. Prisoners of war were often sold into slavery to pay for the costs of war. The Roman Republic was particularly notorious for its treatment of war captives, who were often subjected to harsh conditions and brutal treatment.\n\n### Captivi in Roman Culture\n\nCaptivi was a Roman festival that celebrated the capture of enemies in battle. The festival featured staged battles and re-enactments of famous battles, and it was ofte", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are well-adapted to the harsh, cold climates of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, where they play a crucial role in the ecosystem as herbivores. Reindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, velvety coats, and unique physical characteristics that enable them to survive in one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth.\n\n**Description**\n\nReindeer are large, hoofed mammals that typically range in size from 100 to 130 cm (39 to 51 in) in height and 150 to 200 cm (59 to 79 in) in length, including their head. They weigh between 60 and 150 kg (132 to 331 lb), with males being generally larger than females. Their coat color varies from brown to gray to white, depending on the season and geographic location. In the summer, reindeer have a brown or reddish-brown coat, while in the winter, they turn white to blend in with the snow and ice.\n\n**Status**\n\nReindeer are found in the wild throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the world, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. There are an estimated 2.5 to 3 million reindeer in the wild, with populations fluctuating due to various environmental and anthropogenic factors. In some areas, reindeer herding is practiced by indigenous communities, which can impact local populations.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe term \"reindeer\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which means \"ren\" or \"reindeer.\" The name \"caribou\" is used in North America, particularly in Canada and Alaska, where the species is native. In scientific literature, the name \"Rangifer tarandus\" is often used to refer to the species.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nReindeer are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species around 1.5 million years ago. Fossil records indicate that reindeer-like species existed during the Pleistocene era, when the climate was colder and more harsh. Over time, reindeer adapted to their environment by developing unique physical characteristics, such as their antlers, which allow them to compete for mates and territory.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\n**Naming and research on museum collections**\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has been the subject of much research and debate. In the 19th century, scientists recognized two main subspecies of reindeer: the Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) and the Finnish reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). However, more recent studies have suggested that there are several distinct subspecies, including the Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) and the barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus).\n\n**Biological exploration expeditions**\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several biological exploration expeditions were conducted to study reindeer populations in the Arctic regions. These expeditions provided valuable insights into the behavior, ecology, and evolution of reindeer.\n\n**Reclassification**\n\n**Ecotypes**\n\nRecent studies have recognized several ecotypes of reindeer, which are adapted to specific environments and habitats. For example, the Svalbard reindeer is found in the Arctic tundra of Norway and is well-adapted to the harsh, cold climate. In contrast, the barren-ground caribou is found in the Arctic tundra of Canada and is adapted to the more open, treeless landscape.\n\n**Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence**\n\nMolecular studies have provided evidence of genetic diversity among reindeer populations, which is thought to be the result of adaptation to different environments and habitats.\n\n**Novel genetics-based clades**\n\nRecent studies have identified novel clades of reindeer based on genetic analysis, which have shed new light on the evolutionary history of the species.\n\n**Species and subspecies**\n\nThere are several species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus (European reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus tarandus (Finnish reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (Svalbard reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus pearyi (Peary caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus (barren-ground caribou)\n\n**Physical characteristics**\n\nReindeer have several unique physical characteristics that enable them to survive in the harsh, cold climates of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.\n\n**Antlers**\n\nReindeer are the only deer species in which both males and females grow antlers. Antlers are made of bone and are shed and regrown annually. They are used for defense, fighting, and attracting mates.\n\n**Pelt**\n\nReindeer have a thick, velvety coat that helps to insulate them from the cold. The coat color varies from brown to gray to white, depending on the season and geographic location.\n\n**Heat exchange**\n\nReindeer have a unique heat exchange system that allows them to conserve heat in cold temperatures. They do this by maximizing the efficiency of their blood flow and minimizing heat loss through their skin and fur.\n\n**Hooves**\n\nReindeer have large, hooved feet that are well-suited for walking on snow and ice. Their hooves are also highly specialized for digging and grasping.\n\n**Size**\n\nReindeer vary in size depending on the subspecies and sex. Males are generally larger than females.\n\n**Clicking sound**\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive clicking sound, which is made by the joints in their hooves as they walk.\n\n**Eyes**\n\nReindeer have large, dark eyes that are well-suited for seeing in low light conditions. Their eyes are also highly sensitive to motion, which helps them detect predators.\n\n**Biology and behaviors**\n\nReindeer are herbivores that feed on a variety of plants, including lichens, mosses, and grasses. They are well-adapted to their environment and have several unique behaviors that enable them to survive in the harsh, cold climates of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.\n\n**Seasonal body composition**\n\nReindeer undergo significant changes in their body composition throughout the year. In the summer, they have a higher body mass index and a more extensive fat layer, which helps them survive the winter months.\n\n**Reproduction and life cycle**\n\nReindeer breed in the fall and give birth to a single calf in the spring. The calf is weaned after several months and becomes independent after a year or two.\n\n**Social structure, migration and range**\n\nReindeer live in herds and are highly social animals. They migrate in search of food and suitable habitats and are highly adaptable to different environments and habitats.\n\n**Ecology**\n\nReindeer play a crucial role in the ecosystem of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. They are herbivores and help to maintain the balance of plant communities by grazing on lichens, mosses, and grasses.\n\n**Distribution and habitat**\n\nReindeer are found in the wild throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the world.\n\n**Diet**\n\nReindeer feed on a variety of plants, including lichens, mosses, and grasses.\n\n**Predators**\n\nReindeer have several predators, including wolves, bears, and humans.\n\n**Other threats**\n\nReindeer are threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and human activities such as hunting and poaching.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nReindeer are listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. However, some subspecies are listed as endangered due to habitat loss and other anthropogenic factors.\n\n**Current status**\n\nReindeer are found in the wild throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the world. There are an estimated 2.5 to 3 million reindeer in the wild, with populations fluctuating due to various environmental and anthropogenic factors.\n\n**Boreal woodland caribou**\n\nBoreal woodland caribou are a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the boreal forests of North America. They are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and other anthropogenic factors.\n\n**Peary caribou**\n\nPeary caribou are a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of Canada. They are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and other anthropogenic factors.\n\n**Relationship with humans**\n\nReindeer have a long history of interaction with humans. They have been hunted for their meat, antlers, and hides, and have also been domesticated for their milk and wool.\n\n**Indigenous North Americans**\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the traditional diet and culture of indigenous North Americans for thousands of years.\n\n**Indigenous Eurasians**\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the traditional diet and culture of indigenous Eurasians for thousands of years.\n\n**Husbandry**\n\nReindeer are domesticated in some parts of the world, including Scandinavia and Russia, where they are raised for their milk, wool, and meat.\n\n**History**\n\nReindeer have been an important part of human history for thousands of years. They have been hunted for their meat, antlers, and hides, and have also been domesticated for their milk and wool.\n\n**Santa Claus**\n\nReindeer are associated with the legend of Santa Claus, who is said to ride on the backs of reindeer on Christmas Eve.\n\n**Mythology and art**\n\nReindeer have been featured in various forms of art and mythology throughout history. They are often depicted as fierce and powerful animals, and are associated with the wilderness and the hunt.\n\n**Heraldry and symbols**\n\nReindeer have been used as a symbol in heraldry and are often depicted on coats of arms and other emblems.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reindeer\" following this outline:\n\n#Description\n#Status\n#Naming\n#Evolution\n#Taxonomy\n##Naming and research on museum collections\n##Biological exploration expeditions\n##Reclassification\n###Ecotypes\n###Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n###Novel genetics-based clades\n#Species and subspecies\n#Physical characteristics\n##Antlers\n##Pelt\n##Heat exchange\n##Hooves\n##Size\n##Clicking sound\n##Eyes\n#Biology and behaviors\n##Seasonal body composition\n##Reproduction and life cycle\n##Social structure, migration and range\n#Ecology\n##Distribution and habitat\n##Diet\n##Predators\n##Other threats\n#Conservation\n##Current status\n##Boreal woodland caribou\n##Peary caribou\n#Relationship with humans\n##Indigenous North Americans\n##Indigenous Eurasians\n##Husbandry\n##History\n##Santa Claus\n##Mythology and art\n##Heraldry and symbols\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n##Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
