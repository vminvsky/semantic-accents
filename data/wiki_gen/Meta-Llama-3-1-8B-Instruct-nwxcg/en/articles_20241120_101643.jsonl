approval rating based on 263 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Though there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, Spider-Man 3 nonetheless isn't quite as refined as the first two.\" [137] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [138] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale [139]\n\n\nRetrospective assessments\nRaimi himself would later call the film \"awful\" during a 2014 interview [161] [162] In 2018, Avi Arad accepted responsibility for pushing Raimi to include Venom in the film, and how the end result had disappointed many fans of the character, saying \"I think we learned that Venom is not a sideshow In all fairness, I'll take the guilt because of what Sam Raimi used to say in all of these interviews feeling guilty that I forced him into it\" [163] In 2021, Raimi acknowledged that the negative internet reaction to Spider-Man 3 at the time felt \"awful\" and had been difficult for him to take, but when his agent told him that he was being considered by Marvel Studios to direct Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), although initially hesitant about doing another superhero film, he ultimately decided to take the role [164]\n\n\nAccolades\nBoth the 35th Annie Awards and 61st British Academy Film Awards gave this movie one nomination, the former for Best Animated Effects and the latter for Best Special

3**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSpider-Man 3 is a 2007 superhero film directed by Sam Raimi and produced by Avi Arad and Grant Curtis. It is the third installment in the Spider-Man trilogy, following Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man 2 (2004). The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko. The movie follows Peter's struggles as he faces new villains and personal challenges, while also navigating his relationships and responsibilities as Spider-Man.\n\n**Plot**\n\nA year after Otto Octavius's sacrifice, Peter Parker plans to propose to Mary Jane Watson, who has made her Broadway musical debut. In Central Park, a meteorite lands near the two, from which an extraterrestrial symbiote oozes out and follows Peter to his apartment by attaching to his motorbike. Harry Osborn, knowing Peter is Spider-Man, seeks to avenge his father's death by using Norman's performance-enhancing gas and Green Goblin technology. Peter battles Harry to an eventual stalemate, developing partial amnesia following a fall from his glider. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and sick daughter before fleeing and falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, becoming Sandman.\n\n**Cast**\n\nSeveral actors reprise their roles from the previous films, including Dylan Baker as Dr. Curt Connors, a college physics professor under whom Peter Parker studies. Willem Dafoe portrays Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Harry's late father, who returns as a hallucination to encourage his son to destroy Spider-Man. Cliff Robertson appears as Ben Parker, Peter's deceased uncle in his final acting appearance before his retirement and death in 2011. Bill Nunn, Ted Raimi, Michael Papajohn, John Paxton, and Elizabeth Banks return as Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson, a longtime employee at the Daily Bugle; Ted Hoffman, also a longtime employee of the Daily Bugle; Dennis \"Spike\" Carradine, the carjacker who was believed to have murdered Uncle Ben; Bernard Houseman, butler to the Osborn family; and Betty Brant, the receptionist at the Daily Bugle for J Jonah Jameson, respectively. Elya Baskin additionally reprises his role as Mr. Ditkovitch, Peter's landlord, while Mageina Tovah reprises her role as Ursula, his daughter. Joe Manganiello reprises his role as Flash Thompson from the first film in a cameo appearance. Becky Ann Baker appears as Mrs. Stacy, and Perla Haney-Jardine appear as Emma and Penny Marko, Sandman's wife and daughter, respectively.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe most important thing Peter right now has to learn is that this whole concept of him as the avenger or him as the hero, he wears this red and blue outfit, with each criminal he brings to justice he's trying to pay down this debt of guilt he feels about the death of Uncle Ben. He considers himself a hero and a sinless person versus these villains that he nabs. We felt it would be a great thing for him to learn a little less black and white view of life and that he's not above these people.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe most important thing Peter right now has to learn is that this whole concept of him as the avenger or him as the hero, he wears this red and blue outfit, with each criminal he brings to justice he's trying to pay down this debt of guilt he feels about the death of Uncle Ben.

The same steps had been taken for Spider-Man 2 to begin producing visual effects early for sequences involving the villain Doctor Octopus.\n\n**Visual Effects**\n\nJohn Dykstra, who won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for his work on Spider-Man 2, declined to work on the third film as visual effects supervisor. Dykstra's colleague, Scott Stokdyk, took his place as supervisor, leading two hundred programmers at Sony Pictures Imageworks. This group designed specific computer programs that did not exist when Spider-Man 3 began production, creating nine hundred visual effects shots.\n\n**Deleted Scenes**\n\nWhen interviewed at the film's Tokyo premiere on April 16, 2007, Topher Grace said to Access Hollywood that despite liking how the film turned out, he expressed interest in having the rest of his scenes as both Eddie Brock and Venom being restored someday. Later, he added, \"You know what? Spider-Man 3.5, or however they release it. You know, with the extra scenes.\"\n\n**Music**\n\nDanny Elfman, the composer for the previous installments, chose not to return for the third installment of Spider-Man because of difficulties with director Sam Raimi.

screenings reached $20 million in 30 days, faster than any other 2D film remastered in the format [108]\n\n\nInitial critical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Spider-Man 3 holds a 63% approval rating based on 263 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10 The website's critics consensus reads, \"Though there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, Spider-Man 3 nonetheless isn't quite as refined as the first two.\" [137] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [138] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale [139]\n\n\nRetrospective assessments\nRaimi himself would later call the film \"awful\" during a 2014 interview [161] [162] In 2018, Avi Arad accepted responsibility for pushing Raimi to include Venom in the film, and how the end result had disappointed many fans of the character, saying \"I think we learned that Venom is not a sideshow In all fairness, I'll take the guilt because of what Sam Raimi used to say in all of these interviews feeling guilty that I forced him into it\" [163] In 2021, Raimi acknowledged that the negative internet reaction to Spider-Man 3 at the time felt \"awful\" and had been difficult for him to take, but when his agent told him that he was being considered by Marvel Studios to direct Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), although initially hesitant about doing another superhero film, he ultimately decided to take the role [164]\n\n\nAccolades\nBoth the 35th Annie Awards and 61st British Academy Film Awards gave this movie one nomination, the former for Best Animated Effects and the latter for Best Special Visual Effects Spider-Man 3 did not win any of the four Visual Effects Society Awards nominations it received Dunst's and Maguire's performances earned them each one nomination from the National Movie Awards She also received another nomination for Favorite Movie Actress from the 2008 Kids' Choice Awards ceremony The movie fared better at the Teen Choice Awards, amounting a total of seven nominations, varying from Choice Movie Villain (for Grace) to Choice Movie Dance (for Maguire) and Choice Movie Liplock (shared between Maguire and Dunst).\n\n\nFuture\n\nIn 2007, Spider-Man 4 entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned, and at one time, the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration Raimi said in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time and that if there were fifth and sixth films, they would be a continuation of each other [187] [188] [189] [190] Raimi said that he was unhappy with Spider-Man 3 and wanted Spider-Man 4 to be \"the best of all of them and end on a very high note\" [191] James Vanderbilt was hired in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in January 2007 that Sony Pictures was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first Spider-Man film [192] [193] The script was subsequently rewritten by Pulitzer-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire in November 2008 and rewritten again by Gary Ross in October 2009 [194] Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6 [193] A spin-off featuring Spider-Man 3's version of the Venom character was also planned; [195] this never materialized, though a Venom film featuring a different version of the character was eventually produced and released in 2018 [196] [197]\n\n\nCancelled sequels\n\nIn 2007, Spider-Man 4 entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst and other cast members set to reprise their roles Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned, and at one time, the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration

eventually produced and released in 2018 [196] [197]\n\n\nReboot and unproduced films\nA reboot of the series titled The Amazing Spider-Man was released on July 3, 2012, with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker [209] A sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014 [210]\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nFollowing the underwhelming critical and commercial reception of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Sony and Marvel Studios announced in February 2015 that a new iteration of Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in Captain America: Civil War [217] As part of the agreement, Sony Pictures continued to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films Marvel Studios and Sony will explore opportunities to integrate other characters of the MCU into future Spider-Man films [218] [219] [220] Sony released a standalone film titled Spider-Man: Homecoming, produced by Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal, on July 7, 2017 with Tom Holland starring as the new Spider-Man [221]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm made landfall in the Philippines on December 16, 2021, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nTyphoon Rai formed in the Pacific Ocean on December 9, 2021, when a low-latitude area of convection was identified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The area had a broad circulation and flaring convection, but was in a marginal environment with low to moderate wind shear, fair outflow, and warm sea surface temperatures. Despite this, the disturbance failed to intensify and dissipated the next day. A new area of low pressure formed on December 10, near the location of the previous disturbance, with a degraded and disorganized low-level circulation center. Position fixes on December 11 determined that the center had shifted to the north over a developing surface trough, with convective bursts occurring around the system.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nAs Typhoon Rai intensified into a tropical depression, a typhoon watch was issued by the US National Weather Service in Tiyan, Guam, in Koror and Kayangel, while a tropical storm warning was placed for Ngulu Atoll. The island of Yap was placed under tropical storm watch. These alerts were further upgraded into a typhoon warning for Palau as Rai further intensified. The alerts for Ngulu and Yap were canceled by 09:00 UTC on December 14, and six hours later, the typhoon warning were also canceled for Palau.\n\n**Federated States of Micronesia**\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia issued a typhoon watch and tropical storm warning for several islands, including Palau, Koror, and Kayangel. The warning was later canceled for Palau, but remained in effect for the other islands.\n\n**Philippines**\n\nSocial media coverage of the typhoon was much less than expected the day after Rai, partly due to the shutdown of regional news stations of media network ABS-CBN. Possible effects from the newly emerged COVID-19 Omicron variant were feared to be worsened by the typhoon's effects. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) further elaborated that over PHP 900 million worth of standby funds were already prepared for the people affected by Odette. Food and water was sparse for those impacted by the storm, and the storage of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine kits were feared to be disrupted due to power outages. While there were reports of vaccine wastage due to the typhoon, the Department of Health assured that the impact of the typhoon was minimal. Immediately after the storm, presidential aspirants for the 2022 elections set up relief and recovery operations for the victims of the storm, particularly in Samar and Leyte provinces.\n\n**Vietnam**\n\nRai wreaked havoc across Vietnamese-held isles in the Spratly Islands, with an observation tower in Southwest Cay recording sustained winds up to 180 km/h and a gust of 200 km/h during the afternoon of December 18 before being knocked down. The storm destroyed 500 square meters of civilian house tiles, 27 solar batteries, 400 square meters of farmland, and knocked down 90% of the trees on the island; no casualties were reported there. Rai began to batter the Central Vietnamese coast at night, with winds in several provinces averaging 65-90 km/h. Heavy rainfall was unleashed on Thừa Thiên – Huế to Khánh Hòa, with reports showing an average of 100-200 mm of rainfall; some places recorded up to 300 mm of rain.\n\n**Macau and Hong Kong**\n\nIn Macau, the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau (SMG) hoisted the typhoon warning signal number one on December 20, 2021. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the number 1 tropical cyclone signal at 11:20 AM on December 20, 2021, as Typhoon Rai approached the territory. Rai is the first typhoon on record to necessitate the issuance of typhoon warning signal in the territory in mid-December, and the second on record in December. The last time such a signal warning was issued in Hong Kong in December was in 1974 as a response to Typhoon Irma.\n\n**China**\n\nThe China Meteorological Administration issued blue typhoon warnings in Hainan and Guangdong Provinces.\n\n**Impact**\n\nTyphoon Rai caused severe and widespread damage throughout the Southern Philippines, killing at least 409 people. As of February 7, 2022, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has reported PHP 30.3 billion (USD 571 million) of infrastructure damages, along with PHP 22.3 billion (USD 435 million) of agricultural damage and PHP 63 million (USD 1.2 million) worth of damages to houses, with a combined total of PHP 51.8 billion (USD 1.02 billion).\n\n**International Response**\n\nAfter Typhoon Rai hit the Philippines, the governments of Canada, China, the United Kingdom, European Union, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and the United Nations had announced their intention to assist the country.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nDue to the extensive damage and high death toll in Visayas and Mindanao, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced that Odette will be stricken from the rotating list of typhoon names, and will never again be used for another typhoon name within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). On March 21, 2022, the PAGASA chose the name Opong as its replacement for the 2025 season.\n\n**Lack of Media Coverage Capacity**\n\nNews coverage regarding the impacts of Rai was limited in the days after the typhoon struck, partly due to the shutdown of regional news stations of media network ABS-CBN, which had earlier been denied a renewal of its congressional franchise. With internet service knocked out and mobile phone networks brought down in the wake of the typhoon, news from the typhoon-hit areas was very limited in the critical first days after the disaster.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of Typhoon Rai was marked by a lack of media coverage capacity, with limited news from the typhoon-hit areas. The international community responded with aid and assistance to the Philippines, while the Philippine government continued to provide relief and recovery operations to the victims of the storm.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Rai\" following this outline:\n\n\nMeteorological history\nAt 06:00 UTC on December 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started to monitor a low-latitude area of convection in the Pacific Ocean at 4°36′N 142°24′E﻿ / ﻿4.6°N 142.4°E﻿ / 4.6;

The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003 [88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble [89]\n\n\nSecond Florentino Pérez era (2009–present)\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline [90] [91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million, [92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million [93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos [94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks, [95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19 [96] [97]\n\n\nLa Décima and Champions League dominance\n\n\n\nFollowing Ronaldo's departure\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them [153] [154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million [155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari [156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles [157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club [158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively [159]\n\n\nFurther domestic success and La Decimocuarta\n\n\n\nEven more success and La Decimoquinta\nAfter a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate.\n\n\nCrests and colours\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.\nThe first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle [182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920 At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\" [183] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol [182]\n\n\nCrests\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing

[182]\n\n\nColours\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship [43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck [note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts [56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era [185]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nNote: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.\n\n\nKit deal\nNote: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.\n\n\nGrounds\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years [45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United [201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title [47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947 [56] [202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day [57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal [56]\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nRaúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741  appearances from 1994 to 2010 Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times [219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\n\n\nSupport\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000 [233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017 [234] [235]\n\n\nRivalries\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico) From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War [243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws [244]\n\n\nEl Clásico\nThere is often a fierce rivalry

football teams Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\" The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1 Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1 [47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\" [184] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid) [259] [260]\n\n\nEl Viejo Clásico\nA further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic), [270] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903 [271] [272] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico [273]\n\n\nEuropean rivalries\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times [279] [280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws), [281] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings [282] [283] [284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\n\n\nBayern Munich\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning

the most decorated Italian club They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25) [287] [288] [289]\n\n\nFinances and ownership\nIt was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club [299] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site [78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy [300]\n\n\nPopular culture\nReal Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream..

first league title since 2003 [88] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble [89]\n\n\nSecond Florentino Pérez era (2009–present)\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline [90] [91] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million, [92] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million [93] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos [94] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks, [95] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19 [96] [97]\n\n\nLa Décima and Champions League dominance\n\n\n\nFollowing Ronaldo's departure\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them [153] [154] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million [155] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari [156] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles [157] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club [158] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively [159]\n\n\nFurther domestic success and La Decimocuarta\n\n\n\nEven more success and La Decimoquinta\nAfter a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate.\n\n\nCrests and colours\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.\nThe first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle [182] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920 At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\" [183] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol [182]\n\n\nCrests\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol [182]\n\n\nColours\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship [43] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck [note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts [56] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era [185]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nNote: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.\n\n\nKit deal\nNote: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.\n\n\nGrounds\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years [45] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United [201] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title [47] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947 [56] [202] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day [57] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal [56]\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nRaúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741  appearances from 1994 to 2010 Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times [219] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\n\n\nSupport\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000 [233] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017 [234] [235]\n\n\nRivalries\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico) From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War [243] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws [244]\n\n\nEl

being shared between fans of both football teams Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\" The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1 Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1 [47] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\" [184] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid) [259] [260]\n\n\nEl Viejo Clásico\nA further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic), [270] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903 [271] [272] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico [273]\n\n\nEuropean rivalries\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times [279] [280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws), [281] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings [282] [283] [284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\n\n\nBayern Munich\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times [279] [280] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup

[283] [284] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\n\n\nJuventus\nAnother match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25) [287] [288] [289]\n\n\nFinances and ownership\nIt was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club [299] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site [78] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy [300]\n\n\nPopular culture\nReal Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream.. (2007) The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing [322]\n\n\nReal Madrid TV\nReal Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club The channel is available in Spanish and English It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre.\n\n\nHala Madrid\nHala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders [324] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans) [325] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches [324]\n\n\nVideo games\nReal Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times.\n\n\nHonours\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.\n\n\nPlayers\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.\n\n\nCurrent squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nReserve and Academy team's\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nCurrent technical staff\n\n\nManagement\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "2023_Ohio_train_derailment", "content": "\nBackground\nThe derailed train was Norfolk Southern train 32N, [10] operating from the Terminal Railroad Association of St Louis yard in Madison, Illinois, to Norfolk Southern's Conway Yard in Conway, Pennsylvania, on the Fort Wayne Line Aboard the 9,300-foot-long (1.76 mi; 2.8 km) train [11] were an engineer, conductor, and conductor trainee [12] The train consisted of 3 diesel locomotives, which were NS AC44C6M 4178, NS AC44C6M 4224, (both of which were placed at the front of 32N), and NS AC44C6M 4412, which was placed in the middle of the train (used as a distributed power unit, also known as a DPU), 141 loaded cars and 9 empty cars [13] Other reports note one more car, for a total of 151 cars, weighing 18,000 tons [14] \nOf those cars, 20 were carrying hazardous materials, including chloroethene (vinyl chloride), butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, isobutylene, combustible liquids, and benzene residue [15] [16] [17] The train departed Madison on February 1, and had suffered at least one mechanical failure before the derailment [18]\n\n\nDerailment\nSecurity footage from a business in Salem, Ohio (20 miles  [32 km] northwest of East Palestine), and a Ring doorbell camera from New Waterford, Ohio (4 miles  [6 km] northwest from East Palestine), show fire emanating from underneath a rail car as it went by on the tracks [19] [20] After this, at around 8:55 pm EST on February 3, 2023, 51 cars derailed on the east side of East Palestine, near the border with Pennsylvania 49 of the cars ended up in a derailment pile, which caught fire and burned for several days [21] [22] Of the 51 derailed cars, 11 were tank cars that dumped 100,000 US gallons (380,000 L) of hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, benzene residue, and butyl acrylate [23] [24] [25]\n\n\nEmergency response and burn off\nNearly 70 emergency agencies from Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania mobilized in response [29] East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway declared a state of emergency [30]\n\n\nBurnoff unnecessary\nIn February 2024, Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), testified before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (SCCST) that the controlled release and burn of vinyl chloride was not necessary Homendy stated that the decision-makers relied on contractors who were alarmed by the limited temperature readings they were able to get, combined with the violent way one of the tank cars released vinyl chloride with a roar from a pressure release valve after hours of calm [53] However, Homendy also stated that OxyVinyls, the company that manufactured and was shipping the volatile chemicals, did not believe polymerization was occurring [54] During the NTSB field hearing in June of 2023, OxyVinyl's on-scene expert testified he had said he at one point believed polymerization could be occurring Dewine was not made aware that officials from Oxyvinyls were at the scene of the derailment [55] Norfolk Southern and their clean-up contractors testified that their rationale for the burn was the belief that polymerization of the vinyl chloride was imminent; [56] this required quickly increasing ambient temperature and an oxygen infusion – neither of which occurred Officials from Oxyvinyl, also involved in litigation from the incident, [57] testified that the temperature in the derailed tank cars was descending, no deadly chemical reaction was occurring, so the controlled burn was unnecessary The cars could have been left to cool down The smoke and residue of the burning chemicals have concerned local citizens about long-term health ramifications [58] [59] Both Ohio senators reacted to Homendy's announcement J.D Vance wondered why the unnecessary burnoff was rushed and suggested Norfolk Southern wanted to open the rail line and move freight again Sherrod Brown said the burnoff provided proof that Norfolk Southern considered profit more than safety [60] Data collected by the U.S EPA, Norfolk Southern, and independent scientists have indicated the air is safe [61] The NTSB will announce its final findings on the cause of the accident at a board meeting on June 25, 2024, at East Palestine High School This will be the second time the full board of the NTSB will visit East Palestine The first was in the summer of 2023 [62]\n\n\nHealth and environmental concerns\nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources stated the chemical spill killed an estimated 3,500 small fish across 7.5 mi (12 km) of streams as of February 8 [63] A later estimate put the number of minnows at 38,222, with other species of animals at 5,500, totaling 43,222 [64] Several captive foxes at Parker Dairy became sick over the following weekend, and one died, which its owner attributed to the derailment [65] Material from the crash was observed in storm drains and detected in samples from Sulphur Run, Leslie Run, Bull Creek, North Fork Little Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and the Ohio River An oily product was seen seeping into the soil Emergency response staff are assessing potential impacts on aquatic life [41] [33] On February 23, Mary Mertz, director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, stated that the derailment potentially killed more than 43,000 fish, crustaceans, amphibians and other marine animals State officials said on February 23 that they have not seen deaths or other negative effects on animals living on the land [66] However, residents report that pets and animals as far as 10 miles (16 km) from the derailment site died overnight during the controlled release of vinyl chloride [67] In late March, CBS News reported that inhabitants have continued to experience health symptoms, despite officials asserting that no harmful chemicals were detected in the air or water Employees of the CDC who investigated the derailment in early March also experienced symptoms [68]\n\n\nWaste disposal\nOfficials in Michigan expressed disappointment that contaminated soil had been disposed of in southeast Michigan without their knowledge, while officials in Texas likewise acknowledged that they were only officially informed of waste water disposal from the derailment in Texas via an announcement on DeWine's website [79]\n\n\nIndependent testing\nResearchers from multiple universities entered the impact area to conduct environmental sampling in February 2023 Results of the Texas A&M [81] and a Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) investigation indicated chemical levels in the air above long-term exposure limits [82] In particular, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, benzene, m-,p-,o-xylenes, naphthalene, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride were detected An associate professor from CMU, Albert Presto, said that acrolein was a cause for continuing research because of potential risk The presence of acrolein was found in some parts of East Palestine at levels as found in other American cities such as Pittsburgh Acrolein was not listed in the chemicals that Norfolk Southern indicated were transported in the railcars; however, it can be produced by the combustion of fuel, wood and plastics [83] [84]\n\n\nWhistleblower and cover-up allegations\nAn EPA whistleblower alleged that the EPA covered up evidence of toxic chemicals by intentionally delaying the deployment of chemical-sensing aircraft and turning off chemical sensors According to the whistleblower, the EPA hid its misconduct from FOIA requests by falsifying records and instructing staff to omit keywords in order to evade in an FOIA search [87] [88] [89]\n\n\nAftermath\nImmediately following the derailment, Norfolk Southern implemented a new six-point safety plan based on recommendations from an independent safety consultant [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nLawsuits and compensation\nOn February 8, affected businesses and residents filed three class action lawsuits against Norfolk Southern Railway [120] [121] One demands the company to pay for the medical screenings and treatments of people living within a 30 mi (48 km) radius of the derailment [122] Norfolk Southern Railway offered $1,000 payments to locals to \"cover costs related to the evacuation\" Some residents expressed concerns that taking these payouts would limit their ability to join future legal actions [123]\n\n\nNTSB board meeting and findings\nIn June 2024, at a meeting of the NTSB board in East Palestine, the board was presented with findings on the derailment and its subsequent consequences The members voted unanimously to accept the findings and announced a final report would be issued in the near future The board did proclaim that Norfolk Southern's decision to release and burn toxic chemicals was “misguided” and that NS had “…misinterpreted and disregarded…” evidence in deciding to perform the release and burn operation [144]\nThe Chair of the NTSB board, Jennifer Homendy accused Norfolk Southern of threatening the NTSB board, attempting to manufacture evidence and withholding documents from the investigation She called the company's activity \"unconscionable\" and \"reprehensible\" She then recounted a series of “inappropriate” and “unethical” actions including hiring a private lab to test the vinyl chloride, presenting “a threat” to the board and inviting the five-member board to confer personally with the railway on the day prior to the formal NTSB board meeting Norfolk Southern said its decisions and actions were made in the safety interests of first responders and the community [145]\n\n\nFederal Railroad Administration safety culture assessment\nIn August 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a report known as a safety culture assessment about operations at Norfolk Southern Parts of the assessment make references to the East Palestine derailment This incident raised concerns among federal officials about Norfolk Southern’s handling of hazardous materials and prompted a regulatory response from the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) and the FRA.\n\n\nInquiry and cause\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Norfolk Southern was accused of prioritizing $10 billion stock buybacks [147] for shareholders instead of maintenance [148] Shaw was accused of sidestepping questions about Norfolk Southern's support for President Trump's 2017 overturning of the Obama administration requirement for ECP brakes and Norfolk Southern's pressing the federal government against a rule that, in most cases, would require more than one person operating a freight train [149] [150]\n\n\nHearings\nOn June 22, the NTSB began a two-day public \"field hearing\" in East Palestine, which included testimony from emergency responders and scientists, and from representatives from Norfolk Southern and their contractors, rail unions, and chemical manufacturers [151] It was the agency's first on-site investigative hearing since a 2017 aircraft crash in Alaska that killed three [152] The prior evening, residents were given a chance to ask NTSB and other government officials about the investigative process in a community meeting, with many residents expressing support for improvements in rail safety One resident asked why the railroad had not yet conducted a full inspection of the site;

The incident resulted in a massive fire and the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, affecting the local community and wildlife.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe derailed train was Norfolk Southern train 32N, operating from the Terminal Railroad Association of St Louis yard in Madison, Illinois, to Norfolk Southern's Conway Yard in Conway, Pennsylvania, on the Fort Wayne Line. Aboard the 9,300-foot-long train were an engineer, conductor, and conductor trainee. The train consisted of 3 diesel locomotives and 151 cars, weighing 18,000 tons. Of those cars, 20 were carrying hazardous materials, including chloroethene (vinyl chloride), butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, isobutylene, combustible liquids, and benzene residue. The train departed Madison on February 1, and had suffered at least one mechanical failure before the derailment.\n\n**Derailment**\n\nSecurity footage from a business in Salem, Ohio, and a Ring doorbell camera from New Waterford, Ohio, show fire emanating from underneath a rail car as it went by on the tracks. At around 8:55 pm EST on February 3, 2023, 51 cars derailed on the east side of East Palestine, near the border with Pennsylvania. 49 of the cars ended up in a derailment pile, which caught fire and burned for several days. Of the 51 derailed cars, 11 were tank cars that dumped 100,000 US gallons of hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, benzene residue, and butyl acrylate.\n\n**Emergency Response and Burn Off**\n\nNearly 70 emergency agencies from Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania mobilized in response to the derailment. East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway declared a state of emergency. A controlled release and burn of vinyl chloride was conducted, which was later deemed unnecessary by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, testified that the decision-makers relied on contractors who were alarmed by the limited temperature readings they were able to get, combined with the violent way one of the tank cars released vinyl chloride with a roar from a pressure release valve after hours of calm.\n\n**Health and Environmental Concerns**\n\nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources stated that the chemical spill killed an estimated 3,500 small fish across 7.5 miles of streams as of February 8. Later estimates put the number of minnows at 38,222, with other species of animals at 5,500, totaling 43,222. Several captive foxes at Parker Dairy became sick over the following weekend, and one died, which its owner attributed to the derailment. Material from the crash was observed in storm drains and detected in samples from Sulphur Run, Leslie Run, Bull Creek, North Fork Little Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and the Ohio River.\n\n**Waste Disposal**\n\nOfficials in Michigan expressed disappointment that contaminated soil had been disposed of in southeast Michigan without their knowledge. Officials in Texas likewise acknowledged that they were only officially informed of waste water disposal from the derailment in Texas via an announcement on Governor DeWine's website.\n\n**Independent Testing**\n\nResearchers from multiple universities entered the impact area to conduct environmental sampling in February 2023. Results of the Texas A&M and Carnegie Mellon University investigation indicated chemical levels in the air above long-term exposure limits. 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, benzene, m-,p-,o-xylenes, naphthalene, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride were detected.\n\n**Whistleblower and Cover-up Allegations**\n\nAn EPA whistleblower alleged that the EPA covered up evidence of toxic chemicals by intentionally delaying the deployment of chemical-sensing aircraft and turning off chemical sensors. According to the whistleblower, the EPA hid its misconduct from FOIA requests by falsifying records and instructing staff to omit keywords in order to evade in an FOIA search.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nImmediately following the derailment, Norfolk Southern implemented a new six-point safety plan based on recommendations from an independent safety consultant.\n\n**Lawsuits and Compensation**\n\nOn February 8, affected businesses and residents filed three class action lawsuits against Norfolk Southern Railway. Norfolk Southern Railway offered $1,000 payments to locals to \"cover costs related to the evacuation.\" Some residents expressed concerns that taking these payouts would limit their ability to join future legal actions.\n\n**NTSB Board Meeting and Findings**\n\nIn June 2024, at a meeting of the NTSB board in East Palestine, the board was presented with findings on the derailment and its subsequent consequences. The members voted unanimously to accept the findings and announced a final report would be issued in the near future.\n\n**Federal Railroad Administration Safety Culture Assessment**\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a report known as a safety culture assessment about operations at Norfolk Southern. This incident raised concerns among federal officials about Norfolk Southern’s handling of hazardous materials and prompted a regulatory response from the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) and the FRA.\n\n**Congress**\n\nThe Biden administration, in particular U.S Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, faced criticism after the derailment. Some lawmakers and locals of East Palestine described the response as delayed and lackluster. Right-wing and Republican lawmakers criticized Buttigieg, and some on the political left, such as David Sirota, also criticized Buttigieg.\n\n**Misinformation**\n\nThe derailment sparked the spread and circulation of misinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories. Most were exaggerations of the derailment and the events surrounding it.\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nSeveral news reports have drawn parallels between this derailment and the 2012 Paulsboro train derailment, which also involved the release of vinyl chloride.\n\n**Subsequent Derailments**\n\nOn March 4, 2023, another Norfolk Southern train derailed near Springfield, Ohio. The train was not transporting any hazardous chemicals, according to Norfolk Southern.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Ohio_train_derailment\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe derailed train was Norfolk Southern train 32N, [10] operating from the Terminal Railroad Association of St Louis yard in Madison, Illinois, to Norfolk Southern's Conway Yard in Conway, Pennsylvania, on the Fort Wayne Line Aboard the 9,300-foot-long (1.76 mi; 2.8 km) train [11] were an engineer, conductor, and conductor trainee [12] The train consisted of 3 diesel locomotives, which were NS AC44C6M 4178, NS AC44C6M 4224, (both of which were placed at the front of 32N), and NS AC44C6M 4412, which was placed in the middle of the train (used as a distributed power unit, also known as a DPU), 141 loaded cars and 9 empty cars [13] Other reports note one more car, for a total of 151 cars, weighing 18,000 tons [14] \nOf those cars, 20 were carrying hazardous materials, including chloroethene (vinyl chloride), butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, isobutylene, combustible liquids, and benzene residue [15] [16] [17] The train departed Madison on February 1, and had suffered at least one mechanical failure before the derailment [18]\n\n\nDerailment\nSecurity footage from a business in Salem, Ohio (20 miles  [32 km] northwest of East Palestine), and a Ring doorbell camera from New Waterford, Ohio (4 miles  [6 km] northwest from East Palestine), show fire emanating from underneath a rail car as it went by on the tracks [19] [20] After this, at around 8:55 pm EST on February 3, 2023, 51 cars derailed on the east side of East Palestine, near the border with Pennsylvania 49 of the cars ended up in a derailment pile, which caught fire and burned for several days [21] [22] Of the 51 derailed cars, 11 were tank cars that dumped 100,000 US gallons (380,000 L) of hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, benzene residue, and butyl acrylate [23] [24] [25]\n\n\nEmergency response and burn off\nNearly 70 emergency agencies from Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania mobilized in response [29] East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway declared a state of emergency [30]\n\n\nBurnoff unnecessary\nIn February 2024, Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), testified before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (SCCST) that the controlled release and burn of vinyl chloride was not necessary Homendy stated that the decision-makers relied on contractors who were alarmed by the limited temperature readings they were able to get, combined with the violent way one of the tank cars released vinyl chloride with a roar from a pressure release valve after hours of calm [53] However, Homendy also stated that OxyVinyls, the company that manufactured and was shipping the volatile chemicals, did not believe polymerization was occurring [54] During the NTSB field hearing in June of 2023, OxyVinyl's on-scene expert testified he had said he at one point believed polymerization could be occurring Dewine was not made aware that officials from Oxyvinyls were at the scene of the derailment [55] Norfolk Southern and their clean-up contractors testified that their rationale for the burn was the belief that polymerization of the vinyl chloride was imminent; [56] this required quickly increasing ambient temperature and an oxygen infusion – neither of which occurred Officials from Oxyvinyl, also involved in litigation from the incident, [57] testified that the temperature in the derailed tank cars was descending, no deadly chemical reaction was occurring, so the controlled burn was unnecessary The cars could have been left to cool down The smoke and residue of the burning chemicals have concerned local citizens about long-term health ramifications [58] [59] Both Ohio senators reacted to Homendy's announcement J.D Vance wondered why the unnecessary burnoff was rushed and suggested Norfolk Southern wanted to open the rail line and move freight again Sherrod Brown said the burnoff provided proof that Norfolk Southern considered profit more than safety [60] Data collected by the U.S EPA, Norfolk Southern, and independent scientists have indicated the air is safe [61] The NTSB will announce its final findings on the cause of the accident at a board meeting on June 25, 2024, at East Palestine High School This will be the second time the full board of the NTSB will visit East Palestine The first was in the summer of 2023 [62]\n\n\nHealth and environmental concerns\nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources stated the chemical spill killed an estimated 3,500 small fish across 7.5 mi (12 km) of streams as of February 8 [63] A later estimate put the number of minnows at 38,222, with other species of animals at 5,500, totaling 43,222 [64] Several captive foxes at Parker Dairy became sick over the following weekend, and one died, which its owner attributed to the derailment [65] Material from the crash was observed in storm drains and detected in samples from Sulphur Run, Leslie Run, Bull Creek, North Fork Little Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and the Ohio River An oily product was seen seeping into the soil Emergency response staff are assessing potential impacts on aquatic life [41] [33] On February 23, Mary Mertz, director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, stated that the derailment potentially killed more than 43,000 fish, crustaceans, amphibians and other marine animals State officials said on February 23 that they have not seen deaths or other negative effects on animals living on the land [66] However, residents report that pets and animals as far as 10 miles (16 km) from the derailment site died overnight during the controlled release of vinyl chloride [67] In late March, CBS News reported that inhabitants have continued to experience health symptoms, despite officials asserting that no harmful chemicals were detected in the air or water Employees of the CDC who investigated the derailment in early March also experienced symptoms [68]\n\n\nWaste disposal\nOfficials in Michigan expressed disappointment that contaminated soil had been disposed of in southeast Michigan without their knowledge, while officials in Texas likewise acknowledged that they were only officially informed of waste water disposal from the derailment in Texas via an announcement on DeWine's website [79]\n\n\nIndependent testing\nResearchers from multiple universities entered the impact area to conduct environmental sampling in February 2023 Results of the Texas A&M [81] and a Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) investigation indicated chemical levels in the air above long-term exposure limits [82] In particular, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, benzene, m-,p-,o-xylenes, naphthalene, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride were detected An associate professor from CMU, Albert Presto, said that acrolein was a cause for continuing research because of potential risk The presence of acrolein was found in some parts of East Palestine at levels as found in other American cities such as Pittsburgh Acrolein was not listed in the chemicals that Norfolk Southern indicated were transported in the railcars; however, it can be produced by the combustion of fuel, wood and plastics [83] [84]\n\n\nWhistleblower and cover-up allegations\nAn EPA whistleblower alleged that the EPA covered up evidence of toxic chemicals by intentionally delaying the deployment of chemical-sensing aircraft and turning off chemical sensors According to the whistleblower, the EPA hid its misconduct from FOIA requests by falsifying records and instructing staff to omit keywords in order to evade in an FOIA search [87] [88] [89]\n\n\nAftermath\nImmediately following the derailment, Norfolk Southern implemented a new six-point safety plan based on recommendations from an independent safety consultant [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nLawsuits and compensation\nOn February 8, affected businesses and residents filed three class action lawsuits against Norfolk Southern Railway [120] [121] One demands the company to pay for the medical screenings and treatments of people living within a 30 mi (48 km) radius of the derailment [122] Norfolk Southern Railway offered $1,000 payments to locals to \"cover costs related to the evacuation\" Some residents expressed concerns that taking these payouts would limit their ability to join future legal actions [123]\n\n\nNTSB board meeting and findings\nIn June 2024, at a meeting of the NTSB board in East Palestine, the board was presented with findings on the derailment and its subsequent consequences The members voted unanimously to accept the findings and announced a final report would be issued in the near future The board did proclaim that Norfolk Southern's decision to release and burn toxic chemicals was “misguided” and that NS had “…misinterpreted and disregarded…” evidence in deciding to perform the release and burn operation [144]\nThe Chair of the NTSB board, Jennifer Homendy accused Norfolk Southern of threatening the NTSB board, attempting to manufacture evidence and withholding documents from the investigation She called the company's activity \"unconscionable\" and \"reprehensible\" She then recounted a series of “inappropriate” and “unethical” actions including hiring a private lab to test the vinyl chloride, presenting “a threat” to the board and inviting the five-member board to confer personally with the railway on the day prior to the formal NTSB board meeting Norfolk Southern said its decisions and actions were made in the safety interests of first responders and the community [145]\n\n\nFederal Railroad Administration safety culture assessment\nIn August 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued a report known as a safety culture assessment about operations at Norfolk Southern Parts of the assessment make references to the East Palestine derailment This incident raised concerns among federal officials about Norfolk Southern’s handling of hazardous materials and prompted a regulatory response from the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) and the FRA.\n\n\nInquiry and cause\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Norfolk Southern was accused of prioritizing $10 billion stock buybacks [147] for shareholders instead of maintenance [148] Shaw was accused of sidestepping questions about Norfolk Southern's support for President Trump's 2017 overturning of the Obama administration requirement for ECP brakes and Norfolk Southern's pressing the federal government against a rule that, in most cases, would require more than one person operating a freight train [149] [150]\n\n\nHearings\nOn June 22, the NTSB began a two-day public \"field hearing\" in East Palestine, which included testimony from emergency responders and scientists, and from representatives from Norfolk Southern and their contractors, rail unions, and chemical manufacturers [151] It was the agency's first on-site investigative hearing since a 2017 aircraft crash in Alaska that killed three [152] The prior evening, residents were given a chance to ask NTSB and other government officials about the investigative process in a community meeting, with many residents expressing support for improvements in rail safety One resident asked why the railroad had not yet conducted a full inspection of the site; an EPA representative said it was \"a back and forth process\" Resident Misti Allison said she particularly appreciated the on-site hearing given how infrequently it is done [151]\n\n\nBrakes\nElectronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes may potentially reduce stopping distances by up to 60 percent over conventional railway air brakes [3] The derailed train was not equipped with ECP brakes, which former Federal Railroad Administration official Steven Ditmeyer said would have mitigated the severity of the accident The Obama administration proposed safety regulations for trains carrying hazardous materials in 2014;

Just before midnight on the night of June 1, the Diomed reported winds of hurricane force and a pressure of 984 millibars (29.1 inHg). The ship Peshawar reported a westerly hurricane at the east end of the Gulf of Aden towards midnight on the night of June 2. At noon on June 3, the Tantallon reported a pressure of 943 millibars (27.8 inHg) near 12.5N 45.5E. On June 3, the German corvette Augusta, the French dispatch boat Renard, and the British ship SS Speke Hall were lost in the storm in the Gulf of Aden. The system continued westward and shrank in scale as it moved into the entrance of the Red Sea, crossing the coast of Djibouti. It became the first North Indian Ocean tropical cyclone in recorded history to transit the gulf of Aden with fully hurricane intensity and held the record of westernmost landfalling North Indian Ocean tropical cyclone ever and also the only recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in the nation of Djibouti.\n\n### June 1885 Aden cyclone\n\nA cyclone had formed near the Laccadive Islands on May 24, 555 kilometres (345 mi) west of southern India.

As Skeeter begins to interview the maids, she becomes embroiled in a battle over racial segregation and discovers the harsh realities of the world around her.\n\n**Cast**\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark\n* Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Elizabeth Leefolt\n* Jessica Chastain as Hilly Holbrook\n* Emma Stone as Skeeter Phelan\n* Allison Janney as Charlotte Phelan\n* Sissy Spacek as Missus Walters\n* Chris Lowell as Stuart Whitworth\n* Ahna O'Reilly as Hilly's friend, Elise Speckler\n* Mary Steenburgen as Celia Foote\n\n**Production**\nThe film was produced by Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Mark Radcliffe under their production company 1492 Pictures, in association with Harbinger Productions. The film was written and directed by Tate Taylor, who optioned the film rights to the book before its publication. The novel's film rights were obtained by DreamWorks in March 2010. Reliance Entertainment and Participant Media co-produced the film.\n\n**Development**\nThe film was in development for several years before production began in July 2010. The city of Greenwood was chosen to portray 1960s-era Jackson, and producer Brunson Green said he had expected to shoot \"95 percent\" of the film there. Parts of the film were also shot in the real-life Jackson, as well as in the cities of Clarksdale and Greenville. One of the few real locations in the book and the film is Brent's Drugs, which dates to 1946. Other locations that can still be found in Jackson include the New Capitol Building and the Mayflower Cafe downtown.\n\n**Filming**\nFilming began in July 2010 and extended through October. The film was shot on location in various cities in Mississippi, including Jackson, Greenwood, Clarksdale, and Greenville. The film's cinematographer, Andrea Arnold, used a combination of handheld camera shots and static shots to capture the intimacy and realism of the characters' experiences.\n\n**Music**\nTwo soundtracks were released for The Help: an original soundtrack and an original score. Geffen Records released the soundtrack album on August 4, 2011. It remained authentic to the 60s period. The 12-track collection, collated by music supervisor Jennifer Hawks, features songs from the likes of Johnny Cash, Frankie Valli, and Ray Charles. As a collective, the songs spotlight the peak of the fight for equality in the United States during the civil rights movement. Mary J. Blige's \"The Living Proof\" is the only original track. She composed it after a second viewing of the film. In an interview with Fandom Entertainment in 2011, Blige said she was \"moved in so many ways\" by the film. Her raw emotions inspired her to compose the lone song for the film.\n\n**Release**\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed The Help worldwide through the studio's Touchstone Pictures banner. On October 13, 2010, Disney gave the film a release date of August 12, 2011. On June 30, 2011, the film's release date was rescheduled two days earlier to August 10, 2011.\n\n**Theatrical run**\nThe film was released in the United States on August 10, 2011, and was a commercial success, grossing over $169 million in the United States and over $52 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of over $221 million.\n\n**Home media**\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (under the Touchstone Home Entertainment label) on Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and digital download on December 6, 2011.

It was also released as a digital download option in both standard and high definition.\n\n**Reception**\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 76% of 232 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Though arguably guilty of glossing over its racial themes, The Help rises on the strength of its cast – particularly Viola Davis, whose performance is powerful enough to carry the film on its own.\"\n\n**Accolades**\nThe film was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, the Academy Award for Best Actress for Viola Davis, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer. Octavia Spencer won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film.\n\n**Historical accuracy**\nThe film focuses on maids during the Civil Rights Movement in 1963 and brings light to Medgar Evers, an African-American activist and NAACP leader, who worked toward gaining rights for African-Americans at the time, as well as aiding in the fight to end segregation. In the film, Skeeter and the two maids are seen watching Evers' address, and the moment where the news of Evers' assassination is transmitted drives Skeeter to interview the maids for their stories.\n\n**Legacy**\nViola Davis has repeatedly expressed regret over starring in The Help, claiming she feels like she \"betrayed myself and my people\" and that the film was \"created in the filter and the cesspool of systemic racism.\" Bryce Dallas Howard has also mentioned that she would not agree to star in the film today, acknowledging that it was \"told through the perspective of a white character and was created by predominantly white storytellers.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Help_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn

power for the powertrain throughout the race weekend [79]\n\n\nCalendar\nTwenty-two Grands Prix were originally scheduled for the 2020 World Championship [2] However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous race cancellations and postponements A rescheduled calendar consisted of seventeen Grands Prix, nine from the original 2020 calendar and eight other Grands Prix, while the other thirteen original 2020 races were cancelled This also meant that the season started with two races in Austria, and later on in the season there were also two races at Silverstone Circuit along with two races at Bahrain International Circuit Each race is the minimum number of laps that exceeds a total distance of 305 km (189.5 mi) Under the sporting regulations, a minimum of eight races must take place for the season to be considered a championship [48] [f]\n\n\nCancelled Grands Prix\nThe following rounds were included on the original calendar published by the World Motor Sport Council but were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n\nChanges from the 2019 calendar to the original 2020 calendar\nAfter purchasing the commercial rights to the sport from CVC Capital Partners in January 2017, Liberty Media announced plans to expand the Formula One calendar using a concept they termed \"destination races\" and modelled on the Singapore Grand Prix [61] Under the \"destination races\" model, Grands Prix would be established in or near key tourist destinations and integrate racing, entertainment and social functions Several countries and venues announced plans to bid for a Grand Prix, [62] [63] with two bids being successful:\n\n\nRegulation changes\nTeams were allowed to use an additional MGU-K compared to 2019 to compensate for the increased demands of contesting the originally planned twenty-two races [73] [74] [clarification needed]\n\n\nSporting regulations\nTeams were allowed to use an additional MGU-K compared to 2019 to compensate for the increased demands of contesting the originally planned twenty-two races [73] [74] [clarification needed]\n\n\nTechnical regulations\nIn order to reduce the risk of punctures, the last 50 mm (2.0 in) of the front wing could no longer contain any metal Brake ducts could no longer be outsourced and must be made and designed by the team The amount of fuel that could be outside of the fuel tank was reduced from 2 litres (3.5 imp pt) to 250 millilitres (0.44 imp pt) A decrease in electronic driver aids meant that drivers were responsible for managing more of the car's torque during race starts

place, McLaren announced their withdrawal from the event after a team member tested positive for the virus [85] This led to the Grand Prix being cancelled altogether the following morning [86] Later that day, it was announced that the Bahrain Grand Prix would be postponed rather than closed to spectators, as would the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix [56]\n\n\nRescheduled calendar\nIn March, teams agreed that the 2020 Championship could run into early 2021 to ensure the running of as many races as possible Such a move would also ensure that eight Grands Prix could be held, over three different continents, thereby meeting the minimum number of races needed for the season to qualify as a World Championship [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nRegulatory changes\nThe pandemic required changes to the format of a race weekend, which included abandoning the drivers' parade and pre-race assembly for the host venue's national anthem A modified podium ceremony was planned for after races [117] The FIA introduced limits to the number of team personnel who could be on the starting grid to prepare cars and changed the cut-off times for cars to leave pit lane to minimise the amount of time team personnel spent on the grid [118] Tyre supplier Pirelli was also required to provide an identical allocation of tyre compounds to all teams and drivers Where Pirelli were previously required to announce compounds for a race several weeks in advance, this window was reduced to two weeks, allowing them to respond to anticipated changes to the calendar [118]\n\n\nSolidarity campaign\nIn June, Formula One launched the We Race As One initiative to fight racism, global inequity and the impact of COVID-19 The initiative used a rainbow logo, with the colours of all ten Formula One teams, also

Grand Prix, Renault launched a protest against the brake ducts of Racing Point's car, the RP20, alleging that Racing Point had copied the brake ducts from the Mercedes F1 W10, the car used in 2019 by Mercedes Similar protests would be launched after the Hungarian and British Grands Prix with the verdict being published between the British and 70th Anniversary Grands Prix The ruling concluded that

\"2020_Formula_One_World_Championship\" following this outline:\n\n\nEntries\nThe following teams and drivers competed in the 2020 World Championship [5] All teams competed with tyres supplied by Pirelli [6]\n\n\nFree practice drivers\nAcross the season, four drivers drove as a test or third driver in free practice sessions Jack Aitken and Roy Nissany both drove for Williams at one and three Grands Prix, respectively, Robert Kubica drove for Alfa Romeo Racing at five Grands Prix and Mick Schumacher drove for Haas at one Grand Prix [29]\n\n\nTeam changes\nRed Bull GmbH, the parent company of Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso, renamed Toro Rosso as \"Scuderia AlphaTauri\" The team uses the constructor name \"AlphaTauri\" [23] The name is derived from Red Bull's AlphaTauri fashion brand [31]\n\n\nDriver changes\nAfter a year's absence, Esteban Ocon returned to racing in Formula One after signing a contract with Renault, replacing Nico Hülkenberg [32] Robert Kubica left Williams at the end of the 2019 championship and joined Alfa Romeo Racing as a reserve driver [7] Nicholas Latifi, the 2019 Formula 2 Championship runner-up, replaced Kubica at Williams [33] [34]\n\n\nMid-season changes\nFrom the Italian Grand Prix, drivers were only allowed to run one engine mode from the start of qualifying to the end of the race [78] However, drivers were still allowed to use electrical power for the powertrain throughout the race weekend [79]\n\n\nCalendar\nTwenty-two Grands Prix were originally scheduled for the 2020 World Championship [2] However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous race cancellations and postponements A rescheduled calendar consisted of seventeen Grands Prix, nine from the original 2020 calendar and eight other Grands Prix, while the other thirteen original 2020 races were cancelled This also meant that the season started with two races in Austria, and later on in the season there were also two races at Silverstone Circuit along with two races at Bahrain International Circuit Each race is the minimum number of laps that exceeds a total distance of 305 km (189.5 mi) Under the sporting regulations, a minimum of eight races must take place for the season to be considered a championship [48] [f]\n\n\nCancelled Grands Prix\nThe following rounds were included on the original calendar published by the World Motor Sport Council but were cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n\nChanges from the 2019 calendar to the original 2020 calendar\nAfter purchasing the commercial rights to the sport from CVC Capital Partners in January 2017, Liberty Media announced plans to expand the Formula One calendar using a concept they termed \"destination races\" and modelled on the Singapore Grand Prix [61] Under the \"destination races\" model, Grands Prix would be established in or near key tourist destinations and integrate racing, entertainment and social functions Several countries and venues announced plans to bid for a Grand Prix, [62] [63] with two bids being successful:\n\n\nRegulation changes\nTeams were allowed to use an additional MGU-K compared to 2019 to compensate for the increased demands of contesting the originally planned twenty-two races [73] [74] [clarification needed]\n\n\nSporting regulations\nTeams were allowed to use an additional MGU-K compared to 2019 to compensate for the increased demands of contesting the originally planned twenty-two races [73] [74] [clarification needed]\n\n\nTechnical regulations\nIn order to reduce the risk of punctures, the last 50 mm (2.0 in) of the front wing could no longer contain any metal Brake ducts could no longer be outsourced and must be made and designed by the team The amount of fuel that could be outside of the fuel tank was reduced from 2 litres (3.5 imp pt) to 250 millilitres (0.44 imp pt) A decrease in electronic driver aids meant that drivers were responsible for managing more of the car's torque during race starts [74]\n\n\nMid-season changes\nFrom the Italian Grand Prix, drivers were only allowed to run one engine mode from the start of qualifying to the end of the race [78] However, drivers were still allowed to use electrical power for the powertrain throughout the race weekend [79]\n\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe season was heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an announcement prior to the start of the championship that the Chinese Grand Prix would be postponed due to the early COVID-19 outbreak in the country [57]\n\n\nInitial response\nThe season was heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an announcement prior to the start of the championship that the Chinese Grand Prix would be postponed due to the early COVID-19 outbreak in the country [57]\n\n\nRace postponements and cancellations\nThe season-opening Australian Grand Prix was expected to go ahead and all teams and drivers arrived at the venue as planned Three days before the race was due to take place, McLaren announced their withdrawal from the event after a team member tested positive for the virus [85] This led to the Grand Prix being cancelled altogether the following morning [86] Later that day, it was announced that the Bahrain Grand Prix would be postponed rather than closed to spectators, as would the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix [56]\n\n\nRescheduled calendar\nIn March, teams agreed that the 2020 Championship could run into early 2021 to ensure the running of as many races as possible Such a move would also ensure that eight Grands Prix could be held, over three different continents, thereby meeting the minimum number of races needed for the season to qualify as a World Championship [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nRegulatory changes\nThe pandemic required changes to the format of a race weekend, which included abandoning the drivers' parade and pre-race assembly for the host venue's national anthem A modified podium ceremony was planned for after races [117] The FIA introduced limits to the number of team personnel who could be on the starting grid to prepare cars and changed the cut-off times for cars to leave pit lane to minimise the amount of time team personnel spent on the grid [118] Tyre supplier Pirelli was also required to provide an identical allocation of tyre compounds to all teams and drivers Where Pirelli were previously required to announce compounds for a race several weeks in advance, this window was reduced to two weeks, allowing them to respond to anticipated changes to the calendar [118]\n\n\nSolidarity campaign\nIn June, Formula One launched the We Race As One initiative to fight racism, global inequity and the impact of COVID-19 The initiative used a rainbow logo, with the colours of all ten Formula One teams, also with the #WeRaceAsOne hashtag, and featured prominent We Race As One branding on vehicles (including the safety car) and signage on track Formula One and several teams launched projects or fundraising efforts in support of the initiative [119] [120]\n\n\nProtests against car legality\nAhead of the season opening Austrian Grand Prix, Red Bull launched a protest against the Mercedes F1 W11's dual axis steering, a system where the driver can adjust the toe of the car by pulling and pushing on the steering wheel The system was found to be legal for 2020, but it would be banned by the FIA from 2021 onward [121]\n\n\nMercedes\nAhead of the season opening Austrian Grand Prix, Red Bull launched a protest against the Mercedes F1 W11's dual axis steering, a system where the driver can adjust the toe of the car by pulling and pushing on the steering wheel The system was found to be legal for 2020, but it would be banned by the FIA from 2021 onward [121]\n\n\nRacing Point\nAfter the Styrian Grand Prix, Renault launched a protest against the brake ducts of Racing Point's car, the RP20, alleging that Racing Point had copied the brake ducts from the Mercedes F1 W10, the car used in 2019 by Mercedes Similar protests would be launched after the Hungarian and British Grands Prix with the verdict being published between the British and 70th Anniversary Grands Prix The ruling concluded that Racing Point had illegally copied the brake ducts of the Mercedes F1 W10 and Racing Point were subsequently penalised by 15 Constructors' Championship points and fined €400,000 [122]\n\n\nSeason summary\nThe delayed season started with five races at three venues.\n\n\nSpielberg, Mogyoród, Silverstone, and Montmeló\nThe delayed season started with five races at three venues.\n\n\nSpa, Monza, Mugello, Sochi, Núrburgring, Portimão\nThe next six races were single rounds at each venue, including two new circuits and a returning circuit  The Belgian Grand Prix was won by Lewis Hamilton, who led every lap and won by 8 seconds over teammate Valtteri Bottas who finished second ahead of Max Verstappen Daniel Ricciardo finished fourth, setting the fastest lap on the last lap On lap 11, Antonio Giovinazzi crashed at Campus corner; one of the wheels of his car came loose and hit the front right suspension of George Russell’s car, causing both drivers to retire from the race This brought out the safety car for three laps Renault achieved a finish of P4 and P5, equalling their best result since their return to the sport in 2016 [135]\n\n\nImola, Istanbul, Salyut, and Yas\nFormula One returned to the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari for the 27th time, the first since 2006 with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, where Lewis Hamilton won from Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Ricciardo who picked up his second podium of the season Max Verstappen had a puncture from second, putting him out of the race Mercedes won their seventh consecutive Constructor World Championship [141]\n\n\nResults and standings\nPoints were awarded to the top ten classified drivers and the driver who set the fastest lap The driver with the fastest lap had to be within the top 10 to receive

{"title": "Taiwan", "content": "\nEtymology\nIn his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island, or the part of it closest to Penghu [55] Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa specifically; the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon [56]\n\n\nNames for the island\nIn his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island, or the part of it closest to Penghu [55] Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa specifically; the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon [56]\n\n\nNames of the country and jurisdiction\nThe official name of the country in English is the \"Republic of China\" Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" (Zhōngguó, 中國) to refer to itself, derived from zhōng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and guó (\"state, nation-state\") [o] The term developed under the Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne, [p] and was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and later to China's Central Plain, before being used as an occasional synonym for the state during the Qing era [71] The name of the republic had stemmed from the party manifesto of the Tongmenghui in 1905, which says the four goals of the Chinese revolution was \"to expel the Manchu rulers, to revive Chunghwa, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people.\" [III] Revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen proposed the name Chunghwa Minkuo as the assumed name of the new country when the revolution succeeded.\n\n\nHistory\nTaiwan was joined to the Asian mainland in the Late Pleistocene, until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago [82] Human remains and Paleolithic artifacts dated 20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found [83] [84] Study of the human remains suggested they were Australo-Papuan people similar to Negrito populations in the Philippines [85] Paleolithic Taiwanese likely settled the Ryukyu Islands 30,000 years ago [86] Slash-and-burn agriculture practices started at least 11,000 years ago [87]\n\n\nPre-colonial period\nTaiwan was joined to the Asian mainland in the Late Pleistocene, until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago [82] Human remains and Paleolithic artifacts dated 20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found [83] [84] Study of the human remains suggested they were Australo-Papuan people similar to Negrito populations in the Philippines [85] Paleolithic Taiwanese likely settled the Ryukyu Islands 30,000 years ago [86] Slash-and-burn agriculture practices started at least 11,000 years ago [87]\n\n\nEarly colonial period (to 1683)\nThe Penghu Islands were inhabited by Han Chinese fishermen by 1171, and in 1225 Penghu was attached to Jinjiang [99] [100] [101] [102] The Yuan dynasty officially incorporated Penghu under the jurisdiction of Tong'an County in 1281 [102] Penghu was evacuated in the 15th century by the Ming dynasty as part of their maritime ban, which lasted until the late 16th century [103] In 1349, Wang Dayuan provided the first written account of a visit to Taiwan [104] [105] By the 1590s, a small number of Chinese from Fujian had started cultivating land in southwestern Taiwan [106] Some 1,500-2,000 Chinese lived or stayed temporarily on the southern coast of Taiwan, mostly for seasonal fishing but also subsistence farming and trading, by the early 17th century [107] [105] In 1603, Chen Di visited Taiwan on an anti-wokou expedition and recorded an account of the Taiwanese Indigenous people [62]\n\n\nQing rule (1683–1895)\nFollowing the defeat of Koxinga's grandson by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang in 1683, the Qing dynasty formally annexed Taiwan in May 1684, making it a prefecture of Fujian province while retaining its administrative seat (now Tainan) under Koxinga as the capital [129] [130] [131]\n\n\nJapanese rule (1895–1945)\nFollowing the Qing defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), Taiwan, its associated islands, and the Penghu archipelago were ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki [157] Inhabitants wishing to remain Qing subjects had to move to mainland China within a two-year grace period, which few saw as feasible [158] Estimates say around 4,000 to 6,000 departed before the expiration of the grace period, and 200,000 to 300,000 followed during the subsequent disorder [159] [135] [160] On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule Japanese forces entered the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895 [161] About 6,000 inhabitants died in the initial fighting and some 14,000 died in the first year of Japanese rule Another 12,000 \"bandit-rebels\" were killed from 1898 to 1902 [162] [163] [164] Subsequent rebellions against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915, and the Musha incident of 1930) were unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition to Japanese rule.\n\n\nRepublic of China (1945–present)\nWhile Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the Republic of China was founded on mainland China on 1 January 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 [180] Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915–28), Japanese invasion (1937–45), and the Chinese Civil War (1927–49), with central authority strongest during the Nanjing decade (1927–37), when most of China came under the control of the Kuomintang (KMT) [181] During World War II, the 1943 Cairo Declaration specified that Formosa and the Pescadores be returned by Japan to the ROC; [182] [183] the terms were later repeated in the 1945 Potsdam Declaration [184] that Japan agreed to carry out in its instrument of surrender [185] [186] On 25 October 1945, Japan surrendered Taiwan to the ROC, and in the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan formally renounced their claims to the islands, though without specifying to whom they were surrendered [187] [188] [189] [190] [q] In the same year, Japan and the ROC signed a peace treaty [191]\n\n\nMartial law era (1949–1987)\nMartial law, declared on Taiwan in May 1949, [210] continued to be in effect until 1987, [210] [211] and was used to suppress political opposition During the White Terror, as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist [212] Many citizens were arrested, tortured, imprisoned or executed for their real or perceived link to the Chinese Communist Party Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an entire generation of political and social leaders was destroyed.\n\n\nTransition to democracy\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988, Lee Teng-hui became the first president of the ROC born in Taiwan [241] Lee's administration oversaw a period of democratization in which the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion were abolished and the Additional Articles of the Constitution were introduced [242] [243] Congressional representation was allocated to only the Taiwan Area, [244] and Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint [245] while assimilationist policies were replaced with support for multiculturalism [246] In 1996, Lee was re-elected in the first direct presidential election [247] During Lee's administration, both he and his party were involved in corruption controversies that came to be known as \"black gold\" politics [248] [249] [250]\n\n\nGeography\nThe land controlled by the ROC consists of 168 islands [n] with a combined area of 36,193 square kilometres (13,974 sq mi) [17] [39] [i] The main island, known historically as Formosa, makes up 99 percent of this area, measuring 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi) and lying some 180 kilometres (112 mi) across the Taiwan Strait from the southeastern coast of mainland China The East China Sea lies to its north, the Philippine Sea to its east, the Luzon Strait directly to its south and the South China Sea to its southwest Smaller islands include the Penghu Islands in the Taiwan Strait, the Kinmen, Matsu and Wuqiu islands near the Chinese coast, and some of the South China Sea islands.\n\n\nClimate\nTaiwan lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical [14] The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate [274] The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June [275] The entire island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September Typhoons are most common in July, August and September [275] During the winter (November to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny.\n\n\nGeology\nThe island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine Mobile Belt on the east and south The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant [278]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe government of the Republic of China was founded on the 1947 Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people\" [281] It underwent significant revisions in the 1990s, known collectively as the Additional Articles The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).\n\n\nGovernment\nThe government of the Republic of China was founded on the 1947 Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people\" [281] It underwent significant revisions in the 1990s, known collectively as the Additional Articles The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).\n\n\nConstitution\nThe constitution was drafted by the KMT while the ROC still governed the Chinese mainland [287] Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s resulted in the end of martial law in 1987, and Taiwan transformed into a multiparty democracy in the early 1990s The constitutional basis for this transition to democracy was gradually laid in the Additional Articles of the Constitution These articles suspended portions of the Constitution designed for the governance of mainland China and replacing them with articles adapted for the governance of and guaranteeing the political rights of residents of the Taiwan Area, as defined in the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area [288]\n\n\nMajor camps\nTaiwan's political scene is divided into two major camps in terms of cross-Strait relations, i.e how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC The Pan-Green Coalition (e.g the Democratic Progressive Party) leans pro-independence, and the Pan-Blue Coalition (e.g the Kuomintang) leans pro-unification [296] Moderates in both camps regard the Republic of China as a sovereign independent state, but the Pan-Green Coalition regard the ROC as synonymous with Taiwan, [297] while moderates in the Pan-Blue Coalition view it as synonymous with China [298] These positions formed against the backdrop of the PRC's Anti-Secession Law, which threatens the use of \"non-peaceful means\" to respond to formal Taiwanese independence [299] The ROC government has understood this to mean a military invasion of Taiwan [300]\n\n\nNational identity\nRoughly 84 percent of Taiwan's population are descendants of Han Chinese immigrants between 1683 and 1895 Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s The shared cultural origin as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones.\n\n\nPublic opinion\nDomestic public opinion has preferred maintaining the status quo, though pro-independence sentiment has steadily risen since 1994 In June 2021, an annual poll found that 28.2 percent supported the status quo and postponing a decision, 27.5 percent supported maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 25.8 percent supported the status quo with a move toward independence, 5.9 percent supported the status quo with a move toward unification, 5.7 percent gave no response, 5.6 percent supported independence as soon as possible, and 1.5 percent supported unification as soon as possible [317] A referendum question in 2018 asked if Taiwan's athletes should compete under \"Taiwan\" in the 2020 Summer Olympics but did not pass; the New York Times attributed the failure to a campaign cautioning that a name change might lead to Taiwan being banned \"under Chinese pressure\" [318]\n\n\nForeign relations and international status\nThe political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that the PRC replaced the ROC government in 1949, becoming the sole legal government of China [81] The ROC, however, has its own currency, widely accepted passport, postage stamps, internet TLD, armed forces and constitution with an independently elected president [329] It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed this historical claim [330]\n\n\nRelations with the PRC\nThe Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of Taiwan is responsible for relations with the PRC, while the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) of the PRC is responsible for relations with Taiwan Exchanges are conducted through private organizations both founded in 1991: the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the PRC.\n\n\nParticipation in international events and organizations\nThe ROC was a founding member of United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced with the PRC as the ROC now has neither official membership nor observer status in the organization Since 1993, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it past committee stage [364] [365] Due to the One China policy, most UN member states, including the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC's political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC [366]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Republic of China Armed Forces takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army, which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang When the People's Liberation Army won the Chinese Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government The 1947 Constitution of the ROC reformed it into the Republic of China Armed Forces, making it the national army rather than the army of a political party Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\n\nLGBT rights\nOn 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-current marriage laws had been violating the Constitution by denying same-sex couples the right to marry The Court ruled that if the Legislative Yuan did not pass adequate amendments to Taiwanese marriage laws within two years, same-sex marriages would automatically become lawful in Taiwan [416] In a referendum question in 2018, however, voters expressed overwhelming opposition to same-sex marriage and supported the removal of content about homosexuality from primary school textbooks According to the New York Times, the referendum questions were subject to a \"well-funded and highly organized campaign led by conservative Christians and other groups\" involving the use of misinformation [318] Nevertheless, the vote against same-sex marriage does not affect the court ruling, and on 17 May 2019, Taiwan's parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, making it the first country in Asia to do so [417] [418] [419]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAccording to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing national boundaries\" [422] The ROC is, de jure constitutionally, divided into provinces  [zh], special municipalities (which are further divided into districts for local administration), and the province-level Tibet Area Each province is subdivided into cities and counties, which are further divided into townships and county-administered cities, each having elected mayors and city councilors who share duties with the county Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighborhoods The provinces have been \"streamlined\" and are no longer functional [423] Similarly, Mongol banners for China's Inner Mongolia also existed, [292] but they were abolished in 2006 and the ROC reaffirmed its recognition of Mongolia (formerly known as Outer Mongolia in Taiwan) in 2002, as stipulated in the 1946 constitution [424] [425] [426]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\" Taiwan is one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore As of October 2022, Taiwan is the 21st largest economy in the world by nominal GDP [428]\n\n\nTransport\nThe Ministry of Transportation and Communications of Taiwan is the cabinet-level governing body of the transport network in Taiwan Civilian transport in Taiwan is characterized by extensive use of scooters In March 2019, 13.86 million were registered, twice that of cars [449] Both highways and railways are

"Taiwan\n================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nTaiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), is an island country located in East Asia. It is bordered by the East China Sea to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the southwest. Taiwan has a population of approximately 23.4 million people and is known for its rich cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and vibrant economy.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe name \"Taiwan\" is derived from the Han Chinese word \"Tay-wan,\" which means \"great southern slope.\" In his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island, or the part of it closest to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa specifically; the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan, or even Luzon.\n\nNames for the island\n--------------------\n\nIn his Daoyi Zhilüe (1349), Wang Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island, or the part of it closest to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in general or Okinawa specifically; the name Ryūkyū is the Japanese form of Liúqiú. The name also appears in the Book of Sui (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan, or even Luzon.\n\nNames of the country and jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe official name of the country in English is the \"Republic of China.\" Shortly after the ROC's establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland, the government used the short form \"China\" (Zhōngguó, 中國) to refer to itself, derived from zhōng (\"central\" or \"middle\") and guó (\"state, nation-state\"). The name of the republic had stemmed from the party manifesto of the Tongmenghui in 1905, which says the four goals of the Chinese revolution was \"to expel the Manchu rulers, to revive Chunghwa, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people.\"\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nTaiwan was joined to the Asian mainland in the Late Pleistocene, until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Human remains and Paleolithic artifacts dated 20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found. Study of the human remains suggested they were Australo-Papuan people similar to Negrito populations in the Philippines. Paleolithic Taiwanese likely settled the Ryukyu Islands 30,000 years ago. Slash-and-burn agriculture practices started at least 11,000 years ago.\n\nPre-colonial period\n-------------------\n\nTaiwan was joined to the Asian mainland in the Late Pleistocene, until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Human remains and Paleolithic artifacts dated 20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found. Study of the human remains suggested they were Australo-Papuan people similar to Negrito populations in the Philippines. Paleolithic Taiwanese likely settled the Ryukyu Islands 30,000 years ago. Slash-and-burn agriculture practices started at least 11,000 years ago.\n\nEarly colonial period (to 1683)\n------------------------------\n\nThe Penghu Islands were inhabited by Han Chinese fishermen by 1171, and in 1225 Penghu was attached to Jinjiang. The Yuan dynasty officially incorporated Penghu under the jurisdiction of Tong'an County in 1281. Penghu was evacuated in the 15th century by the Ming dynasty as part of their maritime ban, which lasted until the late 16th century. In 1349, Wang Dayuan provided the first written account of a visit to Taiwan. By the 1590s, a small number of Chinese from Fujian had started cultivating land in southwestern Taiwan. Some 1,500-2,000 Chinese lived or stayed temporarily on the southern coast of Taiwan, mostly for seasonal fishing but also subsistence farming and trading, by the early 17th century.\n\nQing rule (1683–1895)\n---------------------\n\nFollowing the defeat of Koxinga's grandson by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang in 1683, the Qing dynasty formally annexed Taiwan in May 1684, making it a prefecture of Fujian province while retaining its administrative seat (now Tainan) under Koxinga as the capital.\n\nJapanese rule (1895–1945)\n-----------------------\n\nFollowing the Qing defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), Taiwan, its associated islands, and the Penghu archipelago were ceded to Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants wishing to remain Qing subjects had to move to mainland China within a two-year grace period, which few saw as feasible. Estimates say around 4,000 to 6,000 departed before the expiration of the grace period, and 200,000 to 300,000 followed during the subsequent disorder.\n\nMartial law era (1949–1987)\n-----------------------------\n\nMartial law, declared on Taiwan in May 1949, continued to be in effect until 1987, and was used to suppress political opposition. During the White Terror, as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist.\n\nTransition to democracy\n----------------------\n\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988, Lee Teng-hui became the first president of the ROC born in Taiwan. Lee's administration oversaw a period of democratization in which the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion were abolished and the Additional Articles of the Constitution were introduced. Congressional representation was allocated to only the Taiwan Area, and Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint, while assimilationist policies were replaced with support for multiculturalism.\n\nGovernment and politics\n----------------------\n\nThe government of the Republic of China was founded on the 1947 Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" It underwent significant revisions in the 1990s, known collectively as the Additional Articles. The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).\n\nConstitution\n------------\n\nThe constitution was drafted by the KMT while the ROC still governed the Chinese mainland. Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s resulted in the end of martial law in 1987, and Taiwan transformed into a multiparty democracy in the early 1990s. The constitutional basis for this transition to democracy was gradually laid in the Additional Articles of the Constitution.\n\nMajor camps\n------------\n\nTaiwan's political scene is divided into two major camps in terms of cross-Strait relations, i.e how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC. The Pan-Green Coalition (e.g the Democratic Progressive Party) leans pro-independence, and the Pan-Blue Coalition (e.g the Kuomintang) leans pro-unification. Moderates in both camps regard the Republic of China as a sovereign independent state, but the Pan-Green Coalition regard the ROC as synonymous with Taiwan, while moderates in the Pan-Blue Coalition view it as synonymous with China.\n\nNational identity\n----------------\n\nRoughly 84 percent of Taiwan's population are descendants of Han Chinese immigrants between 1683 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones.\n\nPublic opinion\n--------------\n\nDomestic public opinion has preferred maintaining the status quo, though pro-independence sentiment has steadily risen since 1994. In June 2021, an annual poll found that 28.2 percent supported the status quo and postponing a decision, 27.5 percent supported maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 25.8 percent supported the status quo with a move toward independence, 5.9 percent supported the status quo with a move toward unification, 5.7 percent gave no response, 5.6 percent supported independence as soon as possible, and 1.5 percent supported unification as soon as possible.\n\nForeign relations and international status\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The PRC claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that the PRC replaced the ROC government in 1949, becoming the sole legal government of China. The ROC, however, has its own currency, widely accepted passport, postage stamps, internet TLD, armed forces and constitution with an independently elected president. It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed this historical claim.\n\nRelations with the PRC\n----------------------\n\nThe Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of Taiwan is responsible for relations with the PRC, while the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) of the PRC is responsible for relations with Taiwan. Exchanges are conducted through private organizations both founded in 1991: the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the PRC.\n\nParticipation in international events and organizations\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ROC was a founding member of United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced with the PRC as the ROC now has neither official membership nor observer status in the organization. Since 1993, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it past committee stage.\n\nMilitary\n--------\n\nThe Republic of China Armed Forces takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army, which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the People's Liberation Army won the Chinese Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. The 1947 Constitution of the ROC reformed it into the Republic of China Armed Forces, making it the national army rather than the army of a political party.\n\nLGBT rights\n------------\n\nOn 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-current marriage laws had been violating the Constitution by denying same-sex couples the right to marry. The Court ruled that if the Legislative Yuan did not pass adequate amendments to Taiwanese marriage laws within two years, same-sex marriages would automatically become lawful in Taiwan. In a referendum question in 2018, however, voters expressed overwhelming opposition to same-sex marriage and supported the removal of content about homosexuality from primary school textbooks. Nevertheless, the vote against same-sex marriage does not affect the court ruling, and on 17 May 2019, Taiwan's parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, making it the first country in Asia to do so.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n-------------------------\n\nThe ROC is, de jure constitutionally, divided into provinces, special municipalities (which are further divided into districts for local administration), and the province-level Tibet Area. Each province is subdivided into cities and counties, which are further divided into townships and county-administered cities, each having elected mayors and city councilors who share duties with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\nThe quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle.\" Taiwan is one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. As of October 2022, Taiwan is the 21st largest economy in the world by nominal GDP.\n\nTransport\n----------\n\nThe Ministry of Transportation and Communications of Taiwan is the cabinet-level governing body of the transport network in Taiwan. Civilian transport in Taiwan is characterized by extensive use of scooters. In March 2019, 13.86 million were registered, twice that of cars. Both highways and railways are concentrated near the coasts, where the majority of the population resides, with 1,619 km (1,006 mi) of motorway. Railways in Taiwan are primarily used for passenger services, with Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) operating a circular route around the island and Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) running high-speed services on the west coast. Urban transit systems include Taipei Metro, Kaohsiung Metro, Taoyuan Metro, New Taipei Metro, and Taichung Metro.\n\nDemographics\n-------------\n\nTaiwan has a population of about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island of Taiwan. The remainder live on the outlying islands of Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).\n\nLargest cities and counties\n-----------------------------\n\nThe figures below are the March 2019 estimates for the twenty most populous administrative divisions; a different ranking exists when considering the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung metro area is by far the largest agglomeration). The figures reflect the number of household registrations in each city, which may differ from the number of actual residents.\n\nEthnic groups\n--------------\n\nThe ROC government reports that 95 percent of the population is ethnically Han Chinese. There are also 2.4 percent indigenous Austronesian peoples and 2.6 percent new immigrants primarily from China and Southeast Asia.\n\nLanguages\n----------\n\nThe Republic of China does not have any legally designated official language. Mandarin is the primary language used in business and education, and is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Traditional Chinese is used as the writing system.\n\nReligion\n----------\n\nEstimated religious composition in 2020:\n\n* 35.4% Buddhist\n* 33.0% Christian\n* 14.0% Taoist\n* 12.4% folk religion\n* 5.2% other religions\n\nEducation\n----------\n\nTaiwan is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve one's socioeconomic position in society.

Local and international Taiwanese cuisine, including its history, is a politically contentious topic. Famous Taiwanese dishes include Taiwanese beef noodle soup, Gua bao, Zongzi, Khong bah png, Taiwanese fried chicken, oyster vermicelli, Sanbeiji, and Aiyu jelly. Bubble tea, created in Taiwan in the 1980s, has now become popular globally. In 2014, The Guardian called Taiwanese night markets the \"best street food markets in the world\". The Michelin Guide began reviewing restaurants in Taiwan in 2018.\n\nSports\n------\n\nBaseball is commonly considered Taiwan's national sport and is a popular spectator sport. The men's team won medals across all levels of baseball in 2022, including the U-12, U-15, U-18, U-23, and Baseball5 competitions, the only team to do so in baseball history. The results made Taiwan's national baseball team one of the top-ranked teams in the WBSC World Rankings. Professional baseball in Taiwan started with the founding of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in 1989. As of 2024, the CPBL has six teams, with an average attendance of over 7,000 per game.\n\nCalendar\n----------\n\nThe standard Gregorian calendar is used for most purposes. The year is often denoted by the Minguo era system which starts in 1912, the year the ROC was founded. 2024 is year 113 Minguo (民國113年). The East Asian date format is used in Chinese. Prior to standardization in 1929, the Chinese calendar was officially used.

the Tapani incident of 1915, and the Musha incident of 1930) were unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition to Japanese rule.\n\n\nRepublic of China (1945–present)\nWhile Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the Republic of China was founded on mainland China on 1 January 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 [180] Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915–28), Japanese invasion (1937–45), and the Chinese Civil War (1927–49), with central authority strongest during the Nanjing decade (1927–37), when most of China came under the control of the Kuomintang (KMT) [181] During World War II, the 1943 Cairo Declaration specified that Formosa and the Pescadores be returned by Japan to the ROC; [182] [183] the terms were later repeated in the 1945 Potsdam Declaration [184] that Japan agreed to carry out in its instrument of surrender [185] [186] On 25 October 1945, Japan surrendered Taiwan to the ROC, and in the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan formally renounced their claims to the islands, though without specifying to whom they were surrendered [187] [188] [189] [190] [q] In the same year, Japan and the ROC signed a peace treaty [191]\n\n\nMartial law era (1949–1987)\nMartial law, declared on Taiwan in May 1949, [210] continued to be in effect until 1987, [210] [211] and was used to suppress political opposition During the White Terror, as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist [212] Many citizens were arrested, tortured, imprisoned or executed for their real or perceived link to the Chinese Communist Party Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an entire generation of political and social leaders was destroyed.\n\n\nTransition to democracy\nAfter Chiang Ching-kuo's death in 1988, Lee Teng-hui became the first president of the ROC born in Taiwan [241] Lee's administration oversaw a period of democratization in which the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion were abolished and the Additional Articles of the Constitution were introduced [242] [243] Congressional representation was allocated to only the Taiwan Area, [244] and Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint [245] while assimilationist policies were replaced with support for multiculturalism [246] In 1996, Lee was re-elected in the first direct presidential election [247] During Lee's administration, both he and his party were involved in corruption controversies that came to be known as \"black gold\" politics [248] [249] [250]\n\n\nGeography\nThe land controlled by the ROC consists of 168 islands [n] with a combined area of 36,193 square kilometres (13,974 sq mi) [17] [39] [i] The main island, known historically as Formosa, makes up 99 percent of this area, measuring 35,808 square kilometres (13,826 sq mi) and lying some 180 kilometres (112 mi) across the Taiwan Strait from the southeastern coast of mainland China The East China Sea lies to its north, the Philippine Sea to its east, the Luzon Strait directly to its south and the South China Sea to its southwest Smaller islands include the Penghu Islands in the Taiwan Strait, the Kinmen, Matsu and Wuqiu islands near the Chinese coast, and some of the South China Sea islands.\n\n\nClimate\nTaiwan lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical [14] The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical and the mountainous regions are temperate [274] The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June [275] The entire island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September Typhoons are most common in July, August and September [275] During the winter (November to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern parts of the island are mostly sunny.\n\n\nGeology\nThe island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine Mobile Belt on the east and south The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant [278]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe government of the Republic of China was founded on the 1947 Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people\" [281] It underwent significant revisions in the 1990s, known collectively as the Additional Articles The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).\n\n\nGovernment\nThe government of the Republic of China was founded on the 1947 Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people\" [281] It underwent significant revisions in the 1990s, known collectively as the Additional Articles The government is divided into five branches (Yuan): the Executive Yuan (cabinet), the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).\n\n\nConstitution\nThe constitution was drafted by the KMT while the ROC still governed the Chinese mainland [287] Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s resulted in the end of martial law in 1987, and Taiwan transformed into a multiparty democracy in the early 1990s The constitutional basis for this transition to democracy was gradually laid in the Additional Articles of the Constitution These articles suspended portions of the Constitution designed for the governance of mainland China and replacing them with articles adapted for the governance of and guaranteeing the political rights of residents of the Taiwan Area, as defined in the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area [288]\n\n\nMajor camps\nTaiwan's political scene is divided into two major camps in terms of cross-Strait relations, i.e how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC The Pan-Green Coalition (e.g the Democratic Progressive Party) leans pro-independence, and the Pan-Blue Coalition (e.g the Kuomintang) leans pro-unification [296] Moderates in both camps regard the Republic of China as a sovereign independent state, but the Pan-Green Coalition regard the ROC as synonymous with Taiwan, [297] while moderates in the Pan-Blue Coalition view it as synonymous with China [298] These positions formed against the backdrop of the PRC's Anti-Secession Law, which threatens the use of \"non-peaceful means\" to respond to formal Taiwanese independence [299] The ROC government has understood this to mean a military invasion of Taiwan [300]\n\n\nNational identity\nRoughly 84 percent of Taiwan's population are descendants of Han Chinese immigrants between 1683 and 1895 Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s The shared cultural origin as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones.\n\n\nPublic opinion\nDomestic public opinion has preferred maintaining the status quo, though pro-independence sentiment has steadily risen since 1994 In June 2021, an annual poll found that 28.2 percent supported the status quo and postponing a decision, 27.5 percent supported maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 25.8 percent supported the status quo with a move toward independence, 5.9 percent supported the status quo with a move toward unification, 5.7 percent gave no response, 5.6 percent supported independence as soon as possible, and 1.5 percent supported unification as soon as possible [317] A referendum question in 2018 asked if Taiwan's athletes should compete under \"Taiwan\" in the 2020 Summer Olympics but did not pass; the New York Times attributed the failure to a campaign cautioning that a name change might lead to Taiwan being banned \"under Chinese pressure\" [318]\n\n\nForeign relations and international status\nThe political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory and that the PRC replaced the ROC government in 1949, becoming the sole legal government of China [81] The ROC, however, has its own currency, widely accepted passport, postage stamps, internet TLD, armed forces and constitution with an independently elected president [329] It has not formally renounced its claim to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed this historical claim [330]\n\n\nRelations with the PRC\nThe Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of Taiwan is responsible for relations with the PRC, while the Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) of the PRC is responsible for relations with Taiwan Exchanges are conducted through private organizations both founded in 1991: the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of Taiwan and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) of the PRC.\n\n\nParticipation in international events and organizations\nThe ROC was a founding member of United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution 2758 and replaced with the PRC as the ROC now has neither official membership nor observer status in the organization Since 1993, the ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it past committee stage [364] [365] Due to the One China policy, most UN member states, including the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC's political status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC [366]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Republic of China Armed Forces takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army, which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1924 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang When the People's Liberation Army won the Chinese Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government The 1947 Constitution of the ROC reformed it into the Republic of China Armed Forces, making it the national army rather than the army of a political party Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\n\nLGBT rights\nOn 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that then-current marriage laws had been violating the Constitution by denying same-sex couples the right to marry The Court ruled that if the Legislative Yuan did not pass adequate amendments to Taiwanese marriage laws within two years, same-sex marriages would automatically become lawful in Taiwan [416] In a referendum question in 2018, however, voters expressed overwhelming opposition to same-sex marriage and supported the removal of content about homosexuality from primary school textbooks According to the New York Times, the referendum questions were subject to a \"well-funded and highly organized campaign led by conservative Christians and other groups\" involving the use of misinformation [318] Nevertheless, the vote against same-sex marriage does not affect the court ruling, and on 17 May 2019, Taiwan's parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, making it the first country in Asia to do so [417] [418] [419]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAccording to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing national boundaries\" [422] The ROC is, de jure constitutionally, divided into provinces  [zh], special municipalities (which are further divided into districts for local administration), and the province-level Tibet Area Each province is subdivided into cities and counties, which are further divided into townships and county-administered cities, each having elected mayors and city councilors who share duties with the county Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighborhoods The provinces have been \"streamlined\" and are no longer functional [423] Similarly, Mongol banners for China's Inner Mongolia also existed, [292] but they were abolished in 2006 and the ROC reaffirmed its recognition of Mongolia (formerly known as Outer Mongolia in Taiwan) in 2002, as stipulated in the 1946 constitution [424] [425] [426]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe quick industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the 20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\" Taiwan is one of the \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore As of October 2022, Taiwan is the 21st largest economy in the world by nominal GDP [428]\n\n\nTransport\nThe Ministry of Transportation and Communications of Taiwan is the cabinet-level governing body of the transport network in Taiwan Civilian transport in Taiwan is characterized by extensive use of scooters In March 2019, 13.86 million were registered, twice that of cars [449] Both highways and railways are concentrated near the coasts, where the majority of the population resides, with 1,619 km (1,006 mi) of motorway Railways in Taiwan are primarily used for passenger services, with Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) operating a circular route around the island and Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) running high speed services on the west coast Urban transit systems include Taipei Metro, Kaohsiung Metro, Taoyuan Metro, New Taipei Metro, and Taichung Metro.\n\n\nDemographics\nTaiwan has a population of about 23.4 million, [452] most of whom are on the island of Taiwan The remainder live on the outlying islands of Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506) [453]\n\n\nLargest cities and counties\nThe figures below are the March 2019 estimates for the twenty most populous administrative divisions; a different ranking exists when considering the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung metro area is by far the largest agglomeration) The figures reflect the number of household registrations in each city, which may differ from the number of actual residents.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe ROC government reports that 95 percent of the population is ethnically Han Chinese [454] There are also 2.4 percent indigenous Austronesian peoples and 2.6 percent new immigrants primarily from China and Southeast Asia [455]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe Republic of China does not have any legally designated official language Mandarin is the primary language used in business and education, and is spoken by the vast majority of the population Traditional Chinese is used as the writing system [461]\n\n\nReligion\nEstimated religious composition in 2020: [13]\n\n\nEducation\nTaiwan is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education as a means to improve one's socioeconomic position in society [484] [485] Heavy investment and a cultural valuing of education has made the resource-poor nation to be consistently ranked to the top of global education rankings Taiwan is one of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences In 2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), with the average student scoring 519, compared with the OECD average of 493, placing it seventh in the world [486] [487] [488]\n\n\nHealth\nThe current healthcare system, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995 NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan that centralizes the disbursement of healthcare funds The system promises equal access to healthcare for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99 percent by the end of 2004 [506] NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket co-payments and direct government funding [507] [508] [509] Low-income families, veterans, centenarians, children under three, and catastrophic diseases are exempt from co-payments Co-pays are reduced for disabled and low-income households maintain 100 percent premium coverage.\n\n\nCulture\nThe cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid blend from various sources, incorporating elements of the majority traditional Chinese culture, aboriginal cultures, Japanese cultural influence, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and increasingly, Western values.\n\n\nArts\nAcclaimed classical musicians include violinist Cho-Liang Lin, pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society artist director Wu Han Other musicians include Teresa Teng, Jay Chou and groups such as Mayday and heavy metal band Chthonic, led by singer Freddy Lim, which has been referred to as the \"Black Sabbath of Asia\" [526] [527]\n\n\nPopular culture\nKaraoke is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV [529] KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs Tour busses that travel around Taiwan have several TVs, primarily for singing karaoke.\n\n\nCuisine\nTaiwanese culinary history is murky and is intricately tied to patterns of migration and colonization Local and international Taiwanese cuisine, including its history, is a politically contentious topic Famous Taiwanese dishes include Taiwanese beef noodle soup, Gua bao, Zongzi, Khong bah png, Taiwanese fried chicken, oyster vermicelli, Sanbeiji, and Aiyu jelly [534] Bubble tea, created in Taiwan in the 1980s, has now become popular globally [535] In 2014, The Guardian called Taiwanese night markets the \"best street food markets in the world\" [536] The Michelin Guide began reviewing restaurants in Taiwan in 2018 [537]\n\n\nSports\nBaseball is commonly considered Taiwan's national sport and is a popular spectator sport [538] The men's team won medals across all levels of baseball in 2022, including the U-12, U-15, U-18, U-23, and Baseball5 competitions, the only team to do so in baseball history [539] The results made Taiwan's national baseball team one of the top-ranked teams in the WBSC World Rankings Professional baseball in Taiwan started with the founding of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in 1989 [540] As of 2024, the CPBL has six teams, with an average attendance of over 7,000 per game [541] [542] Some elite players signed with overseas professional teams in the Major League Baseball (MLB) or the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) There have been seventeen Taiwanese MLB players as of the 2024 MLB season, including former pitchers Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen As for variations of baseball, Taiwan also has a strong women's softball team The Chinese Taipei women's national softball team won a bronze medal at the 2022 World Games [543]\n\n\nCalendar\nThe standard Gregorian calendar is used for most purposes The year is often denoted by the Minguo era system which starts in 1912, the year the ROC was founded 2024 is year 113 Minguo (民國113年) The East Asian date format is used in Chinese [560] Prior to standardization in 1929, the Chinese calendar was officially used It is a Lunisolar calendar system which remains in use for traditional festivals such as the Lunar New Year, the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival [561]\n\n\nSee also\nNote: The Senkaku Islands (known as \"Diaoyu\" or \"Diaoyutai\" in standard Chinese), which are an archipelago of 8 islands and islets in

Born and raised in Bihar, Kishor has worked with various political parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and has been credited with formulating innovative marketing and advertising campaigns for several high-profile politicians.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nPrashant Kishor was born to Shrikant Pandey, a physician, and Sushila Pandey, a homemaker. He hails from the Konar village, Sasaram of Rohtas district, Bihar, India. Later, Kishor moved to Buxar, Bihar, where he completed his secondary education. After completing his studies, Kishor pursued a career in social work and politics, eventually becoming a prominent figure in Indian politics.\n\nKishor is married to Jahnavi Das, a physician hailing from Guwahati, Assam, with whom he has a son. The couple's marriage is a testament to the growing trend of inter-regional relationships in India, where people from different parts of the country are coming together to build a life.\n\n**Work as a Political Strategist**\n\nKishor's entry into politics was marked by his work as a political strategist for the BJP's pre-election campaign in the 2012 Gujarat Assembly Election and the 2014 Lok Sabha Election. During this period, Kishor reportedly worked pro bono, without holding any office in the BJP or the Gujarat Government. His work was instrumental in shaping the party's campaign strategy, which ultimately led to the BJP's victory in the elections.\n\nIn 2013, Kishor co-founded Citizens for Accountable Governance (CAG), a media and publicity company, in preparation for the May 2014 general election of India. Along with other members, Kishor worked tirelessly to formulate an innovative marketing and advertising campaign for Narendra Modi, the then-Chief Minister of Gujarat. The campaign, which included the Chai Pe Charcha discussions, 3D rallies, Run for Unity, Manthan, and several social media programs, was widely credited with contributing to Modi's success in the elections.\n\n**Retirement and Jan Suraaj**\n\nAfter the win of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) in the 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, Kishor declared that he was quitting as an election strategist. In an interview with NDTV on 2 May 2021, Kishor told anchor Sreenivasan Jain on live TV, \"I do not want to continue what I am doing. I have done enough. Time for me to take a break and do something else in life. I want to quit this space.\"\n\nHowever, a year later, on 2 May 2022, Kishor hinted toward the formation of a political outfit of his own with a tweet that said it was time to go to the \"Real Masters, The People\" and on the path of \"Jan Suraaj-Peoples Good Governance.\" Kishor later announced a 3,000 km Padyatra which would take place across Bihar, and would involve Kishor meeting with people from all across the state. The \"Padyatra\" is taking place under his \"Jan Suraaj Padyatra\" campaign, one of the stated goals of which is to form a political party, which he estimates would fight its first election in the 2025 Bihar Legislative Assembly.\n\nOn 2 October 2024, Kishor announced the Jan Suraaj campaign as a formal political party, which will be known as the Jan Suraaj Party. The party's launch marks a significant development in Indian politics, as Kishor's entry into the electoral fray is likely to shake up the existing party dynamics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPrashant Kishor's entry into politics has been marked by his work as a political strategist and social worker.

Born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey, Mu's success in track and field has been marked by numerous records and titles, including becoming the first American woman to win the 800 meters world championship title and the youngest woman in history to own Olympic and world titles in an individual track and field event.\n\n# Early Life\n\nAthing Mu was born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey, and is the second youngest of seven siblings. Her parents, who immigrated to the United States from South Sudan, have a significant influence on her life and athletic career. Growing up in a large family, Mu learned the importance of teamwork and perseverance, values that have contributed to her success in track and field.\n\nAt the age of 6, Mu began competing in track, and her natural talent and dedication quickly made her a standout in the sport. As she grew older, Mu's passion for track and field only intensified, and she went on to compete for the Trenton Track Club.\n\n# Career\n\n## 2019\n\nOn February 24, 2019, Mu made history by breaking the American women's record in the 600 meters event at the 2019 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships with a time of 1:23.57. This achievement marked a significant milestone in Mu's career, as she bested the previous American women's record of 1:23.59 held by Alysia Montaño. Mu's remarkable performance also brought her close to the women's world record of 1:23.44, held by Olga Kotlyarova.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, Mu continued to impress with her outstanding performances. On February 6, she ran a 50.52-second 400 meters, a time that was 0.3 seconds faster than Sanya Richards' official world under-20 record ratified by World Athletics. Although Mu's time was slower than the 50.36 seconds set by fellow American Sydney McLaughlin, which did not meet the standards for world record ratification, her achievement still demonstrated her exceptional talent.\n\nOn February 27, Mu set an indoor collegiate and world under-20 record in the 800 meters with a time of 1:58.40. This record-breaking performance not only solidified Mu's position as a top contender in the 800 meters event but also highlighted her versatility as an athlete.\n\nIn April, Mu set the 800 meter USA collegiate record with a time of 1:57.73, showcasing her dominance in the event. Her impressive performance continued at the 2021 NCAA Championships in Eugene, Oregon, where she won the 400m with a collegiate all-time record mark of 49.57 seconds. Mu also anchored the Texas A&M Women's 4 × 400 m relay squad to victory and a new collegiate record of 3:22.34.\n\n## 2022\n\nAt the World Championships in Eugene, Oregon, Mu faced stiff competition in the 800 meters event, but she proved to be the strongest. With a world-leading time of 1:56.30, Mu won the gold medal by a narrow margin of 0.08 seconds over Hodgkinson. This achievement made her the first American woman to win the 800 meters world championship title and the youngest woman in history to own Olympic and world titles in an individual track and field event.\n\n## 2023\n\nIn 2023, Mu continued to compete at the highest level. At the 2023 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Mu placed second in the 1500 meters, a performance that earned her automatic qualification for the year's world championships in the 800 meters. However, her participation in the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, was uncertain.\n\nMu did compete in the 800 meters at the World Championships, placing third behind Mary Moraa and Keely Hodgkinson. Despite her impressive performance, Mu's time was slower than her personal best. At the 2023 Prefontaine Classic, Mu won the Diamond League final in a time of 1:54.97, setting an American record and defeating Moraa and Hodgkinson in the process.\n\n## 2024\n\nAfter a nine-month hiatus, Mu returned to competition at the 2024 United States Olympic trials, but her performance was marred by a fall in the 800 meters final. As a result, Mu did not qualify for the Olympics, where she would have defended her gold medal from three years prior.\n\n# Achievements\n\n* First American woman to win the 800 meters world championship title\n* Youngest woman in history to own Olympic and world titles in an individual track and field event\n* Set the American record in the 800 meters with a time of 1:54.97\n* Won the Diamond League final in the 800 meters\n* Set the indoor collegiate and world under-20 record in the 800 meters with a time of 1:58.40\n* Set the 800 meter USA collegiate record with a time of 1:57.73\n* Won the 400m at the 2021 NCAA Championships with a collegiate all-time record mark of 49.57 seconds\n* Anchored the Texas A&M Women's 4 × 400 m relay squad to victory and a new collegiate record of 3:22.34\n\n# Personal Bests\n\n* 400 meters: 49.57 seconds\n* 800 meters: 1:54.97\n* 1500 meters: 3:56.35\n\n# International Competitions\n\n* World Championships:\n\t+ 2022: 800 meters -

as a composite deity is not well documented, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation [61] According to Vijay Nath:\n\n\nAssimilation of traditions\nThe Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the Indian subcontinent, such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, [57] and Southeast Asia, such as Bali, Indonesia [58] Shiva has pre-Vedic tribal roots, [26] having

much speculation [61] According to Vijay Nath:\n\n\nPre-Vedic elements\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the Mesolithic from Bhimbetka rock shelters have been interpreted by some authors as depictions of Shiva [71] [b] However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways [72]\n\n\nPrehistoric art\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the Mesolithic from Bhimbetka rock shelters have been interpreted by

and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways [72]\n\n\nIndus Valley and the Pashupati seal\nOf several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic, [note 2] [73] seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as Pashupati (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit paśupati), [74] an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra [75] Sir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined [76] Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion [77]\n\n\nProto-Indo-European elements\nThe Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, [84] and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion [85] The similarities between the iconography and theologies of Shiva with Greek and European deities have led to proposals for an Indo-European link for Shiva, [86] [87] or lateral exchanges with ancient central Asian cultures [88] [89] His contrasting aspects such as being terrifying or blissful depending on the situation, are similar to those of the Greek god Dionysus, [90] as are their iconic associations with bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing and carefree life [91] [92] The ancient Greek texts of the time of Alexander the Great call Shiva \"Indian Dionysus\", or alternatively call Dionysus \"god of the Orient\" [91] Similarly, the use of phallic symbol [note 2] as an icon for Shiva is also found for Irish, Nordic, Greek (Dionysus [93]) and Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward [86] Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous pre-Aryan tribal origins [94]\n\n\nRudra\nShiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, [95] and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures The two names are used synonymously Rudra, a Rigvedic deity with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring storm He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity [96] In RV 2.33, he is described as the \"Father of the Rudras\", a group of storm gods [97] [98]\n\n\nAgni\nRudra and Agni have a close relationship [note 3] The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual transformation into Rudra-Shiva [note 4] The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the Nirukta, an important early text on etymology, which says, \"Agni is also called Rudra.\" [107] The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:\n\n\nIndra\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the Saivite fertility myths and some of the phallic characteristics of Shiva are inherited from Indra [113] Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, the Supreme Self In the Rig Veda the term śiva is used to refer to Indra (2.20.3, [note 6] 6.45.17, [115] [116] and 8.93.3 [117]) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull [118] [119] In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra [120]\n\n\nDevelopment\nA few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible [125] The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who \"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart [126]\n\n\nPosition within Hinduism\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is [15] [16] He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions [15] Shiva is also Part of 'Om' (ॐ) as a 'U' (उ) [149]\n\n\nShaivism\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is [15] [16] He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions [15] Shiva is also Part of 'Om' (ॐ) as a 'U' (उ) [149]\n\n\nVaishnavism\nThe Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents Vishnu as supreme However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the Bhagavata Purana while praising Krishna as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalized form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality [158] [159] [160] The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu The Skanda Purana, for example, states:\n\n\nShaktism\nThe goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), [166] [167] [168] but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner [169] This partner is Shiva [170] [171]\n\n\nSmarta tradition\nIn the Smarta tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is a part of its Panchayatana puja [181] This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent, [181] set in a quincunx pattern [182] Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference (Ishta Devata) [183]\n\n\nYoga\nShiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself – the transcendental reality He is the Lord of Yogis, and the teacher of Yoga to sages [187] As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme guru who \"teaches in silence the oneness of one's innermost self (atman) with the ultimate reality (brahman).\" [188] Shiva is also an archetype for samhara (Sanskrit: संहार) or dissolution which includes transcendence of human misery by the dissolution of maya, which is why Shiva is associated with Yoga [189] [190]\n\n\nTrimurti\nThe Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer [196] [197] These three deities have been called \"the Hindu triad\" [198] or the \"Great Triple deity\" [199] However, the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism feature many triads of gods and goddesses, some of which do not include Shiva [200]\n\n\nAttributes\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology [248]\n\n\nForms and depictions\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology [248]\n\n\nDestroyer and Benefactor\nIn Yajurveda, two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: rudra) and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: śiva) forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that \"all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-Śiva sect of later ages are to be found here\" [250] In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\", as well as a figure of honor, delight, and brilliance [251]\n\n\nAscetic and householder\nShiva is depicted as both an ascetic yogi and as a householder (grihasta), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society [261] When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating [262] His epithet Mahāyogi (\"the great Yogi: Mahā = \"great\", Yogi = \"one who practices Yoga\") refers to his association with yoga [263] While Vedic religion was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the Epic period that the concepts of tapas, yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts [264]\n\n\nIconographic forms\nThe depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Sanskrit नटराज; Naṭarāja) is a form (mūrti) of Shiva as \"Lord of Dance\" [278] [279] The names Nartaka (\"dancer\") and Nityanarta (\"eternal dancer\") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama [280] His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the Puranic period [281] In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: nṛtyamūrti) are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular [282] The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava, [283] and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati [284] [285] Lasya is regarded as the female counterpart of Tandava [285] The Tandava-Lasya dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world [286] [287] [288]\n\n\nLingam\nThe Linga Purana states, \"Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless\" [311] The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature [311] The Linga Purana and the Shiva Gita texts builds on this foundation [312] [313] Linga, states Alain Daniélou, means sign [311] It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something It accompanies the concept of Brahman, which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less [311]\n\n\nAvatars\nPuranic scriptures contain occasional references to \"ansh\" – literally 'portion, or avatars of Shiva', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in Shaivism [335] The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars, [336] however such mention is unusual and the avatars of Shiva is relatively rare in Shaivism compared to the well emphasized concept of Vishnu avatars in Vaishnavism [337] [338] [339]\nSome Vaishnava literature reverentially link Shiva to characters in its Puranas For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva [340] [341] [342] The Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva [343] [344] [345] Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva [346]\n\n\nTemple\nThere is a Shivaratri in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day, [347] but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks Maha Shivaratri which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\" [348]\n\n\nFestivals\nThere is a Shivaratri in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day, [347] but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks Maha Shivaratri which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\" [348]\n\n\nBeyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been Batara Guru, which is derived from Sanskrit Bhattāraka which means \"noble lord\" [363] He is conceptualized as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent [364] However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him Batara Guru's wife in Southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualized with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others [365] [366] In contrast to Hindu religious texts, whether Vedas or Puranas, in Javanese puppetry (wayang) books, Batara Guru is the king of the gods who regulates and creates the world system In the classic book that is used as a reference for the puppeteers, it is said that Sanghyang Manikmaya or Batara Guru was created from a sparkling light by Sang Hyang Tunggal, along with the blackish light which is the origin of Ismaya [367] [368] Shiva has been called Sadāśiva, Paramasiva, Mahādeva in benevolent forms, and Kāla, Bhairava, Mahākāla in his fierce forms [366]\n\n\nIndonesia\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been Batara Guru, which is derived from Sanskrit Bhattāraka which means \"noble

became popular in Central Asia through the influence of the Hephthalite Empire [373] and Kushan Empire Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan [374] In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (Yajnopavita) [374] He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress [374] A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh [374] [375] Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls [374] It is also noted that the Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva [375]\n\n\nSikhism\nThe Japuji Sahib of the Guru Granth Sahib says: \"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi.\" [376] In the same chapter, it also says: \"Shiva speaks, and the Siddhas listen.\" In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh has mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar [377]\n\n\nBuddhism\nShiva is mentioned in the Buddhist Tantras and worshipped as the fierce deity Mahākāla in Vajrayana, Chinese Esoteric, and Tibetan Buddhism [378] In the cosmologies of Buddhist Tantras, Shiva is depicted as passive, with Shakti being his active counterpart: Shiva as Prajña and Shakti as Upāya [379] [380]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn contemporary culture, Shiva is depicted in art, films, and books He has been referred to as \"the god of cool things\" [391] and a \"bonafide rock hero\" [392] One popular film was the 1967 Kannada movie Gange Gowri [393]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\nFurther

Nath:\n\n\nAssimilation of traditions\nThe Shiva-related tradition is a major part of Hinduism, found all over the Indian subcontinent, such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, [57] and Southeast Asia, such as Bali, Indonesia [58] Shiva has pre-Vedic tribal roots, [26] having \"his origins in primitive tribes, signs and symbols.\" [59] The figure of Shiva as he is known today is an amalgamation of various older deities into a single figure, due to the process of Sanskritization and the emergence of the Hindu synthesis in post-Vedic times [60] How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented, a challenge to trace and has attracted much speculation [61] According to Vijay Nath:\n\n\nPre-Vedic elements\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the Mesolithic from Bhimbetka rock shelters have been interpreted by some authors as depictions of Shiva [71] [b] However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways [72]\n\n\nPrehistoric art\nPrehistoric rock paintings dating to the

their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in many different ways [72]\n\n\nIndus Valley and the Pashupati seal\nOf several Indus valley seals that show animals, one seal that has attracted attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic, [note 2] [73] seated in a posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as Pashupati (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit paśupati), [74] an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra [75] Sir John Marshall and others suggested that this figure is a prototype of Shiva, with three faces, seated in a \"yoga posture\" with the knees out and feet joined [76] Semi-circular shapes on the head were interpreted as two horns Scholars such as Gavin Flood, John Keay and Doris Meth Srinivasan have expressed doubts about this suggestion [77]\n\n\nProto-Indo-European elements\nThe Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, [84] and the pre-Islamic Indo-Iranian religion [85] The similarities between the iconography and theologies of Shiva with Greek and European deities have led to proposals for an Indo-European link for Shiva, [86] [87] or lateral exchanges with ancient central Asian cultures [88] [89] His contrasting aspects such as being terrifying or blissful depending on the situation, are similar to those of the Greek god Dionysus, [90] as are their iconic associations with bull, snakes, anger, bravery, dancing and carefree life [91] [92] The ancient Greek texts of the time of Alexander the Great call Shiva \"Indian Dionysus\", or alternatively call Dionysus \"god of the Orient\" [91] Similarly, the use of phallic symbol [note 2] as an icon for Shiva is also found for Irish, Nordic, Greek (Dionysus [93]) and Roman deities, as was the idea of this aniconic column linking heaven and earth among early Indo-Aryans, states Roger Woodward [86] Others contest such proposals, and suggest Shiva to have emerged from indigenous pre-Aryan tribal origins [94]\n\n\nRudra\nShiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god Rudra, [95] and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures The two names are used synonymously Rudra, a Rigvedic deity with fearsome powers, was the god of the roaring storm He is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity [96] In RV 2.33, he is described as the \"Father of the Rudras\", a group of storm gods [97] [98]\n\n\nAgni\nRudra and Agni have a close relationship [note 3] The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual transformation into Rudra-Shiva [note 4] The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the Nirukta, an important early text on etymology, which says, \"Agni is also called Rudra.\" [107] The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:\n\n\nIndra\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the Saivite fertility myths and some of the phallic characteristics of Shiva are inherited from Indra [113] Doniger gives several reasons for her hypothesis Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, the transgression of established mores, the Aum sound, the Supreme Self In the Rig Veda the term śiva is used to refer to Indra (2.20.3, [note 6] 6.45.17, [115] [116] and 8.93.3 [117]) Indra, like Shiva, is likened to a bull [118] [119] In the Rig Veda, Rudra is the father of the Maruts, but he is never associated with their warlike exploits as is Indra [120]\n\n\nDevelopment\nA few texts such as Atharvashiras Upanishad mention Rudra, and assert all gods are Rudra, everyone and everything is Rudra, and Rudra is the principle found in all things, their highest goal, the innermost essence of all reality that is visible or invisible [125] The Kaivalya Upanishad similarly, states Paul Deussen – a German Indologist and professor of philosophy, describes the self-realized man as who \"feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all\", who feels identity of his and everyone's consciousness with Shiva (highest Atman), who has found this highest Atman within, in the depths of his heart [126]\n\n\nPosition within Hinduism\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is [15] [16] He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions [15] Shiva is also Part of 'Om' (ॐ) as a 'U' (उ) [149]\n\n\nShaivism\nShaivism is one of the four major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition Followers of Shaivism, called \"Shaivas\", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is [15] [16] He is not only the creator in Shaivism, but he is also the creation that results from him, he is everything and everywhere Shiva is the primal Self, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions [15] Shiva is also Part of 'Om' (ॐ) as a 'U' (उ) [149]\n\n\nVaishnavism\nThe Vaishnava (Vishnu-oriented) literature acknowledges and discusses Shiva Like Shaiva literature that presents Shiva as supreme, the Vaishnava literature presents Vishnu as supreme However, both traditions are pluralistic and revere both Shiva and Vishnu (along with Devi), their texts do not show exclusivism, and Vaishnava texts such as the Bhagavata Purana while praising Krishna as the Ultimate Reality, also present Shiva and Shakti as a personalized form an equivalent to the same Ultimate Reality [158] [159] [160] The texts of Shaivism tradition similarly praise Vishnu The Skanda Purana, for example, states:\n\n\nShaktism\nThe goddess-oriented Shakti tradition of Hinduism is based on the premise that the Supreme Principle and the Ultimate Reality called Brahman is female (Devi), [166] [167] [168] but it treats the male as her equal and complementary partner [169] This partner is Shiva [170] [171]\n\n\nSmarta tradition\nIn the Smarta tradition of Hinduism, Shiva is a part of its Panchayatana puja [181] This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent, [181] set in a quincunx pattern [182] Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference (Ishta Devata) [183]\n\n\nYoga\nShiva is considered the Great Yogi who is totally absorbed in himself – the transcendental reality He is the Lord of Yogis, and the teacher of Yoga to sages [187] As Shiva Dakshinamurthi, states Stella Kramrisch, he is the supreme guru who \"teaches in silence the oneness of one's innermost self (atman) with the ultimate reality (brahman).\" [188] Shiva is also an archetype for samhara (Sanskrit: संहार) or dissolution which includes transcendence of human misery by the dissolution of maya, which is why Shiva is associated with Yoga [189] [190]\n\n\nTrimurti\nThe Trimurti is a concept in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver and Shiva the destroyer or transformer [196] [197] These three deities have been called \"the Hindu triad\" [198] or the \"Great Triple deity\" [199] However, the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism feature many triads of gods and goddesses, some of which do not include Shiva [200]\n\n\nAttributes\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology [248]\n\n\nForms and depictions\nShiva is often depicted as embodying attributes of ambiguity and paradox His depictions are marked by the opposing themes including fierceness and innocence This duality can be seen in the diverse epithets attributed to him and the rich tapestry of narratives that delineate his persona within Hindu mythology [248]\n\n\nDestroyer and Benefactor\nIn Yajurveda, two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrifying (Sanskrit: rudra) and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: śiva) forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that \"all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-Śiva sect of later ages are to be found here\" [250] In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as \"the standard of invincibility, might, and terror\", as well as a figure of honor, delight, and brilliance [251]\n\n\nAscetic and householder\nShiva is depicted as both an ascetic yogi and as a householder (grihasta), roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society [261] When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating [262] His epithet Mahāyogi (\"the great Yogi: Mahā = \"great\", Yogi = \"one who practices Yoga\") refers to his association with yoga [263] While Vedic religion was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the Epic period that the concepts of tapas, yoga, and asceticism became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts [264]\n\n\nIconographic forms\nThe depiction of Shiva as Nataraja (Sanskrit नटराज; Naṭarāja) is a form (mūrti) of Shiva as \"Lord of Dance\" [278] [279] The names Nartaka (\"dancer\") and Nityanarta (\"eternal dancer\") appear in the Shiva Sahasranama [280] His association with dance and also with music is prominent in the Puranic period [281] In addition to the specific iconographic form known as Nataraja, various other types of dancing forms (Sanskrit: nṛtyamūrti) are found in all parts of India, with many well-defined varieties in Tamil Nadu in particular [282] The two most common forms of the dance are the Tandava, which later came to denote the powerful and masculine dance as Kala-Mahakala associated with the destruction of the world When it requires the world or universe to be destroyed, Shiva does it by the Tandava, [283] and Lasya, which is graceful and delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level and is considered the feminine dance attributed to the goddess Parvati [284] [285] Lasya is regarded as the female counterpart of Tandava [285] The Tandava-Lasya dances are associated with the destruction-creation of the world [286] [287] [288]\n\n\nLingam\nThe Linga Purana states, \"Shiva is signless, without color, taste, smell, that is beyond word or touch, without quality, motionless and changeless\" [311] The source of the universe is the signless, and all of the universe is the manifested Linga, a union of unchanging Principles and the ever changing nature [311] The Linga Purana and the Shiva Gita texts builds on this foundation [312] [313] Linga, states Alain Daniélou, means sign [311] It is an important concept in Hindu texts, wherein Linga is a manifested sign and nature of someone or something It accompanies the concept of Brahman, which as invisible signless and existent Principle, is formless or linga-less [311]\n\n\nAvatars\nPuranic scriptures contain occasional references to \"ansh\" – literally 'portion, or avatars of Shiva', but the idea of Shiva avatars is not universally accepted in Shaivism [335] The Linga Purana mentions twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars, [336] however such mention is unusual and the avatars of Shiva is relatively rare in Shaivism compared to the well emphasized concept of Vishnu avatars in Vaishnavism [337] [338] [339]\nSome Vaishnava literature reverentially link Shiva to characters in its Puranas For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman is identified as the eleventh avatar of Shiva [340] [341] [342] The Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana claim sage Durvasa to be a portion of Shiva [343] [344] [345] Some medieval era writers have called the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara an incarnation of Shiva [346]\n\n\nTemple\nThere is a Shivaratri in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day, [347] but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks Maha Shivaratri which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\" [348]\n\n\nFestivals\nThere is a Shivaratri in every lunar month on its 13th night/14th day, [347] but once a year in late winter (February/March) and before the arrival of spring, marks Maha Shivaratri which means \"the Great Night of Shiva\" [348]\n\n\nBeyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been Batara Guru, which is derived from Sanskrit Bhattāraka which means \"noble lord\" [363] He is conceptualized as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent [364] However, the Batara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him Batara Guru's wife in Southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualized with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others [365] [366] In contrast to Hindu religious texts, whether Vedas or Puranas, in Javanese puppetry (wayang) books, Batara Guru is the king of the gods who regulates and creates the world system In the classic book that is used as a reference for the puppeteers, it is said that Sanghyang Manikmaya or Batara Guru was created from a sparkling light by Sang Hyang Tunggal, along with the blackish light which is the origin of Ismaya [367] [368] Shiva has been called Sadāśiva, Paramasiva, Mahādeva in benevolent forms, and Kāla, Bhairava, Mahākāla in his fierce forms [366]\n\n\nIndonesia\nIn Indonesian Shaivism the popular name for Shiva has been Batara Guru, which is derived from Sanskrit Bhattāraka which means \"noble

became popular in Central Asia through the influence of the Hephthalite Empire [373] and Kushan Empire Shaivism was also popular in Sogdia and the Kingdom of Yutian as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan [374] In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread (Yajnopavita) [374] He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sogdian dress [374] A panel from Dandan Oilik shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with Shakti kneeling on her right thigh [374] [375] Another site in the Taklamakan Desert depicts him with four legs, seated cross-legged on a cushioned seat supported by two bulls [374] It is also noted that the Zoroastrian wind god Vayu-Vata took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva [375]\n\n\nSikhism\nThe Japuji Sahib of the Guru Granth Sahib says: \"The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi.\" [376] In the same chapter, it also says: \"Shiva speaks, and the Siddhas listen.\" In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh has mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar [377]\n\n\nBuddhism\nShiva is mentioned in the Buddhist Tantras and worshipped as the fierce deity Mahākāla in Vajrayana, Chinese Esoteric, and Tibetan Buddhism [378] In the cosmologies of Buddhist Tantras, Shiva is depicted as passive, with Shakti being his active counterpart: Shiva as Prajña and Shakti as Upāya [379] [380]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn contemporary culture, Shiva is depicted in art, films, and books He has been referred to as \"the god of cool things\" [391] and a \"bonafide rock hero\" [392] One popular film was the 1967 Kannada movie Gange Gowri [393]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\nFurther

Charles I [23] Lord Baltimore initially proposed the name \"Crescentia\", the land of growth or increase, but \"the King proposed Terra Mariae  [Mary Land], which was concluded on and inserted in the bill.\" [15]\n\n\nPersecution of Catholics\nMaryland was founded to provide a haven for England's Roman Catholic minority [27]\nAlthough Maryland was the most heavily Catholic of the English mainland colonies, the religion was still in the minority, consisting of less than 10% of the total population [28]\n\n\nBorder disputes (1681–1760)\nThe royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel But the grant indicated that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle, Delaware when it falls north of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.\n\n\n18th century\nMost of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as indentured servants, and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage [33] In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662.\n\n\n19th century\nInfluenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the Revolutionary War Across the Upper South the free black population increased from less than 1% before the war to 14% by 1810 [35] Abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass were born slaves during this time in Dorchester County and Talbot County, respectively [36] [37]\n\n\nCivil War\nThe state remained in the Union during the American Civil War, [40] due in significant part to demographics and Federal intervention The 1860 census, held shortly before the outbreak of the civil war, showed that 49% of Maryland's African Americans were free [35]\n\n\nPost-Civil War\nA new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a \"Free State\" in that context [42] Following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen, in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white males.\n\n\n20th century\nThe Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the illiterate from participating These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.\nBlacks defeated three efforts to disenfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns [43] Disenfranchisement bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants [43]\n\n\nGeography\nMaryland has an area of 12,406.68 square miles (32,133.2 km2) and is comparable in overall area with Belgium  [11,787 square miles (30,530 km2)] [49] It is the 42nd-largest and 9th-smallest state and is closest in size to the state of Hawaii  [10,930.98 square miles (28,311.1 km2)], the next smallest state The next largest state is Maryland's neighbor, West Virginia, which is nearly twice the size of Maryland  [24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2)].\n\n\nDescription\nMaryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature [50] It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the Maryland mountains to the west.\n\n\nGeology\nEarthquakes in Maryland are infrequent and small due to the state's distance from seismic/earthquake zones [53] [54] The M5.8 Virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout Maryland Buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily [55] As well as this, notably a M4.8 earthquake from Tewksbury in central New Jersey was felt slightly throughout Maryland [56]\n\n\nFlora\nAs is typical of states on the East Coast, Maryland's plant life is abundant and healthy An adequate volume of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants, including seagrass and various reeds at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic Wye Oak, a huge example of white oak, the state tree, which can grow over 70 feet (21 m) tall.\n\n\nFauna\nThe state harbors a considerable number of white-tailed deer, especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state, and overpopulation can become a problem Mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include black bears, [67] bobcats, [68] foxes, coyotes, [69] raccoons, and otters [67]\n\n\nEnvironment\nMaryland joined with neighboring states during the end of the 20th century to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay The bay's aquatic life and seafood industry have been threatened by development and by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay [76] [77]\n\n\nClimate\nMaryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds.\nThe eastern half of Maryland, which includes Ocean City, Salisbury, Annapolis, and the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with flat topography and sandy or muddy soil This region has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters; it falls under USDA Hardiness zone 8a [65]\n\n\nCities and metro areas\nMost of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the Baltimore metropolitan area and Washington metropolitan area, both of which are part of the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C., and in and around Baltimore, Maryland's most populous city Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the Fall Line, the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and waterfalls Maryland's capital city, Annapolis, is one exception to this pattern since it lies along the banks of the Severn River, close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2020 United States census, the United States Census Bureau found that population of Maryland was 6,185,278 people, a 7.1% increase from the 2010 United States census [95] The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase from the 2010 United States census and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year This includes a natural increase since the last census of 269,166 (464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people into the state Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 129,730 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,017 people [96] In 2018, The top countries of origin for Maryland's immigrants were El Salvador (11%), India (6%), China (5%), Nigeria (5%), and the Philippines (4%) [97] The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated community of Jessup [98]\n\n\nBirth data\nAs of 2011, 58.0 percent of Maryland's population younger than age 1 were minority background [108]\n\n\nLanguage and ancestry\nRacial makeup of Maryland excluding Hispanics from racial categories (2019) [121]\nNH = Non-Hispanic\n\n\nReligion\nMaryland has been historically prominent to American Catholic tradition because the English colony of Maryland was intended by George Calvert as a haven for English Catholics Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S (1789), and Emmitsburg was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be canonized, St Elizabeth Ann Seton Georgetown University, the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland; it became a part of the District of Columbia when it was created in the 1790s The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the Archbishop of Baltimore is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-primate, [citation needed] and often a cardinal Among the immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries from eastern and southern Europe were many Catholics.\n\n\nLGBT population\nMaryland has one of the highest percentages of LGBT people in its populace out of any state; 5.7% of Marylanders identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, the highest of any state (Washington, D.C ranks higher with a LGBT population of 8.6%.) Maryland ranks as one of the best states in the nation for rights of the LGBT community, with protections against discrimination enacted since 2001 for sexuality and 2014 for gender, same-sex marriage legalization in 2013, bans on conversion therapy enacted in 2018, abolition of the gay panic defense in 2021, and issuance in 2023 of an executive order protecting the rights of transgender individuals In 2020, Montgomery County unanimously passed an ordinance implementing an LGBTIQ+ bill of rights.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maryland's gross state product in 2016 was $382.4 billion [161] However, Maryland has been using Genuine Progress Indicator, an indicator of well-being, to guide the state's development, rather than relying only on growth indicators like GDP [162] [163] According to the U.S Census Bureau, Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country, with a 2013 median household income of $72,483, [164] which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are second and third respectively Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the second and eleventh wealthiest counties in the nation respectively Maryland has the most millionaires per capita in 2013, with a ratio of 7.7 percent [165] Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8 percent is the lowest in the country [166] [167] [168] Per capita personal income in 2006 was $43,500, fifth in the nation As of March 2022, the state's unemployment rate was 4.6 percent [169]\n\n\nPort of Baltimore\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the Port of Baltimore and its related rail and trucking access The port ranked 17th in the U.S by tonnage in 2008 [171] Although the port handles a wide variety of products, the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities, such as iron ore, petroleum, sugar, and fertilizers, often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland Midwest via good overland transportation The port also receives several brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number one auto port in the U.S [172]\n\n\nFishing\nMaryland has a large food-production sector A large component of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, striped bass, and menhaden The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges The waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen.\n\n\nAgriculture\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads, plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, melons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles) The southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times, but declined greatly after a state government buy-out in the 1990s There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state Farming suffers from weeds as anywhere else, including an unusual multiply resistant ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) found by Rousonelos et al., 2012 with both ALS- and PPO-resistances [176] and which by 2016 had developed a third, EPSP resistance [177] This ragweed population is a drag on soybean cultivation and, as of May 7, 2022 [update], is the worst multiresistant weed problem in the state [177]\n\n\nBiotechnology\nMaryland is a major center for life sciences research and development With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there, Maryland is the fourth largest nexus in this field in the United States [178]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is popular in Maryland Many tourists visit Baltimore, the beaches of the Eastern Shore, and the nature of western Maryland Attractions in Baltimore include the Harborplace, the Baltimore Aquarium, Fort McHenry, as well as the Camden Yards baseball stadium Ocean City on the Atlantic Coast has been a popular beach destination in summer, particularly since the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952 connecting the Eastern Shore to the more populated Maryland cities [48] The state capital of Annapolis offers sites such as the state capitol building, the historic district, and the waterfront Maryland also has several sites of interest to military history, given Maryland's role in the American Civil War and in the War of 1812 Other attractions include the historic and picturesque towns along the Chesapeake Bay, such as Saint Mary's, Maryland's first colonial settlement and original capital [180]\n\n\nHealthcare\nAs of 2017, the top two health insurers including all types of insurance were CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield with 47% market share followed by UnitedHealth Group at 15% [181]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation oversees most transportation in the state through its various administration-level agencies [183] The independent Maryland Transportation Authority maintains and operates the state's eight toll facilities.\n\n\nRoads\nMaryland's Interstate highways include 110 miles (180 km) of Interstate 95 (I-95), which enters the northeast portion of the state, travels through Baltimore, and becomes part of the eastern section of the Capital Beltway to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge I-68 travels 81 miles (130 km), connecting the western portions of the state to I-70 at the small town of Hancock I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for 93 miles (150 km) to Baltimore, connecting Hagerstown and Frederick along the way.\n\n\nAirports\nMaryland's largest airport is Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, more commonly referred to as BWI The airport is named for the Baltimore-born Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice The only other airports with commercial service are at Hagerstown and Salisbury.\n\n\nRail\nAmtrak trains, including the high-speed Acela Express serve Penn Station in Baltimore, BWI Airport, New Carrollton, and Aberdeen along the Washington, D.C to Boston Northeast Corridor Train service is provided to Rockville and Cumberland by Amtrak's Washington, D.C., to Chicago Capitol Limited.\n\n\nLaw and government\nThe government of Maryland is conducted according to the state constitution The government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\nTaxation\nMaryland imposes five income tax brackets, ranging from 2 to 6.25 percent of personal income [191] The city of Baltimore and Maryland's 23 counties levy local \"piggyback\" income taxes at rates between 1.25 and 3.2 percent of Maryland taxable income Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly The top income tax bracket of 9.45 percent is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country, behind New York City's 11.35 percent, California's 10.3 percent, Rhode Island's 9.9 percent, and Vermont's 9.5 percent [192]\n\n\nElections\nPrior to the American Civil War, Maryland's elections were largely controlled by the Democrats, which account for 54.9% of all registered voters as of May 2017 [195]\n\n\nMedia\nA well-known newspaper in Maryland is The Baltimore Sun [203]\nMany residents of the Washington metropolitan area receive The Washington Post [citation needed]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation Week ranked Maryland #1 in its nationwide 2009–2013 Quality Counts reports [204] Primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education, which is headquartered in Baltimore [205] The highest educational official in the state is the State Superintendent of Schools, who is appointed by the State Board of Education to a four-year term of office The Maryland General Assembly has given the Superintendent and State Board autonomy to make educationally related decisions, limiting its influence on the day-to-day functions of public education Each county and county-equivalent in Maryland has a local Board of Education charged with running the public schools in that particular jurisdiction.\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nEducation Week ranked Maryland #1 in its nationwide 2009–2013 Quality Counts reports [204] Primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen

"Maryland is a state located in the eastern part of the United States, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the east. It is the 42nd-largest and 9th-smallest state in terms of area, with a total area of 12,406.68 square miles (32,133.2 km2). The state is known for its diverse geography, with a mix of sandy dunes, low marshlands, gently rolling hills, and pine groves.\n\n## History\n\nThe history of Maryland dates back to the 17th century, when the English colony of Maryland was established in 1632. The colony was named after Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. The first colonial settlement in Maryland was established at St. Mary's City, which was the state's first capital. The colony was founded by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, who sought to create a haven for English Catholics.\n\n## 17th Century\n\nDuring the 17th century, Maryland was a major tobacco-producing colony, with tobacco being the primary cash crop. The colony also had a significant population of African slaves, who were brought to the colony to work on plantations. In 1681, Charles II granted a charter to William Penn, who established the colony of Pennsylvania. However, the charter included a provision that the southern border of Pennsylvania would be identical to the northern border of Maryland. This led to a problem when the two colonies developed, as the border between them was not clearly defined.\n\n## 18th Century\n\nIn the 18th century, Maryland continued to grow and develop, with the colonization of the western part of the state. The state also became a major hub for trade and commerce, with the Port of Baltimore being established in 1729. During the American Revolution, Maryland remained loyal to the British Crown, but after the war, the state began to take steps towards independence.\n\n## 19th Century\n\nIn the 19th century, Maryland underwent significant changes, including the abolition of slavery in 1864. The state also became a major industrial center, with the development of railroads and factories. During the Civil War, Maryland remained in the Union, but the state was heavily divided, with many residents sympathizing with the Confederacy.\n\n## 20th Century\n\nIn the 20th century, Maryland continued to grow and develop, with the state becoming a major center for industry and technology. The state also became a hub for higher education, with the establishment of several top-ranked universities, including Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland.\n\n## Geography\n\nMaryland's geography is characterized by a mix of sandy dunes, low marshlands, gently rolling hills, and pine groves.

English about \"Maryland\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nWhat is now Maryland was originally inhabited by tribes such as the Piscataway (including the Patuxent), the Nanticoke (including the Tocwogh, the Ozinie and other subdivisions), the Powhatan, the Lenape, the Susquehannock, the Shawnee, the Tutelo, the Saponi, the Pocomoke and the Massawomeck [21] [self-published source?] George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579–1632), sought a charter from King Charles I for the territory between Massachusetts to the north and Virginia to the immediate south [22]\nAfter Baltimore died in April 1632, the charter was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), on June 20, 1632 Officially, the new \"Maryland Colony\" was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I [23] Lord Baltimore initially proposed the name \"Crescentia\", the land of growth or increase, but \"the King proposed Terra Mariae  [Mary Land], which was concluded on and inserted in the bill.\" [15]\n\n\n17th century\nWhat is now Maryland was originally inhabited by tribes such as the Piscataway (including the Patuxent), the Nanticoke (including the Tocwogh, the

the Ozinie and other subdivisions), the Powhatan, the Lenape, the Susquehannock, the Shawnee, the Tutelo, the Saponi, the Pocomoke and the Massawomeck [21] [self-published source?] George Calvert, 1st

Charles I [23] Lord Baltimore initially proposed the name \"Crescentia\", the land of growth or increase, but \"the King proposed Terra Mariae  [Mary Land], which was concluded on and inserted in the bill.\" [15]\n\n\nPersecution of Catholics\nMaryland was founded to provide a haven for England's Roman Catholic minority [27]\nAlthough Maryland was the most heavily Catholic of the English mainland colonies, the religion was still in the minority, consisting of less than 10% of the total population [28]\n\n\nBorder disputes (1681–1760)\nThe royal charter granted Maryland the land north of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, the 40th parallel But the grant indicated that Charles II and William Penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to New Castle, Delaware when it falls north of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681.\n\n\n18th century\nMost of the English colonists arrived in Maryland as indentured servants, and had to serve a several years' term as laborers to pay for their passage [33] In the early years, the line between indentured servants and African slaves or laborers was fluid, and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together, and formed unions Mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children took the social status of their mothers, a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies, following Virginia in 1662.\n\n\n19th century\nInfluenced by a changing economy, revolutionary ideals, and preaching by ministers, numerous planters in Maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the Revolutionary War Across the Upper South the free black population increased from less than 1% before the war to 14% by 1810 [35] Abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass were born slaves during this time in Dorchester County and Talbot County, respectively [36] [37]\n\n\nCivil War\nThe state remained in the Union during the American Civil War, [40] due in significant part to demographics and Federal intervention The 1860 census, held shortly before the outbreak of the civil war, showed that 49% of Maryland's African Americans were free [35]\n\n\nPost-Civil War\nA new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and Maryland was first recognized as a \"Free State\" in that context [42] Following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen, in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white males.\n\n\n20th century\nThe Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \"assisting\" voters; initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the illiterate from participating These measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks Blacks resisted such efforts, with suffrage groups conducting voter education.\nBlacks defeated three efforts to disenfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns [43] Disenfranchisement bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, in large part because of black opposition Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants [43]\n\n\nGeography\nMaryland has an area of 12,406.68 square miles (32,133.2 km2) and is comparable in overall area with Belgium  [11,787 square miles (30,530 km2)] [49] It is the 42nd-largest and 9th-smallest state and is closest in size to the state of Hawaii  [10,930.98 square miles (28,311.1 km2)], the next smallest state The next largest state is Maryland's neighbor, West Virginia, which is nearly twice the size of Maryland  [24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km2)].\n\n\nDescription\nMaryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature [50] It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the Maryland mountains to the west.\n\n\nGeology\nEarthquakes in Maryland are infrequent and small due to the state's distance from seismic/earthquake zones [53] [54] The M5.8 Virginia earthquake in 2011 was felt moderately throughout Maryland Buildings in the state are not well-designed for earthquakes and can suffer damage easily [55] As well as this, notably a M4.8 earthquake from Tewksbury in central New Jersey was felt slightly throughout Maryland [56]\n\n\nFlora\nAs is typical of states on the East Coast, Maryland's plant life is abundant and healthy An adequate volume of annual precipitation helps to support many types of plants, including seagrass and various reeds at the smaller end of the spectrum to the gigantic Wye Oak, a huge example of white oak, the state tree, which can grow over 70 feet (21 m) tall.\n\n\nFauna\nThe state harbors a considerable number of white-tailed deer, especially in the woody and mountainous west of the state, and overpopulation can become a problem Mammals can be found ranging from the mountains in the west to the central areas and include black bears, [67] bobcats, [68] foxes, coyotes, [69] raccoons, and otters [67]\n\n\nEnvironment\nMaryland joined with neighboring states during the end of the 20th century to improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay The bay's aquatic life and seafood industry have been threatened by development and by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay [76] [77]\n\n\nClimate\nMaryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds.\nThe eastern half of Maryland, which includes Ocean City, Salisbury, Annapolis, and the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with flat topography and sandy or muddy soil This region has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters; it falls under USDA Hardiness zone 8a [65]\n\n\nCities and metro areas\nMost of the population of Maryland lives in the central region of the state, in the Baltimore metropolitan area and Washington metropolitan area, both of which are part of the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area The majority of Maryland's population is concentrated in the cities and suburbs surrounding Washington, D.C., and in and around Baltimore, Maryland's most populous city Historically, these and many other Maryland cities developed along the Fall Line, the line along which rivers, brooks, and streams are interrupted by rapids and waterfalls Maryland's capital city, Annapolis, is one exception to this pattern since it lies along the banks of the Severn River, close to where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2020 United States census, the United States Census Bureau found that population of Maryland was 6,185,278 people, a 7.1% increase from the 2010 United States census [95] The United States Census Bureau estimated that the population of Maryland was 6,045,680 on July 1, 2019, a 4.71% increase from the 2010 United States census and an increase of 2,962, from the prior year This includes a natural increase since the last census of 269,166 (464,251 births minus 275,093 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 116,713 people into the state Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 129,730 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,017 people [96] In 2018, The top countries of origin for Maryland's immigrants were El Salvador (11%), India (6%), China (5%), Nigeria (5%), and the Philippines (4%) [97] The center of population of Maryland is located on the county line between Anne Arundel County and Howard County, in the unincorporated community of Jessup [98]\n\n\nBirth data\nAs of 2011, 58.0 percent of Maryland's population younger than age 1 were minority background [108]\n\n\nLanguage and ancestry\nRacial makeup of Maryland excluding Hispanics from racial categories (2019) [121]\nNH = Non-Hispanic\n\n\nReligion\nMaryland has been historically prominent to American Catholic tradition because the English colony of Maryland was intended by George Calvert as a haven for English Catholics Baltimore was the seat of the first Catholic bishop in the U.S (1789), and Emmitsburg was the home and burial place of the first American-born citizen to be canonized, St Elizabeth Ann Seton Georgetown University, the first Catholic University, was founded in 1789 in what was then part of Maryland; it became a part of the District of Columbia when it was created in the 1790s The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Baltimore was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in the United States, and the Archbishop of Baltimore is, albeit without formal primacy, the United States' quasi-primate, [citation needed] and often a cardinal Among the immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries from eastern and southern Europe were many Catholics.\n\n\nLGBT population\nMaryland has one of the highest percentages of LGBT people in its populace out of any state; 5.7% of Marylanders identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, the highest of any state (Washington, D.C ranks higher with a LGBT population of 8.6%.) Maryland ranks as one of the best states in the nation for rights of the LGBT community, with protections against discrimination enacted since 2001 for sexuality and 2014 for gender, same-sex marriage legalization in 2013, bans on conversion therapy enacted in 2018, abolition of the gay panic defense in 2021, and issuance in 2023 of an executive order protecting the rights of transgender individuals In 2020, Montgomery County unanimously passed an ordinance implementing an LGBTIQ+ bill of rights.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Maryland's gross state product in 2016 was $382.4 billion [161] However, Maryland has been using Genuine Progress Indicator, an indicator of well-being, to guide the state's development, rather than relying only on growth indicators like GDP [162] [163] According to the U.S Census Bureau, Maryland households are currently the wealthiest in the country, with a 2013 median household income of $72,483, [164] which puts it ahead of New Jersey and Connecticut, which are second and third respectively Two of Maryland's counties, Howard and Montgomery, are the second and eleventh wealthiest counties in the nation respectively Maryland has the most millionaires per capita in 2013, with a ratio of 7.7 percent [165] Also, the state's poverty rate of 7.8 percent is the lowest in the country [166] [167] [168] Per capita personal income in 2006 was $43,500, fifth in the nation As of March 2022, the state's unemployment rate was 4.6 percent [169]\n\n\nPort of Baltimore\nOne major service activity is transportation, centered on the Port of Baltimore and its related rail and trucking access The port ranked 17th in the U.S by tonnage in 2008 [171] Although the port handles a wide variety of products, the most typical imports are raw materials and bulk commodities, such as iron ore, petroleum, sugar, and fertilizers, often distributed to the relatively close manufacturing centers of the inland Midwest via good overland transportation The port also receives several brands of imported motor vehicles and is the number one auto port in the U.S [172]\n\n\nFishing\nMaryland has a large food-production sector A large component of this is commercial fishing, centered in the Chesapeake Bay, but also including activity off the short Atlantic seacoast The largest catches by species are the blue crab, oysters, striped bass, and menhaden The Bay also has overwintering waterfowl in its wildlife refuges The waterfowl support a tourism sector of sportsmen.\n\n\nAgriculture\nMaryland has large areas of fertile agricultural land in its coastal and Piedmont zones, though this land use is being encroached upon by urbanization Agriculture is oriented to dairy farming (especially in foothill and piedmont areas) for nearby large city milksheads, plus specialty perishable horticulture crops, such as cucumbers, watermelons, sweet corn, tomatoes, melons, squash, and peas (Source:USDA Crop Profiles) The southern counties of the western shoreline of Chesapeake Bay are warm enough to support a tobacco cash crop zone, which has existed since early Colonial times, but declined greatly after a state government buy-out in the 1990s There is also a large automated chicken-farming sector in the state's southeastern part; Salisbury is home to Perdue Farms Maryland's food-processing plants are the most significant type of manufacturing by value in the state Farming suffers from weeds as anywhere else, including an unusual multiply resistant ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) found by Rousonelos et al., 2012 with both ALS- and PPO-resistances [176] and which by 2016 had developed a third, EPSP resistance [177] This ragweed population is a drag on soybean cultivation and, as of May 7, 2022 [update], is the worst multiresistant weed problem in the state [177]\n\n\nBiotechnology\nMaryland is a major center for life sciences research and development With more than 400 biotechnology companies located there, Maryland is the fourth largest nexus in this field in the United States [178]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is popular in Maryland Many tourists visit Baltimore, the beaches of the Eastern Shore, and the nature of western Maryland Attractions in Baltimore include the Harborplace, the Baltimore Aquarium, Fort McHenry, as well as the Camden Yards baseball stadium Ocean City on the Atlantic Coast has been a popular beach destination in summer, particularly since the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was built in 1952 connecting the Eastern Shore to the more populated Maryland cities [48] The state capital of Annapolis offers sites such as the state capitol building, the historic district, and the waterfront Maryland also has several sites of interest to military history, given Maryland's role in the American Civil War and in the War of 1812 Other attractions include the historic and picturesque towns along the Chesapeake Bay, such as Saint Mary's, Maryland's first colonial settlement and original capital [180]\n\n\nHealthcare\nAs of 2017, the top two health insurers including all types of insurance were CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield with 47% market share followed by UnitedHealth Group at 15% [181]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation oversees most transportation in the state through its various administration-level agencies [183] The independent Maryland Transportation Authority maintains and operates the state's eight toll facilities.\n\n\nRoads\nMaryland's Interstate highways include 110 miles (180 km) of Interstate 95 (I-95), which enters the northeast portion of the state, travels through Baltimore, and becomes part of the eastern section of the Capital Beltway to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge I-68 travels 81 miles (130 km), connecting the western portions of the state to I-70 at the small town of Hancock I-70 enters from Pennsylvania north of Hancock and continues east for 93 miles (150 km) to Baltimore, connecting Hagerstown and Frederick along the way.\n\n\nAirports\nMaryland's largest airport is Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, more commonly referred to as BWI The airport is named for the Baltimore-born Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice The only other airports with commercial service are at Hagerstown and Salisbury.\n\n\nRail\nAmtrak trains, including the high-speed Acela Express serve Penn Station in Baltimore, BWI Airport, New Carrollton, and Aberdeen along the Washington, D.C to Boston Northeast Corridor Train service is provided to Rockville and Cumberland by Amtrak's Washington, D.C., to Chicago Capitol Limited.\n\n\nLaw and government\nThe government of Maryland is conducted according to the state constitution The government of Maryland, like the other 49 state governments, has exclusive authority over matters that lie entirely within the state's borders, except as limited by the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\nTaxation\nMaryland imposes five income tax brackets, ranging from 2 to 6.25 percent of personal income [191] The city of Baltimore and Maryland's 23 counties levy local \"piggyback\" income taxes at rates between 1.25 and 3.2 percent of Maryland taxable income Local officials set the rates and the revenue is returned to the local governments quarterly The top income tax bracket of 9.45 percent is the fifth highest combined state and local income tax rates in the country, behind New York City's 11.35 percent, California's 10.3 percent, Rhode Island's 9.9 percent, and Vermont's 9.5 percent [192]\n\n\nElections\nPrior to the American Civil War, Maryland's elections were largely controlled by the Democrats, which account for 54.9% of all registered voters as of May 2017 [195]\n\n\nMedia\nA well-known newspaper in Maryland is The Baltimore Sun [203]\nMany residents of the Washington metropolitan area receive The Washington Post [citation needed]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation Week ranked Maryland #1 in its nationwide 2009–2013 Quality Counts reports [204] Primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen by the Maryland State Department of Education, which is headquartered in Baltimore [205] The highest educational official in the state is the State Superintendent of Schools, who is appointed by the State Board of Education to a four-year term of office The Maryland General Assembly has given the Superintendent and State Board autonomy to make educationally related decisions, limiting its influence on the day-to-day functions of public education Each county and county-equivalent in Maryland has a local Board of Education charged with running the public schools in that particular jurisdiction.\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nEducation Week ranked Maryland #1 in its nationwide 2009–2013 Quality Counts reports [204] Primary and secondary education in Maryland is overseen

animation, prosthetic makeup, puppetry and blue screen, it was always Burton's intention to make the style similar to that of the B movies he grew up with as a child He said that he wanted to make the effects look cheap and purposely fake-looking [23] Burton wanted to hire Anton Furst as production designer after being impressed with his work on The Company of Wolves (1984) and Full Metal Jacket (1987), but Furst was committed to High Spirits, a choice he later regretted [24] He hired Bo Welch, his future collaborator on Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns The test screenings were met with positive feedback and prompted Burton to film an epilogue featuring Betelgeuse foolishly angering a witch doctor [25] Warner Bros disliked the title Beetlejuice and wanted to call the film House Ghosts As a joke, Burton suggested the name Scared Sheetless and was horrified when the studio actually considered using it [26] While the setting is the fictional village of Winter River, Connecticut, all outdoor scenes were filmed in East Corinth, a village in the town of Corinth, Vermont [27] Interiors were filmed at The Culver Studios in Culver City, California Principal photography took place from March 11 to June 11, 1987 [28]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Beetlejuice soundtrack, first released in 1988 on LP, CD, and cassette tape, features most of the film's score, written and arranged by

appear in the film are absent from the soundtrack: \"Man Smart, Woman Smarter\" and \"Sweetheart from Venezuela\" The soundtrack entered the Billboard 200 albums chart the week ending June 25, 1988,

{"title": "Soham_murders", "content": "\nDisappearance\nAt 11:45 a.m on Sunday, 4 August 2002, Jessica Chapman left her home in Brook Street, Soham, for a barbecue at the home of her best friend, Holly Wells, in nearby Redhouse Gardens She told her parents she was going to give her friend a necklace engraved with the letter \"H\" that she had purchased for her on a recent family holiday to Menorca [6] [7]\n\n\nSearch and discovery\nPolice immediately launched an intensive search for the missing children [20] Over 400 officers were assigned full-time to search for the girls [21] These officers conducted extensive house-to-house enquiries across Soham; [22] their efforts to search local terrain were supported by hundreds of local volunteers [23] and, later, some United States Air Force personnel stationed at nearby airbases [24] [n 1]\n\n\nSightings\nSeveral members of the public reported having seen the children in the early days of the investigation Mark Tuck informed investigators that as he had driven past the girls on Sand Street in Soham town centre at approximately 6:30 p.m on 4 August, [43] his attention had been drawn toward their Manchester United replica shirts, causing him to remark to his wife, Lucy: \"Look! There's two little Beckhams over there.\" [44] A young woman named Karen Greenwood also reported seeing the girls walking \"arm in arm\" along College Road approximately two minutes later [8] Another woman living in nearby Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose appearance and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman walking past her home the morning after they had been reported missing [45] Police also received statements regarding a suspicious white van that had been seen in Soham on the evening of the children's disappearance Investigators located and seized this vehicle from a caravan park in Wentworth on 7 August; this lead also proved fruitless [38]\n\n\nDiscoveries\nAt about 12:30 p.m on 17 August, [61] a 48-year-old gamekeeper named Keith Pryer discovered the bodies of both girls lying side by side in a 5-foot (1.5 m) deep irrigation ditch close to a pheasant pen near the perimeter fence of RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, [62] more than 10 miles (16 km) east of Soham [63] Pryer had noticed what he later described as an \"unusual and unpleasant smell\" [64] in the area several days earlier; when returning to the area with two friends on 17 August, he had decided to investigate its cause [65] Walking through an overgrown verge about 600 yards (550 m) from a partially tarmacked road, Pryer and one of his companions, Adrian Lawrence, discovered the children's bodies Lawrence turned to his girlfriend, Helen Sawyer, and shouted: \"Don't come any closer, Helen! Get back in the van!\" [66] Lawrence immediately reported the discoveries to police [67]\n\n\nIdentification\nOn 21 August, both bodies were identified via DNA testing [72] [76] Nine days later, a public memorial service was held at Ely Cathedral for the girls [77] About 2,000 people attended, including the girls' classmates, teachers and the six family liaison officers who had provided 24-hour support for both families [75] The Reverend Tim Alban Jones officiated at this service, saying: \"Would not the best and most lasting memorial to these two lovely young girls be a change for the better in how we behave towards each other? Today's service is a small milestone in our shared journey of grief and sorrow .. it is our hope that we may perhaps draw a line under one phase of our grieving and begin to look forward.\" [78]\n\n\nInquest\nThe inquest into the children's deaths was held at Shire Hall, Cambridge, on 23 August 2002 [10] Coroner David Morris testified the bodies of both girls were partially skeletonised, and that no precise cause of death could be determined for either of them Morris stated that the most likely cause of death of both girls had been asphyxiation [1] He also stated that the girls had almost certainly not died at the location where their bodies had been discovered, [72] and that both bodies had been placed there within 24 hours of their deaths [81] [n 7] These conclusions were physically supported by an analysis of the shoots of nettles at the crime scene which enabled forensic ecologist and palynologist Patricia Wiltshire to estimate that the bodies had been placed at this location almost two weeks before [70]\n\n\nFunerals\nThe funeral services for Wells and Chapman were held on consecutive days in September 2002 Both services were held at St Andrew's parish church and officiated by Tim Alban Jones, and the girls are buried in graves next to each other in Soham's Fordham Road Cemetery, following ceremonies attended by only family and close friends [83] At the request of both families, the media refrained from reporting on either service [84] [85]\n\n\nPolice investigation\nIn the weeks following the disappearances, Huntley reluctantly [86] granted several television interviews to media outlets such as Sky News and the regional BBC News programme, BBC Look East, speaking of the general shock in the local community and his dismay at being the last person to see the children alive [87]\n\n\nSuspicions\nHaving participated in the search for the children, Huntley regularly asked police officers questions such as how their investigation was progressing and how long DNA evidence could survive before deteriorating [23] One of these officers observed three vertical scratches on Huntley's left jaw, each measuring approximately three centimetres (1.2 in), which he claimed had been recently inflicted by his dog [58]\n\n\nArrest\nHaving discovered the children's clothes at Soham Village College, [81] police decided to arrest Huntley and Carr Both were arrested on suspicion of abduction and murder at 4:30 a.m on 17 August [104] Investigators had stated on 7 August they strongly believed the children had been abducted, [38] and announced their strong suspicions that both girls had been murdered on this date [105] [106]\n\n\nCharges\nBy 20 August, investigators had established sufficient physical evidence from Huntley's home, vehicle and Soham Village College to charge him with two counts of murder [79] He was charged with these offences while detained for observation at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire, and all preliminary hearings against him were postponed until the conclusion of his mental health assessment [112] Carr was also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice on this date [113] [n 11] She was further charged with two counts of assisting an offender on 17 January 2003 [22]\n\n\nPre-trial assessments\nTo determine Huntley's state of mental health, he was detained under Section 48 of the Mental Health Act for almost two months at Rampton Secure Hospital Here, his mental state was assessed by Christopher Clark, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, to determine whether he suffered from any form of mental illness and whether he was mentally competent to stand trial Clark concluded in October that, although psychopathic, [119] Huntley did not suffer from any major mental or psychotic illness [120] [121] On 8 October, Huntley was deemed mentally competent to stand trial [121]\n\n\nTrial\nThe trial of Huntley for the murders of Wells and Chapman opened at the Old Bailey on 5 November 2003 before Mr Justice Alan Moses; Huntley was charged with two counts of murder, to which he entered a plea of not guilty Carr was charged with two counts of assisting an offender and one count of perverting the course of justice [81]\n\n\nConvictions\nThe jury deliberated for four days before reaching their verdicts against both defendants [151] On 17 December 2003, they returned a majority verdict of guilty on two counts of murder against Huntley He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of imprisonment to be imposed by the Lord Chief Justice at a later date [16] Huntley's face showed no emotion as the verdict was announced; the mothers of both Wells and Chapman burst into tears [150] [152]\n\n\nSentencing\nOn 29 September 2005 High Court judge Mr Justice Moses announced that Huntley must remain in prison until he had served a minimum of 40 years' imprisonment, a term which would not allow parole eligibility until 2042, by which time he would be 68 years old [155] In setting this minimum term of imprisonment, Mr Justice Moses stated: \"The order I make offers little or no hope of the defendant's eventual release.\" [156]\n\n\nCriminal profiles\nIan Kevin Huntley was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on 31 January 1974, the first of two sons born to Kevin Huntley and his wife, Lynda (née Nixon) [158] The Huntley family were working class and at the time of the birth of their first child, lodged with Lynda's parents in Grimsby Following the birth of their second child, Wayne, in August 1975, the family moved into a rented property in Immingham, where Huntley attended school [159]\n\n\nIan Huntley\nIan Kevin Huntley was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on 31 January 1974, the first of two sons born to Kevin Huntley and his wife, Lynda (née Nixon) [158] The Huntley family were working class and at the time of the birth of their first child, lodged with Lynda's parents in Grimsby Following the birth of their second child, Wayne, in August 1975, the family moved into a rented property in Immingham, where Huntley attended school [159]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn June 1994, Huntley began dating 18-year-old Claire Evans, who he met through his employment at a local Heinz factory After two months of courtship, [162] Huntley proposed to Evans The couple married at Grimsby Register Office on 28 January 1995 [162] The marriage was short-lived due to Huntley's volatile temper, which surfaced within days of their marriage Within a month, Huntley had begun to regularly sexually assault his wife, also subjecting her to indignities such as locking her in their house and cutting off her hair On one occasion, he beat his wife so badly she suffered a miscarriage [167]\n\n\nPrevious offences\nIn March 1996, Huntley was charged with burglary In this offence, he and an accomplice allegedly broke into the house of a neighbour in Grimsby and stole electrical goods, jewellery and cash The case reached court, but the prosecution offered no evidence, resulting in a judge ordering the offence to lie on file [169]\n\n\nMotive\nHuntley's motive for killing the children is unknown; minutes prior to encountering Wells and Chapman, he is known to have had an argument with Carr, ending in his slamming the phone down [68] Huntley had allegedly suspected Carr of conducting affairs throughout their relationship, leading his mother and some police officers to suspect he had killed the two girls in a fit of jealous rage [68] However, prior to his trial, a criminal profile had resulted in his being ruled by an eminent criminal psychologist as a \"latent, predatory paedophile\" [174] who had lured Wells and Chapman into his home in a moment of opportunism [14]\n\n\nMaxine Carr\nMaxine Carr was born Maxine Ann Capp She was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on 16 February 1977, the second of two daughters born to Alfred Capp and his wife, Shirley (née Suddaby) [188]\n\n\nRelationship\nIn February 1999, Huntley met 22-year-old Maxine Carr in a Grimsby nightclub On this occasion, Carr had been drinking with a former boyfriend named Paul Selby when Huntley – a casual acquaintance of Selby – approached the two and initiated a conversation [198] According to Carr, she was \"instantly attracted\" to Huntley's self-confident and pleasant persona, and agreed to begin dating him that same evening [162] Within four weeks of their acquaintance, [199] she had moved into Huntley's Barton-upon-Humber flat, and the couple informed relatives of their eagerness to start a family [200] Shortly thereafter, the couple moved to a ground-floor flat in Scunthorpe, where Huntley formally proposed to Carr in June 1999 [201]\n\n\nAftermath\nAn orange-petalled rose, dedicated to the memory of Wells and Chapman, was unveiled by representatives of Soham Town Council at the 2003 Chelsea Flower Show The inspiration for dedicating a flower to the children's memory came from a poem read aloud at the memorial service at Ely Cathedral on 30 August 2002 by the father of Wells, titled Soham's Rose [213]\n\n\nInquiry\nImmediately after Huntley's conviction, previous criminal allegations against him were made public These disclosures revealed that not only had police failed to pursue numerous previous criminal complaints of sexual offences against underage girls and young women by Huntley, but he had then secured a job in Soham allowing him access to children [235]\n\n\nRecommendations\nThe Bichard inquiry recommended a mandatory registration scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults such as the elderly and mentally handicapped [241] This recommendation later led to the foundation of the Independent Safeguarding Authority The findings also suggested a national system should be implemented for police forces to share intelligence information, and that all police forces should follow a clear code of practice on record-keeping These findings ultimately led to the tightening of various procedures within the Criminal Records Bureau system, including compulsory checks into potential criminal backgrounds of people who apply to work with children [242]\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited works and further reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Soham_murders\" following this outline:\n\n\nDisappearance\nAt 11:45 a.m on Sunday, 4 August 2002, Jessica Chapman left her home in Brook Street, Soham, for a barbecue at the home of her best friend, Holly Wells, in nearby Redhouse Gardens She told her parents she was going to give her friend a necklace engraved with the letter \"H\" that she had purchased for her on a recent family holiday to Menorca [6] [7]\n\n\nSearch and discovery\nPolice immediately launched an intensive search for the missing children [20] Over 400 officers were assigned full-time to search for the girls [21] These officers conducted extensive house-to-house enquiries across Soham;

grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices and describing the 875-won ($0.65) price of a green onion he found as reasonable, only for it to emerge that the onions were being sold at a discount and that the true price of onions was three to four times higher The incident led to opposition candidates bringing out green onions at campaign rallies and the hashtag #greenonions875won becoming a trending topic on social media throughout the election In response, the National Election Commission banned voters from bringing green onions to polling stations, citing concerns over \"election interference\" This was in turn, widely ridiculed and led to an increase in demand for green onion-themed merchandise [12]\n\n\nPolitical parties\nBy 14 February 2024, a total of 16 current members of

The day marks the end of British colonial rule and the beginning of a new era of freedom and self-governance for the Indian people. The celebrations on this day are a testament to the nation's commitment to its independence and its people's struggle for freedom.\n\n**History**\n\nEuropean traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the late 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885.\n\nThe period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n**Independence Day before Independence**\n\nHasrat Mohani was the first person in Indian History who demanded 'Complete Independence' (Azadi-e-Kaamil), at the 1929 session of the Indian National Congress. The Purna Swaraj declaration, or \"Declaration of the Independence of India\", was promulgated, and 26 January was declared as Independence Day in 1930. The Congress called on people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and \"to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time\" until India attained complete independence.\n\nCelebration of such an Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence. The Congress observed 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1946. The celebration was marked by meetings where the attendants took the \"pledge of independence\". Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such meetings were peaceful, solemn, and \"without any speeches or exhortation\".\n\nGandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, the day would be spent \"in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or service of 'untouchables', or reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these together\". Following actual independence in 1947, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from 26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day.\n\n**Immediate Background**\n\nIn 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support nor the reliability of native forces for continuing to maintain control in an increasingly restless India. On 20 February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest.\n\n**Partition and Independence**\n\nMillions of Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding independence. In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people on both sides of the new borders died in the violence. While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an attempt to stem the carnage.\n\nOn 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi.\n\n**Celebration**\n\nThe celebrations of Independence Day in India are a grand affair, with flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural events, and patriotic songs. The day begins with the swearing-in of the governor general and ministers at Government House at 8:30 am. A procession of ministers to the Constituent Assembly follows, with a state drive to the Constituent Assembly at 9:50 am. A royal salute to the governor general is given at 9:55 am, followed by the hoisting of the national flag at the Constituent Assembly at 10:30 am.\n\nA state drive to Government House follows, with a flag ceremony at India Gate at 6:00 pm. Illuminations and fireworks displays are a part of the celebrations, with an official dinner at Government House at 8:45 pm. A reception at Government House marks the end of the celebrations.\n\n**Security Threats**\n\nAs early as three years after independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in northeast India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations.\n\nWith increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags, and by flag burning. Terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen, and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nOn Independence Day and Republic Day, patriotic songs in regional languages are broadcast on television and radio channels. They are also played alongside flag-hoisting ceremonies.

since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day.\n\n\nImmediate background\nIn 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, realised that it had neither the mandate at home, the international support nor the reliability of native forces for continuing to maintain control in an increasingly restless India [1]: 203  [15] [16] [17] On 20 February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee announced that the British government would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest [18]\n\n\nPartition and independence\nMillions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding independence [21] In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 people on both sides of the new borders died in the violence [22] While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an attempt to stem the carnage [23] On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi.\n\n\nCelebration\n08.30 am Swearing in of governor general and ministers at Government House09.40 am Procession of ministers to Constituent Assembly09.50 am State drive to Constituent Assembly09.55 am Royal salute to governor general10.30 am Hoisting of national flag at Constituent Assembly10.35 am State drive to Government House06.00 pm Flag ceremony at India Gate07.00 pm Illuminations07.45 pm Fireworks display08.45 pm Official dinner at Government House10.15 pm Reception at Government office.\n\n\nSecurity threats\nAs early as three years after independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in northeast India [42] Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations [43] With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, [44] separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning [45] [46] [47] Terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day [48] Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations [49] [50]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nOn Independence Day and Republic Day, patriotic songs in regional languages are broadcast on television and radio channels [58] They are also played alongside flag-hoisting ceremonies [58] Patriotic films are broadcast [31] Over the decades, according to The Times of India, the number of such films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with patriotic films [59] The population belonging to Generation Y often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and garments that represent India's various cultural traditions [36] [60] Shops often offer Independence Day sales promotions [61] [62] Some news reports have decried the commercialism [61] [63] [64] Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August [65]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Moore, Matt Wolpert, and Ben Nedivi. The show is set in an alternate history where the Soviet Union landed on the Moon before the United States, and follows the lives of astronauts and their families as they navigate the challenges of space exploration. The series premiered on Apple TV+ in 2019 and has since received critical acclaim for its unique take on history and its well-developed characters.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe series is set in an alternate timeline in 1969, where Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov becomes the first human to land on the Moon. This outcome devastates morale at NASA, but also catalyzes a U.S. effort to catch up. The Soviet Union's emphasis on diversity, including the inclusion of a woman in subsequent landings, forces the United States to match pace, training women and minorities who were largely excluded from the initial decades of U.S. space exploration. Each subsequent season takes place 10 years later, with season two taking place in the 1980s, season three taking place in the 1990s, and season four taking place in the 2000s.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe main cast includes Joel Kinnaman, Michael Dorman, Sarah Jones, Shantel VanSanten, and Wrenn Schmidt.

The band's music style is a fusion of different genres, including nu metal, alternative metal, and heavy metal. Slipknot is known for their energetic live performances, elaborate stage sets, and attention-grabbing image.\n\n# History\n## Background (1991–1995)\nIn the years before Slipknot formed, a state of shifting band membership existed throughout the heavy metal scene in Des Moines, Iowa. In 1991, the biggest heavy metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with Jim Root on guitar. Drummer Joey Jordison founded a thrash metal band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist Craig Jones.\n\n## Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. and beginnings (1995–1998)\nMuch of the band's early development was retrospectively attributed to late-night planning sessions between Gray, Crahan, and Jordison at a Sinclair gas station where Jordison worked nights. It was there, in late 1995, that Jordison suggested changing the band name to Slipknot after their song of the same name. In December, Slipknot began recording material at SR Audio, a studio in the band's hometown. As they didn't have a recording contract, the band self-financed the project, the costs of which came to an estimated $40,000. In February 1996, guitarist Donnie Steele, a Christian, left Slipknot after discussions regarding the band's lyrics with the producer, Sean McMahon.\n\n## Slipknot and rise to fame (1998–2000)\nChris Fehn was brought in to replace Darner on percussion before Slipknot traveled to Malibu, California, to work on their debut album in September 1998. Partway through the recording process of the album, Slipknot returned to Des Moines for the Christmas period. During that period, guitarist Brainard decided to leave the band. Slipknot later recruited Jim Root to complete their lineup, and the band returned to Malibu to continue work on the album. Work on the album concluded in early 1999, allowing the band to go on their first tour as part of the Ozzfest lineup in 1999. Ozzfest greatly increased Slipknot's audience, furthering the band's success with their self-titled album that was released on June 29, 1999.\n\n# Iowa (2001–2003)\nAnticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001, and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album—released on August 28, 2001—peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK.\n\n# Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) (2003–2007)\nIt was the rebirth of Slipknot, [...] it was like us coming back together, pushing out the vibe that had gotten in there and kinda started pulling people away. But we figured out that you know, we do have to get space, you know, we do need to let people be sometimes.\n\n# All Hope Is Gone and Gray's death (2008–2010)\nPreparation for Slipknot's fourth album began towards the end of 2007; work began at Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa, with producer Dave Fortman in February 2008. The album was finished in June, and the band went on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour on July 9, 2008. Slipknot's fourth album, All Hope Is Gone, was released on August 20, 2008, debuting at number one on the Billboard albums chart.\n\n# Return to the stage, Antennas to Hell and Knotfest (2011–2012)\nIf this tour doesn't work, this band might be over—straight up. And I'm not gonna lie; I'm not the guy that's going to lie to the fans.\n\n# .5: The Gray Chapter and new members (2013–2016)\nProduction of the band's fifth album began in late 2013. Taylor described the album as \"very dark\" and a cross between Iowa and Vol 3 (The Subliminal Verses). Guitarist Jim Root did not participate in Stone Sour's January tour so he could write material for Slipknot.\n\n# We Are Not Your Kind and Fehn's departure (2017–2020)\nSlipknot singer Corey Taylor regrouped with his other band Stone Sour in 2017, and they released their album Hydrograd on June 30. Talking about his first work in cinema and the other Slipknot members' plans, in an interview with WRIF's Meltdown, Crahan revealed that \"we're beginning to write some music for Slipknot for the new record. We have songs that we've written that are amazing.\"\n\n# The End, So Far and Jones' and Weinberg's departures (2021–2023)\nOn May 19, 2021, Shawn Crahan revealed that the band had been currently making \"god music.\" In an article published by Loudwire on June 9, 2021, Shawn Crahan revealed that a new Slipknot album would 'hopefully' be released in 2021. He also added that the band would be parting ways with Roadrunner Records following the release of the album.\n\n# 25th anniversary touring and Casagrande's joining (2024–present)\nIn April 2024, Slipknot began teasing events for the 25th anniversary of their debut album. In the metadata for the promotional material, fans found the names \"Jeff\" and \"Eloy,\" leading to speculation that the new sampler and drummer are ex-Dirty Little Rabbits bassist Jeff Karnowski and former Sepultura drummer Eloy Casagrande, respectively. Casagrande's identity would be confirmed shortly afterwards, when he debuted as the band's drummer at a warm-up show at Pappy & Harriet's Palace, California.\n\n# Artistry\nSlipknot is most often considered a nu metal and alternative metal band, or heavy metal in general. They have included elements of groove metal, death metal, hard rock, grindcore, thrash metal, metalcore, and rap metal in their music. The album All Hope Is Gone is considered a groove metal album with elements of death metal and thrash metal.\n\n# Lyrics\nSlipknot's lyrics are generally very aggressive, and sometimes include profanity while exploring themes such as darkness, nihilism, anger, disaffection, love, misanthropy, and psychosis.

number of verses The Quranic text also describes the settlement of his followers in Yathrib after their expulsion by the Quraysh, and briefly mentions military encounters such as the Muslim victory at Badr [17]\n\n\nEarly biographies\nImportant sources regarding Muhammad's life may be found in the historic works by writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Hijri era (mostly overlapping with the 8th and 9th centuries CE respectively) [22] These include traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which provide additional information about his life [23]\n\n\nHadith\nOther important sources include the hadith collections, accounts of verbal and physical teachings and traditions attributed to Muhammad Hadiths were compiled several generations after his death by Muslims including Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi, Abd ar-Rahman al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Malik ibn Anas, al-Daraqutni [32] [33]\n\n\nMeccan years\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim [38] was born in Mecca [39] c. 570, [1] and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal [40] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, which was a dominant force in western Arabia [41] While his clan was one of the more distinguished in the tribe, it seems to have experienced a lack of prosperity during his early years [11] [d]\nAccording

the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, which was a dominant force in western Arabia [41] While his clan was one of the more distinguished in the tribe, it seems to have experienced a lack of prosperity during his early years [11] [d]\nAccording to Muslim tradition, Muhammad was a hanif, someone who professed monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia He is also claimed to have been a descendant of Ishmael, son of Abraham [42] [citation not found] [43]\n\n\nBeginnings of the Quran\nThe financial security Muhammad enjoyed from Khadija, his wealthy wife, gave him plenty of free time to spend in solitude in the cave of Hira [73] [74] According to Islamic tradition, in 610, when he was 40 years old, the angel Gabriel appeared to him during his visit to the cave The angel showed him a cloth with Quranic verses on it and instructed him to read When Muhammad confessed his illiteracy, Gabriel choked him forcefully, nearly suffocating him, and repeated the command As Muhammad reiterated his inability to read, Gabriel choked him again in a similar manner This sequence took place once more before Gabriel finally recited the verses, allowing Muhammad to memorize them [75] [76] [77] These verses later constituted Quran 96:1-5 [78]\n\n\nOpposition in Mecca\nAround 613, Muhammad began to preach to the public; [8] [97] many of his first followers were women, freedmen, servants, slaves, and other members of the lower social class [96] These converts keenly awaited each new revelation from Muhammad; when he recited it, they all would repeat after him and memorize it, and the literate ones recorded it in writing [98] [better source needed]  Muhammad also introduced rituals to his group which included prayer (salat) with physical postures that embodied complete surrender (islam) to God, and almsgiving (zakat) as a requirement of the Muslim community (ummah) [99] By this point, Muhammad's religious movement was known as tazakka ('purification') [100] [101]\n\n\nQuraysh delegation to Yathrib\nThe leaders of the Quraysh sent Nadr ibn al-Harith and Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt to Yathrib to seek the opinions of the Jewish rabbis regarding Muhammad The rabbis advised them to ask Muhammad three questions: recount the tale of young men who ventured forth in the first age; narrate the story of a traveler who reached both the eastern and western ends of the earth; and provide details about the spirit If Muhammad answered correctly, they stated, he would be a Prophet; otherwise, he would be a liar When they returned to Mecca and asked Muhammad the questions, he told them he would provide the answers the next day However, 15 days passed without a response from his God, leading to gossip among the Meccans and causing Muhammad distress At some point later, the angel Gabriel came to Muhammad and provided him with the answers [118] [119]\n\n\nMigration to Abyssinia and the incident of Satanic Verses\nIn 615, Muhammad sent some of his followers to emigrate to the Abyssinian Kingdom of Aksum and found a small colony under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar [11] Among those who departed were Umm Habiba, the daughter of one of the Quraysh chiefs, Abu Sufyan, and her husband [126] The Quraysh then sent two men to retrieve them Because leatherwork at the time was highly prized in Abyssinia, they gathered a lot of skins and transported them there so they could distribute some to each of the kingdom's generals But the king firmly rejected their request [127]\n\n\nAttempt to establish himself in Ta'if\nIn 619, Muhammad faced a period of sorrow His wife, Khadija, a crucial source of his financial and emotional support, died [137] In the same year, his uncle and guardian, Abu Talib, also died [138] [139] Despite Muhammad's persuasions to Abu Talib to embrace Islam on his deathbed, he clung to his polytheistic beliefs until the end [140] [139] Muhammad's other uncle, Abu Lahab, who succeeded the Banu Hashim clan leadership, was initially willing to provide Muhammad with protection However, upon hearing from Muhammad that Abu Talib and Abd al-Muttalib were destined for hell due to not believing in Islam, he withdrew his support [140] [141]\n\n\nIsra' and Mi'raj\nIt is at this low point in Muhammad's life that the accounts in the Sīrah lay out the famous Isra' and Mi'raj Nowadays, Isra' is believed by Muslims to be the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem, while Mi'raj is from Jerusalem to the heavens [151] There is considered no substantial basis for the Mi'raj in the Quran, as the Quran does not address it directly [152]\n\n\nMigration to Medina\nAs resistance to his proselytism in Mecca grew, Muhammad began to limit his efforts to non-Meccans who attended fairs or made pilgrimages [154] During this period, Muhammad had an encounter with six individuals from the Banu Khazraj These men had a history of raiding Jews in their locality, who in turn would warn them that a prophet would be sent to punish them On hearing Muhammad's religious message, they said to each other, \"This is the very prophet of whom the Jews warned us Don't let them get to him before us!\" Upon embracing Islam, they returned to Medina and shared their encounter, hoping that by having their people—the Khazraj and the Aws, who had been at odds for so long—accept Islam and adopt Muhammad as their leader, unity could be achieved between them [155] [156]\n\n\nMedinan years\nA few days after settling in Medina, Muhammad negotiated for the purchase of a piece of land; upon this plot, the Muslims began constructing a building that would become Muhammad's residence as well as a community gathering place (masjid) for prayer (salat) Tree trunks were used as pillars to hold up the roof, and there was no fancy pulpit; instead, Muhammad stood on top of a small stool to speak to the congregation The structure was completed after about seven months in April 623, becoming the first Muslim building and mosque; its northern wall had a stone marking the direction of prayer (qibla) which was Jerusalem at that time Muhammad used the building to host public and political meetings, as well as a place for the poor to gather to receive alms, food, and care Christians and Jews were also allowed to participate in community worship at the mosque Initially, Muhammad's religion had no organized way to call the community to prayer in a coordinated manner To resolve this, Muhammad had considered using a ram's horn (shofar) like the Jews or a wooden clapper like the Christians, but one of the Muslims in the community had a dream where a man in a green cloak told him that someone with a loud booming voice should announce the service by crying out \"allahu akbar\" ('God is greater') to remind Muslims of their top priority; when Muhammad heard about this dream, he agreed with the idea and selected Bilal, a former Abyssinian slave known for his loud voice [170]\n\n\nBuilding the religious community in Medina\nA few days after settling in Medina, Muhammad negotiated for the purchase of a piece of land; upon this plot, the Muslims began constructing a building that would become

Muhammad heard about this dream, he agreed with the idea and selected Bilal, a former Abyssinian slave known for his loud voice [170]\n\n\nConstitution of Medina\nThe Constitution of Medina was a legal covenant written by Muhammad In the constitution, Medina's Arab and Jewish tribes promised to live peacefully alongside the Muslims and to refrain from making a separate treaty with Mecca It also guaranteed the Jews freedom of religion In the agreement, everyone under its jurisdiction was required to defend and protect the oasis if attacked Politically, the agreement helped Muhammad better understand which people were on his side [171] Ibn Ishaq, following his narration of the Hijrah, maintains that Muhammad penned the text and divulges its assumed content without supplying any isnad or corroboration [172] The appellation is generally deemed imprecise, as the text neither established a state nor enacted Quranic statutes, [173] but rather addressed tribal matters [174] While scholars from both the West and the Muslim world agree on the text's authenticity, disagreements persist on whether it was a treaty or a unilateral proclamation by Muhammad, the number of documents it comprised, the primary parties, the specific timing of its creation (or that of its constituent parts), whether it was drafted before or after Muhammad's removal of the three leading Jewish tribes of Medina, and the proper approach to translating it [172] [175]\n\n\nBeginning of armed conflict\nFollowing the emigration, the people of Mecca seized property of Muslim emigrants to Medina [176] War would later break out between the people of Mecca and the Muslims Muhammad delivered Quranic verses permitting Muslims to fight the Meccans [177] According to the traditional account, on 11 February 624, while praying in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn in Medina, Muhammad received revelations from God that he should be facing Mecca rather than Jerusalem during prayer Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer [178]\n\n\nConflicts with Jewish tribes\nOnce the ransom arrangements for the Meccan captives were finalized, he initiated a siege on the Banu Qaynuqa, [193] regarded as the weakest and wealthiest of Medina's three main Jewish tribes [194] [195] Muslim sources provide different reasons for the siege, including an altercation involving Hamza and Ali in the Banu Qaynuqa market, and another version by Ibn Ishaq, which tells the story of a Muslim woman being pranked by a Qaynuqa goldsmith [195] [196] Regardless of the cause, the Banu Qaynuqa sought refuge in their fort, where Muhammad blockaded them, cutting off their access to food supplies The Banu Qaynuqa requested help from their Arab allies, but the Arabs refused since they were supporters of Muhammad [197] After roughly two weeks, the Banu Qaynuqa capitulated without engaging in combat [194] [195]\n\n\nMeccan retaliation\nIn 625, the Quraysh, wearied by Muhammad's continuous attacks on their caravans, decided to take decisive action Led by Abu Sufyan, they assembled an army to oppose Muhammad [193] [202] Upon being alerted by his scout about the impending threat, Muhammad convened a war council Initially, he considered defending from the city center, but later decided to meet the enemy in open battle at Mount Uhud, following the insistence of the younger faction of his followers [203] As they prepared to depart, the remaining Jewish allies of Abdullah ibn Ubayy offered their help, which Muhammad declined [204] Despite being outnumbered, the Muslims initially held their ground but lost advantage when some archers disobeyed orders As rumors of Muhammad's death spread, the Muslims started to flee, but he had only been injured and managed to escape with a group of loyal adherents Satisfied they had restored their honor, the Meccans returned to Mecca [193] [205] Mass casualties suffered by the Muslims in the Battle of Uhud resulted in many wives and daughters being left without a male protector, so after the battle, Muhammad received revelation allowing Muslim men to have up to four wives each, marking the beginning of polygyny in Islam [206]\n\n\nRaid on the Banu Mustaliq\nUpon receiving a report that the Banu Mustaliq were planning an attack on Medina, Muhammad's troops executed a surprise attack on them at their watering place, causing them to flee rapidly In the confrontation, the Muslims lost one man, while the enemy suffered ten casualties [217] As part of their triumph, the Muslims seized 2,000 camels, 500 sheep and goats, and 200 women from the tribe [218] The Muslim soldiers desired the captive women, but they also sought ransom money They asked Muhammad about using coitus interruptus to prevent pregnancy, to which Muhammad replied, \"You are not under any obligation to forbear from that...\" [219] [220] Later, envoys arrived in Medina to negotiate the ransom for the women and children Despite having the choice, all of them chose to return to their country instead of staying [219] [220]\n\n\nBattle of the Trench\nWith the help of the exiled Banu Nadir, the Quraysh military leader Abu Sufyan mustered a force of 10,000 men Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time; the Muslims dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman the Persian The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted two weeks [221] Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to return home [j] The Quran discusses this battle in sura Al-Ahzab, in verses 33:9–27 [222]\nDuring the battle, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, located to the south of Medina, entered into negotiations with Meccan forces to revolt against Muhammad Although the Meccan forces were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him No agreement was reached after prolonged negotiations, partly due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad's scouts [223] After the coalition's retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to Ibn Ishaq, all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved [224] [225] Walid N Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq's narrative [226] Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq's Jewish sources, speaking over 100 years after the event, conflated this account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary Malik ibn Anas, and a transmitter of \"odd tales\" by the later Ibn Hajar [227] Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved [228] [229] Watt finds Arafat's arguments \"not entirely convincing\", while Meir J Kister has contradicted [clarification needed] the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad [230]\n\n\nInvasion of the Banu Qurayza\nOn the day the Quraysh forces and their allies withdrew, Muhammad, while bathing at his wife's abode, received a visit from the angel Gabriel, who instructed him to attack the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza [233] [234] [235] Islamic sources recount that during the preceding Meccan siege, the Quraysh leader Abu Sufyan incited the Qurayza to attack the Muslims from their compound, but the Qurayza demanded the Quraysh to provide 70 hostages from among themselves to ascertain their commitment to their plans, as proposed by Muhammad's secret agent Nuaym ibn Masud Abu Sufyan refused their requirement [236] Nevertheless, later accounts claim that 11 Jewish individuals from the Qurayza were indeed agitated and acted against Muhammad, though the course of event may have been dramatized within the tradition [237] [234]\n\n\nIncidents with the Banu Fazara\nA few months after the conflict with the Banu Qurayza, Muhammad organized a caravan to conduct trade in Syria Zayd ibn Haritha was tasked with guarding the convoy When they journeyed through the territory of Banu Fazara, whom Zayd had raided in the past, the tribe seized the opportunity for revenge, attacking the caravan and injuring him Upon his return to Medina, Muhammad ordered Zayd to lead a punitive operation against the Fazara in which their matriarch Umm Qirfa was captured and brutally executed [251] [252]\n\n\nTreaty of Hudaybiyya\nEarly in 628, following a dream of making an unopposed pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad embarked on the journey He was dressed in his customary pilgrim attire and was accompanied by a group of followers [254] Upon reaching Hudaybiyya, they encountered Quraysh emissaries who questioned their intentions Muhammad explained they had come to venerate the Kaaba, not to fight [255] He then sent Uthman, Abu Sufyan's second cousin, to negotiate with the Quraysh As the negotiations were prolonged, rumors of Uthman's death began to spark, prompting Muhammad to call his followers to renew their oaths of loyalty Uthman returned with news of a negotiation impasse Muhammad remained persistent In the end, the Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr, an envoy with full negotiation powers Following lengthy discussions, a treaty was finally enacted, [256] with terms:\n\n\nInvasion of Khaybar\nRoughly ten weeks subsequent to his return from Hudaybiyya, Muhammad expressed his plan to invade Khaybar, a flourishing oasis about 75 miles (121 km) north of Medina The city was populated by Jews, including those from the Banu Nadir, who had previously been expelled by Muhammad from Medina With the prospect of rich spoils from the mission, numerous volunteers answered his call [257] [258] To keep their movements hidden, the Muslim military chose to march during the nighttime As dawn arrived and the city folks stepped out of their fortifications to harvest their dates, they were taken aback by the sight of the advancing Muslim forces Muhammad cried out, \"Allahu Akbar! Khaybar is destroyed For when we approach a people's land, a terrible morning awaits the warned ones.\" [259] After a strenuous battle lasting more than a month, the Muslims successfully captured the city [260]\n\n\nFinal years\nThe truce of Hudaybiyyah was enforced for two years The tribe of Banu Khuza'ah had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'ah, killing a few of them The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null [274] [275]\n\n\nConquest of Mecca\nThe truce of Hudaybiyyah was enforced for two years The tribe of Banu Khuza'ah had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'ah, killing a few of them The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null [274] [275]\n\n\nSubduing the Hawazin and Thaqif and the expedition to Tabuk\nUpon learning that Mecca had fallen to the Muslims, the Banu Hawazin gathered their entire tribe, including their families, to fight They are estimated to have around 4,000 warriors [283] [284] Muhammad led 12,000 soldiers to raid them, but they surprised him at the valley of Hunayn [285] The Muslims overpowered them and took their women, children and animals [286] Muhammad then turned his attention to Taif, a city that was famous for its vineyards and gardens He ordered them to be destroyed and besieged the city, which was surrounded by walls After 15–20 days of failing to breach their defenses, he abandoned the attempts [287] [288]\n\n\nFarewell pilgrimage\nOn February 631, Muhammad received a revelation granting idolaters four months of grace, after which the Muslims would attack, kill, and plunder them wherever they met [304] [305]\n\n\nDeath\nAfter praying at the burial site in June 632, Muhammad suffered a dreadful headache that made him cry in pain [309] He continued to spend the night with each of his wives one by one, [310] but he fainted in Maymunah's hut [311] He requested his wives to allow him to stay in Aisha's hut He could not walk there without leaning on Ali and Fadl ibn Abbas, as his legs were trembling His wives and his uncle al-Abbas fed him an Abyssinian remedy when he was unconscious [312] When he came to, he inquired about it, and they explained they were afraid he had pleurisy He replied that God would not afflict him with such a vile disease, and ordered all the women to also take the remedy [313] According to various sources, including Sahih al-Bukhari, Muhammad said that he felt his aorta being severed because of the food he ate at Khaybar [314] [273] On 8 June 632, Muhammad died In his last moments, he reportedly uttered:\n\n\nTomb\nMuhammad was buried where he died in Aisha's house [11] [319] [320] During the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I, the Prophet's Mosque was expanded to include the site of Muhammad's tomb [321] The Green Dome above the tomb was built by the Mamluk sultan Al Mansur Qalawun in the 13th century, although the green color was added in the 16th century, under the reign of Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent [322] Among tombs adjacent to that of Muhammad are those of his companions (Sahabah), the first two Muslim caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar, and an empty one that Muslims believe awaits Jesus [320] [323] [324]\n\n\nSuccession\nWith Muhammad's death, disagreement broke out over who his successor would be [12] [13] Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, Muhammad's friend and collaborator With additional support, Abu Bakr was confirmed as the first caliph This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir Khumm Abu Bakr immediately moved to strike against the forces of the Byzantine Empire because of the previous defeat, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an event that Muslim historians later referred to as the Ridda wars, or \"Wars of Apostasy\" [l]\n\n\nHousehold\nMuhammad's life is traditionally defined into two periods: pre-hijra in Mecca (570–622), and post-hijra in Medina (622–632) Muhammad is said to have had thirteen wives in total (although two have ambiguous accounts, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, as wife or concubine [m] [333]).\n\n\nLegacy\nFollowing the attestation to the oneness of God, the belief in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith Every Muslim proclaims in the Shahada: \"I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God\" The Shahada is the basic creed or tenet of Islam Islamic belief is that ideally the Shahada is the first words a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer (adhan) and the prayer itself Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed [346]\n\n\nIslamic tradition\nFollowing the attestation to the oneness of God, the belief in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith Every Muslim proclaims in the Shahada: \"I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God\" The Shahada is the basic creed or tenet of Islam Islamic belief is

prayer itself Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed [346]\n\n\nAppearance and depictions\nVarious sources present a probable description of Muhammad in the prime of his life He was slightly above average in height, with a sturdy frame and wide chest His neck was long, bearing a large head with a broad forehead His eyes were described as dark and intense, accentuated by long, dark eyelashes His hair, black and not entirely curly, hung over his ears His long, dense beard stood out against his neatly trimmed mustache His nose was long and aquiline, ending in a fine point His teeth were well-spaced His face was described as intelligent, and his clear skin had a line of hair from his neck to his navel Despite a slight stoop, his stride was brisk and purposeful [356] Muhammad's lip and cheek were ripped by a slingstone during the Battle of Uhud [357] [358] The wound was later cauterized, leaving a scar on his face [359]\n\n\nIslamic social reforms\nAccording to W Montgomery Watt, religion for Muhammad was not a private and individual matter but \"the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself He was responding  [not only].. to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation but also to the economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject.\" [373] Bernard Lewis says there are two important political traditions in Islam—Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and Muhammad as a rebel in Mecca In his view, Islam is a great change, akin to a revolution, when introduced to new societies [374]\n\n\nEuropean appreciation\nGuillaume Postel was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad when he argued that Muhammad should be esteemed by Christians as a valid prophet [11] [379] Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because \"he did not deviate from the natural religion\" [11] Henri de Boulainvilliers, in his Vie de Mahomed which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker [11] He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the Romans and Persians, and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain [380] Voltaire had a mixed opinion on Muhammad: in his play Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in an essay in 1748 he calls him \"a sublime and hearty charlatan\" But in Voltaire's historical survey Essai sur les mœurs, he presents Mohammed as a legislator and conqueror and calls him an \"enthusiast\" [380] Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his Social Contract (1762), \"brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers\" [380] In Emmanuel Pastoret's 1787 Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad, he presents the lives of these three \"great men\", \"the greatest legislators of the universe\", and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers Pastoret rejects the common view that Muhammad is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers \"the most sublime truths of cult and morals\"; it defines the unity of God with an \"admirable concision\" Pastoret writes that the common accusations of his immorality are unfounded: on the contrary, his law enjoins sobriety, generosity, and compassion on his followers: the \"legislator of Arabia\" was \"a great man\" [380] Napoleon Bonaparte admired Muhammad and Islam, [381] and described him as a model lawmaker and conqueror [382] Thomas Carlyle in his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History 1841 describes \"Mahomet\" as \"A silent great soul; he was one of those who cannot but be in earnest\" [383] Carlyle's interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars as a demonstration that Western scholarship validates Muhammad's status as a great man in history [384]\n\n\nCriticism\nCriticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when Muhammad was decried by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, and by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for his perceived appropriation of Biblical narratives and figures and proclamation of himself as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" [392] [393] [394] [395] In the Middle Ages, Western and Byzantine Christians labeled him a false prophet, the Antichrist, or portrayed him as a heretic as he was frequently portrayed in Christendom [396] [394] [397] [395] Contemporary criticism involves questioning Muhammad's legitimacy as a prophet, his moral conduct, marriages, ownership of slaves, treatment of enemies, approach to doctrinal matters, and psychological well-being [396] [398] [399] [400]\n\n\nSufism\nThe Sunnah contributed much to the development of Islamic law, particularly from the end of the first Islamic century [401] Muslim mystics, known as Sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet but also as a perfect human being All Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad [402] Some notable Sufis, such as Yusuf Abu al-Haggag, are directly descended from Muhammad [403]\n\n\nOther religions\nFollowers of the Baháʼí Faith venerate Muhammad as one of a number of prophets or \"Manifestations of God\" He is thought to be the final manifestation, or seal of the Adamic cycle, but consider his teachings to have been superseded by those of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí faith, and the first manifestation of the current cycle [404] [405]\n\n\nSee

founder of Islam and the last prophet of God according to Islamic belief. He was born in Mecca, a city in the Arabian Peninsula, and is believed to have received revelations from God through the angel Gabriel. These revelations, which were later compiled into the Quran, form the basis of the Islamic faith. Muhammad's teachings and legacy have had a profound impact on world history, shaping the development of Islamic civilization and influencing millions of people around the world.\n\n**Biographical Sources**\n\nThe Quran is the central religious text of Islam, and Muslims believe it represents the words of God revealed by the archangel Gabriel to Muhammad. The Quran is mainly addressed to a single \"Messenger of God\" who is referred to as Muhammad in a number of verses. The Quranic text also describes the settlement of his followers in Yathrib after their expulsion by the Quraysh, and briefly mentions military encounters such as the Muslim victory at Badr.\n\n**Early Biographies**\n\nImportant sources regarding Muhammad's life may be found in the historic works by writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Hijri era (mostly overlapping with the 8th and 9th centuries CE respectively). These include traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which provide additional information about his life.\n\n**Hadith**\n\nOther important sources include the hadith collections, accounts of verbal and physical teachings and traditions attributed to Muhammad. Hadiths were compiled several generations after his death by Muslims including Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi, Abd ar-Rahman al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Malik ibn Anas, and al-Daraqutni.\n\n**Meccan Years**\n\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim was born in Mecca c. 570 CE. His birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, which was a dominant force in western Arabia. While his clan was one of the more distinguished in the tribe, it seems to have experienced a lack of prosperity during his early years.\n\n**Migration to Abyssinia and the Incident of the Satanic Verses**\n\nIn 615, Muhammad sent some of his followers to emigrate to the Abyssinian Kingdom of Aksum and found a small colony under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Among those who departed were Umm Habiba, the daughter of one of the Quraysh chiefs, Abu Sufyan, and her husband. The Quraysh then sent two men to retrieve them. As the emigrants were waiting for the Quraysh to arrive, Muhammad delivered Quranic verses that some of his followers believed were actually Satanic verses, urging them to adopt the polytheistic practices of the Meccans. However, Gabriel later appeared to Muhammad and revealed that the verses were indeed Satanic and were to be rejected.\n\n**Migration to Medina**\n\nIn 619, Muhammad faced a period of sorrow. His wife, Khadija, died, and his uncle and guardian, Abu Talib, also died. Despite Muhammad's persuasions to Abu Talib to embrace Islam on his deathbed, he clung to his polytheistic beliefs until the end. Muhammad's other uncle, Abu Lahab, who succeeded the Banu Hashim clan leadership, was initially willing to provide Muhammad with protection. However, upon hearing from Muhammad that Abu Talib and Abd al-Muttalib were destined for hell due to not believing in Islam, he withdrew his support.\n\n**Isra' and Mi'raj**\n\nIt is at this low point in Muhammad's life that the accounts in the Sīrah lay out the famous Isra' and Mi'raj. Nowadays, Isra' is believed by Muslims to be the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem, while Mi'raj is from Jerusalem to the heavens. There is considered no substantial basis for the Mi'raj in the Quran, as the Quran does not address it directly.\n\n**Conflicts with Jewish Tribes**\n\nOnce the ransom arrangements for the Meccan captives were finalized, Muhammad initiated a siege on the Banu Qaynuqa, a Jewish tribe that had been living in Medina. The Banu Qaynuqa were regarded as the weakest and wealthiest of Medina's three main Jewish tribes. Muslim sources provide different reasons for the siege, including an altercation involving Hamza and Ali in the Banu Qaynuqa market, and another version by Ibn Ishaq, which tells the story of a Muslim woman being pranked by a Qaynuqa goldsmith. Regardless of the cause, the Banu Qaynuqa sought refuge in their fort, where Muhammad blockaded them, cutting off their access to food supplies.\n\n**Treaty of Hudaybiyya**\n\nEarly in 628, following a dream of making an unopposed pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad embarked on the journey. He was dressed in his customary pilgrim attire and was accompanied by a group of followers. Upon reaching Hudaybiyya, they encountered Quraysh emissaries who questioned their intentions. Muhammad explained they had come to venerate the Kaaba, not to fight. He then sent Uthman, Abu Sufyan's second cousin, to negotiate with the Quraysh. As the negotiations were prolonged, rumors of Uthman's death began to spark, prompting Muhammad to call his followers to renew their oaths of loyalty. Uthman returned with news of a negotiation impasse. Muhammad remained persistent. In the end, the Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr, an envoy with full negotiation powers. Following lengthy discussions, a treaty was finally enacted, with terms that included a ten-year truce between the Muslims and the Quraysh.\n\n**Conquest of Mecca**\n\nIn 630, Muhammad led a large army to Mecca and conquered the city without a fight. The city surrendered to him without resistance, and the people of Mecca were spared. Muhammad ordered the destruction of the idols in the Kaaba and established Islam as the dominant faith in the city.\n\n**Final Years**\n\nAfter the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad turned his attention to the surrounding tribes and cities, conquering several of them and spreading Islam to the surrounding regions. In 632, Muhammad received a revelation from God that allowed him to perform a final pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the Farewell Pilgrimage. On his way back to Medina, Muhammad fell ill and died on June 8, 632.\n\n**Succession**\n\nWith Muhammad's death, disagreement broke out over who his successor would be. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, Muhammad's friend and collaborator. With additional support, Abu Bakr was confirmed as the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir Khumm.\n\n**Appearance and Depictions**\n\nVarious sources present a probable description of Muhammad in the prime of his life.

His face was described as intelligent, and his clear skin had a line of hair from his neck to his navel. Despite a slight stoop, his stride was brisk and purposeful.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMuhammad's teachings and legacy have had a profound impact on world history, shaping the development of Islamic civilization and influencing millions of people around the world. He is revered as a prophet and a messenger of God by millions of Muslims around the world. His teachings emphasize the importance of monotheism, justice, compassion, and morality, and have inspired countless works of art, literature, and architecture throughout history.\n\nIn conclusion, Muhammad was a complex and multifaceted figure who played a pivotal role in shaping the course of human history.

military encounters such as the Muslim victory at Badr [17]\n\n\nEarly biographies\nImportant sources regarding Muhammad's life may be found in the historic works by writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Hijri era (mostly overlapping with the 8th and 9th centuries CE respectively) [22] These include traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which provide additional information about his life [23]\n\n\nHadith\nOther important sources include the hadith collections, accounts of verbal and physical teachings and traditions attributed to Muhammad Hadiths were compiled several generations after his death by Muslims including Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi, Abd ar-Rahman al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Malik ibn Anas, al-Daraqutni [32] [33]\n\n\nMeccan years\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim [38] was born in Mecca [39] c. 570, [1] and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-Awwal [40] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, which was a dominant force in western Arabia [41] While his clan was one of the more distinguished in the tribe, it seems to have experienced a lack of prosperity during his early years [11] [d]\nAccording to Muslim tradition, Muhammad was a hanif, someone who professed monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia He is also claimed to have been a

pre-Islamic Arabia He is also claimed to have been a descendant of Ishmael, son of Abraham [42] [citation not found] [43]\n\n\nBeginnings of the Quran\nThe financial security Muhammad enjoyed from Khadija, his wealthy wife, gave him plenty of free time to spend in solitude in the cave of Hira [73] [74] According to Islamic tradition, in 610, when he was 40 years old, the angel Gabriel appeared to him during his visit to the cave The angel showed him a cloth with Quranic verses on it and instructed him to read When Muhammad confessed his illiteracy, Gabriel choked him forcefully, nearly suffocating him, and repeated the command As Muhammad reiterated his inability to read, Gabriel choked him again in a similar manner This sequence took place once more before Gabriel finally recited the verses, allowing Muhammad to memorize them [75] [76] [77] These verses later constituted Quran 96:1-5 [78]\n\n\nOpposition in Mecca\nAround 613, Muhammad began to preach to the public; [8] [97] many of his first followers were women, freedmen, servants, slaves, and other members of the lower social class [96] These converts keenly awaited each new revelation from Muhammad; when he recited it, they all would repeat after him and memorize it, and the literate ones recorded it in writing [98] [better source needed]  Muhammad also introduced rituals to his group which included prayer (salat) with physical postures that embodied complete surrender (islam) to God, and almsgiving (zakat) as a requirement of the Muslim community (ummah) [99] By this point, Muhammad's religious movement was known as tazakka ('purification') [100] [101]\n\n\nQuraysh delegation to Yathrib\nThe leaders of the Quraysh sent Nadr ibn al-Harith and Uqba ibn Abi Mu'ayt to Yathrib to seek the opinions of the Jewish rabbis regarding Muhammad The rabbis advised them to ask Muhammad three questions: recount the tale of young men who ventured forth in the first age; narrate the story of a traveler who reached both the eastern and western ends of the earth; and provide details about the spirit If Muhammad answered correctly, they stated, he would be a Prophet; otherwise, he would be a liar When they returned to Mecca and asked Muhammad the questions, he told them he would provide the answers the next day However, 15 days passed without a response from his God, leading to gossip among the Meccans and causing Muhammad distress At some point later, the angel Gabriel came to Muhammad and provided him with the answers [118] [119]\n\n\nMigration to Abyssinia and the incident of Satanic Verses\nIn 615, Muhammad sent some of his followers to emigrate to the Abyssinian Kingdom of Aksum and found a small colony under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar [11] Among those who departed were Umm Habiba, the daughter of one of the Quraysh chiefs, Abu Sufyan, and her husband [126] The Quraysh then sent two men to retrieve them Because leatherwork at the time was highly prized in Abyssinia, they gathered a lot of skins and transported them there so they could distribute some to each of the kingdom's generals But the king firmly rejected their request [127]\n\n\nAttempt to establish himself in Ta'if\nIn 619, Muhammad faced a period of sorrow His wife, Khadija, a crucial source of his financial and emotional support, died [137] In the same year, his uncle and guardian, Abu Talib, also died [138] [139] Despite Muhammad's persuasions to Abu Talib to embrace Islam on his deathbed, he clung to his polytheistic beliefs until the end [140] [139] Muhammad's other uncle, Abu Lahab, who succeeded the Banu Hashim clan leadership, was initially willing to provide Muhammad with protection However, upon hearing from Muhammad that Abu Talib and Abd al-Muttalib were destined for hell due to not believing in Islam, he withdrew his support [140] [141]\n\n\nIsra' and Mi'raj\nIt is at this low point in Muhammad's life that the accounts in the Sīrah lay out the famous Isra' and Mi'raj Nowadays, Isra' is believed by Muslims to be the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem, while Mi'raj is from Jerusalem to the heavens [151] There is considered no substantial basis for the Mi'raj in the Quran, as the Quran does not address it directly [152]\n\n\nMigration to Medina\nAs resistance to his proselytism in Mecca grew, Muhammad began to limit his efforts to non-Meccans who attended fairs or made pilgrimages [154] During this period, Muhammad had an encounter with six individuals from the Banu Khazraj These men had a history of raiding Jews in their locality, who in turn would warn them that a prophet would be sent to punish them On hearing Muhammad's religious message, they said to each other, \"This is the very prophet of whom the Jews warned us Don't let them get to him before us!\" Upon embracing Islam, they returned to Medina and shared their encounter, hoping that by having their people—the Khazraj and the Aws, who had been at odds for so long—accept Islam and adopt Muhammad as their leader, unity could be achieved between them [155] [156]\n\n\nMedinan years\nA few days after settling in Medina, Muhammad negotiated for the purchase of a piece of land; upon this plot, the Muslims began constructing a building that would become Muhammad's residence as well as a community gathering place (masjid) for prayer (salat) Tree trunks were used as pillars to hold up the roof, and there was no fancy pulpit; instead, Muhammad stood on top of a small stool to speak to the congregation The structure was completed after about seven months in April 623, becoming the first Muslim building and mosque; its northern wall had a stone marking the direction of prayer (qibla) which was Jerusalem at that time Muhammad used the building to host public and political meetings, as well as a place for the poor to gather to receive alms, food, and care Christians and Jews were also allowed to participate in community worship at the mosque Initially, Muhammad's religion had no organized way to call the community to prayer in a coordinated manner To resolve this, Muhammad had considered using a ram's horn (shofar) like the Jews or a wooden clapper like the Christians, but one of the Muslims in the community had a dream where a man in a green cloak told him that someone with a loud booming voice should announce the service by crying out \"allahu akbar\" ('God is greater') to remind Muslims of their top priority; when Muhammad heard about this dream, he agreed with the idea and selected Bilal, a former Abyssinian slave known for his loud voice [170]\n\n\nBuilding the religious community in Medina\nA few days after settling in Medina, Muhammad negotiated for the purchase of a piece of land; upon this plot, the Muslims began constructing a building that would become Muhammad's residence as well as a community gathering place (masjid) for prayer (salat) Tree trunks were used as pillars to hold up the roof, and there was no fancy pulpit; instead, Muhammad stood on top of a small stool to speak to the congregation The structure was completed after about seven months in April 623,

akbar\" ('God is greater') to remind Muslims of their top priority; when Muhammad heard about this dream, he agreed with the idea and selected Bilal, a former Abyssinian slave known for his loud voice [170]\n\n\nConstitution of Medina\nThe Constitution of Medina was a legal covenant written by Muhammad In the constitution, Medina's Arab and Jewish tribes promised to live peacefully alongside the Muslims and to refrain from making a separate treaty with Mecca It also guaranteed the Jews freedom of religion In the agreement, everyone under its jurisdiction was required to defend and protect the oasis if attacked Politically, the agreement helped Muhammad better understand which people were on his side [171] Ibn Ishaq, following his narration of the Hijrah, maintains that Muhammad penned the text and divulges its assumed content without supplying any isnad or corroboration [172] The appellation is generally deemed imprecise, as the text neither established a state nor enacted Quranic statutes, [173] but rather addressed tribal matters [174] While scholars from both the West and the Muslim world agree on the text's authenticity, disagreements persist on whether it was a treaty or a unilateral proclamation by Muhammad, the number of documents it comprised, the primary parties, the specific timing of its creation (or that of its constituent parts), whether it was drafted before or after Muhammad's removal of the three leading Jewish tribes of Medina, and the proper approach to translating it [172] [175]\n\n\nBeginning of armed conflict\nFollowing the emigration, the people of Mecca seized property of Muslim emigrants to Medina [176] War would later break out between the people of Mecca and the Muslims Muhammad delivered Quranic verses permitting Muslims to fight the Meccans [177] According to the traditional account, on 11 February 624, while praying in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn in Medina, Muhammad received revelations from God that he should be facing Mecca rather than Jerusalem during prayer Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer [178]\n\n\nConflicts with Jewish tribes\nOnce the ransom arrangements for the Meccan captives were finalized, he initiated a siege on the Banu Qaynuqa, [193] regarded as the weakest and wealthiest of Medina's three main Jewish tribes [194] [195] Muslim sources provide different reasons for the siege, including an altercation involving Hamza and Ali in the Banu Qaynuqa market, and another version by Ibn Ishaq, which tells the story of a Muslim woman being pranked by a Qaynuqa goldsmith [195] [196] Regardless of the cause, the Banu Qaynuqa sought refuge in their fort, where Muhammad blockaded them, cutting off their access to food supplies The Banu Qaynuqa requested help from their Arab allies, but the Arabs refused since they were supporters of Muhammad [197] After roughly two weeks, the Banu Qaynuqa capitulated without engaging in combat [194] [195]\n\n\nMeccan retaliation\nIn 625, the Quraysh, wearied by Muhammad's continuous attacks on their caravans, decided to take decisive action Led by Abu Sufyan, they assembled an army to oppose Muhammad [193] [202] Upon being alerted by his scout about the impending threat, Muhammad convened a war council Initially, he considered defending from the city center, but later decided to meet the enemy in open battle at Mount Uhud, following the insistence of the younger faction of his followers [203] As they prepared to depart, the remaining Jewish allies of Abdullah ibn Ubayy offered their help, which Muhammad declined [204] Despite being outnumbered, the Muslims initially held their ground but lost advantage when some archers disobeyed orders As rumors of Muhammad's death spread, the Muslims started to flee, but he had only been injured and managed to escape with a group of loyal adherents Satisfied they had restored their honor, the Meccans returned to Mecca [193] [205] Mass casualties suffered by the Muslims in the Battle of Uhud resulted in many wives and daughters being left without a male protector, so after the battle, Muhammad received revelation allowing Muslim men to have up to four wives each, marking the beginning of polygyny in Islam [206]\n\n\nRaid on the Banu Mustaliq\nUpon receiving a report that the Banu Mustaliq were planning an attack on Medina, Muhammad's troops executed a surprise attack on them at their watering place, causing them to flee rapidly In the confrontation, the Muslims lost one man, while the enemy suffered ten casualties [217] As part of their triumph, the Muslims seized 2,000 camels, 500 sheep and goats, and 200 women from the tribe [218] The Muslim soldiers desired the captive women, but they also sought ransom money They asked Muhammad about using coitus interruptus to prevent pregnancy, to which Muhammad replied, \"You are not under any obligation to forbear from that...\" [219] [220] Later, envoys arrived in Medina to negotiate the ransom for the women and children Despite having the choice, all of them chose to return to their country instead of staying [219] [220]\n\n\nBattle of the Trench\nWith the help of the exiled Banu Nadir, the Quraysh military leader Abu Sufyan mustered a force of 10,000 men Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time; the Muslims dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman the Persian The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted two weeks [221] Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to return home [j] The Quran discusses this battle in sura Al-Ahzab, in verses 33:9–27 [222]\nDuring the battle, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, located to the south of Medina, entered into negotiations with Meccan forces to revolt against Muhammad Although the Meccan forces were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him No agreement was reached after prolonged negotiations, partly due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad's scouts [223] After the coalition's retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to Ibn Ishaq, all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved [224] [225] Walid N Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq's narrative [226] Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq's Jewish sources, speaking over 100 years after the event, conflated this account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary Malik ibn Anas, and a transmitter of \"odd tales\" by the later Ibn Hajar [227] Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved [228] [229] Watt finds Arafat's arguments \"not entirely convincing\", while Meir J Kister has contradicted [clarification needed] the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad [230]\n\n\nInvasion of the Banu Qurayza\nOn the day the Quraysh forces and their allies withdrew, Muhammad, while bathing at his wife's abode, received a visit from the angel Gabriel, who instructed him to attack the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza [233] [234] [235] Islamic sources recount that during the preceding Meccan siege, the Quraysh leader Abu Sufyan incited the Qurayza to attack the Muslims from their compound, but the Qurayza demanded the Quraysh to provide 70 hostages from among themselves to ascertain their commitment to their plans, as proposed by Muhammad's secret agent Nuaym ibn Masud Abu Sufyan refused their requirement [236] Nevertheless, later accounts claim that 11 Jewish individuals from the Qurayza were indeed agitated and acted against Muhammad, though the course of event may have been dramatized within the tradition [237] [234]\n\n\nIncidents with the Banu Fazara\nA few months after the conflict with the Banu Qurayza, Muhammad organized a caravan to conduct trade in Syria Zayd ibn Haritha was tasked with guarding the convoy When they journeyed through the territory of Banu Fazara, whom Zayd had raided in the past, the tribe seized the opportunity for revenge, attacking the caravan and injuring him Upon his return to Medina, Muhammad ordered Zayd to lead a punitive operation against the Fazara in which their matriarch Umm Qirfa was captured and brutally executed [251] [252]\n\n\nTreaty of Hudaybiyya\nEarly in 628, following a dream of making an unopposed pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad embarked on the journey He was dressed in his customary pilgrim attire and was accompanied by a group of followers [254] Upon reaching Hudaybiyya, they encountered Quraysh emissaries who questioned their intentions Muhammad explained they had come to venerate the Kaaba, not to fight [255] He then sent Uthman, Abu Sufyan's second cousin, to negotiate with the Quraysh As the negotiations were prolonged, rumors of Uthman's death began to spark, prompting Muhammad to call his followers to renew their oaths of loyalty Uthman returned with news of a negotiation impasse Muhammad remained persistent In the end, the Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr, an envoy with full negotiation powers Following lengthy discussions, a treaty was finally enacted, [256] with terms:\n\n\nInvasion of Khaybar\nRoughly ten weeks subsequent to his return from Hudaybiyya, Muhammad expressed his plan to invade Khaybar, a flourishing oasis about 75 miles (121 km) north of Medina The city was populated by Jews, including those from the Banu Nadir, who had previously been expelled by Muhammad from Medina With the prospect of rich spoils from the mission, numerous volunteers answered his call [257] [258] To keep their movements hidden, the Muslim military chose to march during the nighttime As dawn arrived and the city folks stepped out of their fortifications to harvest their dates, they were taken aback by the sight of the advancing Muslim forces Muhammad cried out, \"Allahu Akbar! Khaybar is destroyed For when we approach a people's land, a terrible morning awaits the warned ones.\" [259] After a strenuous battle lasting more than a month, the Muslims successfully captured the city [260]\n\n\nFinal years\nThe truce of Hudaybiyyah was enforced for two years The tribe of Banu Khuza'ah had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'ah, killing a few of them The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null [274] [275]\n\n\nConquest of Mecca\nThe truce of Hudaybiyyah was enforced for two years The tribe of Banu Khuza'ah had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'ah, killing a few of them The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null [274] [275]\n\n\nSubduing the Hawazin and Thaqif and the expedition to Tabuk\nUpon learning that Mecca had fallen to the Muslims, the Banu Hawazin gathered their entire tribe, including their families, to fight They are estimated to have around 4,000 warriors [283] [284] Muhammad led 12,000 soldiers to raid them, but they surprised him at the valley of Hunayn [285] The Muslims overpowered them and took their women, children and animals [286] Muhammad then turned his attention to Taif, a city that was famous for its vineyards and gardens He ordered them to be destroyed and besieged the city, which was surrounded by walls After 15–20 days of failing to breach their defenses, he abandoned the attempts [287] [288]\n\n\nFarewell pilgrimage\nOn February 631, Muhammad received a revelation granting idolaters four months of grace, after which the Muslims would attack, kill, and plunder them wherever they met [304] [305]\n\n\nDeath\nAfter praying at the burial site in June 632, Muhammad suffered a dreadful headache that made him cry in pain [309] He continued to spend the night with each of his wives one by one, [310] but he fainted in Maymunah's hut [311] He requested his wives to allow him to stay in Aisha's hut He could not walk there without leaning on Ali and Fadl ibn Abbas, as his legs were trembling His wives and his uncle al-Abbas fed him an Abyssinian remedy when he was unconscious [312] When he came to, he inquired about it, and they explained they were afraid he had pleurisy He replied that God would not afflict him with such a vile disease, and ordered all the women to also take the remedy [313] According to various sources, including Sahih al-Bukhari, Muhammad said that he felt his aorta being severed because of the food he ate at Khaybar [314] [273] On 8 June 632, Muhammad died In his last moments, he reportedly uttered:\n\n\nTomb\nMuhammad was buried where he died in Aisha's house [11] [319] [320] During the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I, the Prophet's Mosque was expanded to include the site of Muhammad's tomb [321] The Green Dome above the tomb was built by the Mamluk sultan Al Mansur Qalawun in the 13th century, although the green color was added in the 16th century, under the reign of Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent [322] Among tombs adjacent to that of Muhammad are those of his companions (Sahabah), the first two Muslim caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar, and an empty one that Muslims believe awaits Jesus [320] [323] [324]\n\n\nSuccession\nWith Muhammad's death, disagreement broke out over who his successor would be [12] [13] Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, Muhammad's friend and collaborator With additional support, Abu Bakr was confirmed as the first caliph This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir Khumm Abu Bakr immediately moved to strike against the forces of the Byzantine Empire because of the previous defeat, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an event that Muslim historians later referred to as the Ridda wars, or \"Wars of Apostasy\" [l]\n\n\nHousehold\nMuhammad's life is traditionally defined into two periods: pre-hijra in Mecca (570–622), and post-hijra in Medina (622–632) Muhammad is said to have had thirteen wives in total (although two have ambiguous accounts, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, as wife or concubine [m] [333]).\n\n\nLegacy\nFollowing the attestation to the oneness of God, the belief in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith Every Muslim proclaims in the Shahada: \"I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God\" The Shahada is the basic creed or tenet of Islam Islamic belief is that ideally the Shahada is the first words a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer (adhan) and the prayer itself Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed [346]\n\n\nIslamic tradition\nFollowing the attestation to the oneness of God, the belief in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith

prayer itself Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed [346]\n\n\nAppearance and depictions\nVarious sources present a probable description of Muhammad in the prime of his life He was slightly above average in height, with a sturdy frame and wide chest His neck was long, bearing a large head with a broad forehead His eyes were described as dark and intense, accentuated by long, dark eyelashes His hair, black and not entirely curly, hung over his ears His long, dense beard stood out against his neatly trimmed mustache His nose was long and aquiline, ending in a fine point His teeth were well-spaced His face was described as intelligent, and his clear skin had a line of hair from his neck to his navel Despite a slight stoop, his stride was brisk and purposeful [356] Muhammad's lip and cheek were ripped by a slingstone during the Battle of Uhud [357] [358] The wound was later cauterized, leaving a scar on his face [359]\n\n\nIslamic social reforms\nAccording to W Montgomery Watt, religion for Muhammad was not a private and individual matter but \"the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself He was responding  [not only].. to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation but also to the economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject.\" [373] Bernard Lewis says there are two important political traditions in Islam—Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and Muhammad as a rebel in Mecca In his view, Islam is a great change, akin to a revolution, when introduced to new societies [374]\n\n\nEuropean appreciation\nGuillaume Postel was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad when he argued that Muhammad should be esteemed by Christians as a valid prophet [11] [379] Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because \"he did not deviate from the natural religion\" [11] Henri de Boulainvilliers, in his Vie de Mahomed which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker [11] He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the Romans and Persians, and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain [380] Voltaire had a mixed opinion on Muhammad: in his play Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in an essay in 1748 he calls him \"a sublime and hearty charlatan\" But in Voltaire's historical survey Essai sur les mœurs, he presents Mohammed as a legislator and conqueror and calls him an \"enthusiast\" [380] Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his Social Contract (1762), \"brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers\" [380] In Emmanuel Pastoret's 1787 Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad, he presents the lives of these three \"great men\", \"the greatest legislators of the universe\", and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers Pastoret rejects the common view that Muhammad is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers \"the most sublime truths of cult and morals\"; it defines the unity of God with an \"admirable concision\" Pastoret writes that the common accusations of his immorality are unfounded: on the contrary, his law enjoins sobriety, generosity, and compassion on his followers: the \"legislator of Arabia\" was \"a great man\" [380] Napoleon Bonaparte admired Muhammad and Islam, [381] and described him as a model lawmaker and conqueror [382] Thomas Carlyle in his book On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History 1841 describes \"Mahomet\" as \"A silent great soul; he was one of those who cannot but be in earnest\" [383] Carlyle's interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars as a demonstration that Western scholarship validates Muhammad's status as a great man in history [384]\n\n\nCriticism\nCriticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when Muhammad was decried by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, and by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for his perceived appropriation of Biblical narratives and figures and proclamation of himself as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" [392] [393] [394] [395] In the Middle Ages, Western and Byzantine Christians labeled him a false prophet, the Antichrist, or portrayed him as a heretic as he was frequently portrayed in Christendom [396] [394] [397] [395] Contemporary criticism involves questioning Muhammad's legitimacy as a prophet, his moral conduct, marriages, ownership of slaves, treatment of enemies, approach to doctrinal matters, and psychological well-being [396] [398] [399] [400]\n\n\nSufism\nThe Sunnah contributed much to the development of Islamic law, particularly from the end of the first Islamic century [401] Muslim mystics, known as Sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet but also as a

III Will Look Like\" [14]\n\n\nMilitary plans\nMilitary strategists have used war games to prepare for various war scenarios and to determine the most appropriate strategies War games were utilized for World War I and World War II [15]\n\n\nOperation Unthinkable\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was concerned that, with the enormous size of Soviet Red Army forces deployed in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of World War II and the unreliability of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, there was a serious threat to Western Europe In April–May 1945, the British Armed Forces developed Operation Unthinkable, thought to be the first scenario of the Third World War [16] Its primary goal was \"to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire\" [17] The plan was rejected by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible.\n\n\nOperation Dropshot\nOperation Dropshot was the 1950s United States contingency plan for a possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union in the Western European and Asian theaters Although the scenario made use of nuclear weapons, they were not expected to play a decisive role.\n\n\nBritish-Irish cooperation\nThe Republic of Ireland started planning for a possible nuclear war in the late 1940s Co-operation between the United Kingdom and Ireland would be formed in the event of WWIII, where they would share weather data, control aids to navigation, and coordinate the Wartime Broadcasting Service that would occur after a nuclear attack [18] Operation Sandstone in Ireland was a top-secret British-Irish military operation [18] The armed forces from both states began a coastal survey of Britain and Ireland cooperating from 1948 to 1955 This was a request from the United States to identify suitable landing grounds for the US in the event of a successful Soviet invasion [18] [19] By 1953, the co-operation agreed upon sharing information on wartime weather and the evacuation of civilian refugees from Britain to Ireland [18] Ireland's Operation Sandstone ended in 1966 [19]\n\n\nExercises Grand Slam, Longstep, and Mainbrace\nIn January 1950, the North Atlantic Council approved NATO's military strategy of containment [20] NATO military planning took on a renewed urgency following the outbreak of the Korean War in the early 1950s, prompting NATO to establish a \"force under a centralized command, adequate to deter aggression and to ensure the defense of Western Europe\" Allied Command Europe was established under General of the Army Dwight D Eisenhower, US Army, on 2 April 1951 [21] [22] The Western Union Defence Organization had previously carried out Exercise Verity, a 1949 multilateral exercise involving naval air strikes and submarine attacks.\n\n\nExercise Strikeback\nExercise Strikeback was a major NATO naval exercise held in 1957, simulating a response to an all-out Soviet attack on NATO The exercise involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the United States Navy, the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, the French Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Navy As the largest peacetime naval operation up to that time, Exercise Strikeback was characterized by military analyst Hanson W Baldwin of The New York Times as \"constituting the strongest striking fleet assembled since World War II\" [25]\n\n\nExercise Reforger\nExercise Reforger (from the REturn of FORces to GERmany) was an annual exercise conducted during the Cold War by NATO While US troops could be easily flown across the Atlantic, the heavy equipment and armor reinforcements would have to come by sea and be delivered to POMCUS (Pre-positioned Overseas Material Configured to Unit Sets) sites [26] These exercises tested the United States and allied abilities to carry out transcontinental reinforcement [26] Timely reinforcement was a critical part of the NATO reinforcement exercises The United States needed to be able to send active-duty army divisions to Europe within ten days as part of a wartime NATO general deployment [26] In addition to assessing the capabilities of the United States, Reforger also monitored the personnel, facilities, and equipment of the European countries playing a significant role in the reinforcement effort [26] The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO could quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact The Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO throughout the Cold War in conventional forces, and especially in tanks and armoured vehicles Therefore, in the event of a Soviet invasion, in order not to resort to tactical nuclear strikes, NATO forces defending against a Warsaw Pact armored spearhead would have to be quickly resupplied and replaced.\n\n\nSeven Days to the River Rhine\nSeven Days to the River Rhine was a top-secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact It started with the assumption that NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the Vistula river valley in a first-strike scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties [27] In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany The Seven Days to the Rhine plan envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges and that large numbers of troops would die of radiation sickness It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit to get them to withhold the use of their nuclear weapons.\n\n\nExercise Able Archer\nExercise Able Archer was an annual exercise by the U.S European Command that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on the transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.\n\n\nStrategic Defense Initiative\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by US President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 [37] In the latter part of his presidency, numerous factors (which included watching the 1983 movie The Day After and hearing through a Soviet defector that Able Archer 83 almost triggered a Russian first strike) had turned Reagan against the concept of winnable nuclear war, and he began to see nuclear weapons as more of a \"wild card\" than a strategic deterrent Although he later believed in disarmament treaties slowly blunting the danger of nuclear weaponry by reducing their number and alert status, he also believed a technological solution might allow incoming ICBMs to be shot down, thus making the US invulnerable to a first strike However, the USSR saw the SDI concept as a major threat, since a unilateral deployment of the system would allow the US to launch a massive first strike on the Soviet Union without any fear of retaliation.\n\n\nNATO nuclear sharing\nNATO operational plans for a Third World War have involved NATO allies who do not have their nuclear weapons, using nuclear weapons supplied by the United States as part of a general NATO war plan, under the direction of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander.\n\n\nHistorical close calls\nWith the initiation of the Cold War arms race in the 1950s, an apocalyptic war between the United States and the Soviet Union became a real possibility During the Cold War era (1947–1991), several military events have been described as having come close to potentially triggering World War III Even after the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some incidents afterward have been described as close calls as well.\n\n\nKorean War: 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953\nThe Korean War was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the Korean Peninsula: a communist coalition including North Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States and the United Nations Command Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the US, the USSR, and China CBS News war correspondent Bill Downs wrote in 1951, \"To my mind, the answer is: Yes, Korea is the beginning of World War III The brilliant landings at Inchon and the cooperative efforts of the American armed forces with the United Nations Allies have won us a victory in Korea But this is only the first battle in a major international struggle which now is engulfing the Far East and the entire world.\" [44] Downs afterwards repeated this belief on ABC Evening News while reporting on the USS Pueblo incident in 1968 [45] Secretary of State Dean Acheson later acknowledged that the Truman administration was concerned about the escalation of the conflict and that General Douglas MacArthur warned him that a US-led intervention risked a Soviet response [46]\n\n\nBerlin Crisis: 4 June – 9 November 1961\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 was a political-military confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union at Checkpoint Charlie with both several American and Soviet/East German tanks and troops at the stand-off at each other only 100 yards on either side of the checkpoint The reason behind the confrontation was the occupational status of the German capital city, Berlin, and of post–World War II Germany The Berlin Crisis started when the USSR launched an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in West Berlin The crisis culminated in the city's de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall This stand-off ended peacefully on 28 October following a US–Soviet understanding to withdraw tanks and reduce tensions.\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis: 15–29 October 1962\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis, a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a third World War [47] The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day:\n\n\nSino-Soviet border conflicts: 2 March – 11 September 1969\nThe Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military border war between the Soviet Union and China at the height of the Sino-Soviet split in 1969 The most serious of these border clashes, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 in the vicinity of Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria.\n\n\nYom Kippur War superpower tensions: 6–25 October 1973\nThe Yom Kippur War, also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with a surprise invasion of Israeli-occupied territories by a coalition of Arab states, aided by the Soviet Union Israel successfully counterattacked with the aid of the US Tensions grew between the two superpowers: American and Soviet naval forces came close to firing upon each other in the Mediterranean Sea Admiral Daniel J Murphy of the US Sixth Fleet reckoned the chances of the Soviet squadron attempting a first strike against his fleet at 40 percent The Pentagon moved Defcon status from 4 to 3 [49] The superpowers had been pushed to the brink of war, but tensions eased with the ceasefire brought in under UNSC 339 [50] [51]\n\n\nNORAD computer error of 1979: 9 November 1979\nThe United States made emergency retaliation preparations after NORAD systems indicated that a full-scale Soviet attack had been launched [52] No attempt was made to use the Moscow–Washington hotline to clarify the situation with the USSR and it was not until early-warning radar systems confirmed no such launch had taken place that NORAD realized that a computer system test had caused the display errors A senator inside the NORAD facility at the time described an atmosphere of absolute panic A GAO investigation led to the construction of an off-site test facility to prevent similar mistakes [53]\n\n\nSoviet radar malfunction: 26 September 1983\nA false alarm occurred on the Soviet nuclear early warning system, showing the launch of American LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles from bases in the United States A retaliatory attack was prevented by Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet Air Defence Forces officer, who realised the system had simply malfunctioned (which was borne out by later investigations) [54] [55]\n\n\nAble Archer 83 escalations: 2–11 November 1983\nDuring Able Archer 83, a ten-day NATO exercise simulating a period of conflict escalation that culminated in a DEFCON 1 nuclear strike, some members of the Soviet Politburo and armed forces treated the events as a ruse of war concealing a genuine first strike In response, the military prepared for a coordinated counter-attack by readying nuclear forces and placing air units stationed in the Warsaw Pact states of East Germany and Poland under high alert However, the state of Soviet preparation for retaliation ceased upon completion of the Able Archer exercises [28]\n\n\nNorwegian rocket incident: 25 January 1995\nThe Norwegian rocket incident was the first World War III close call to occur after the Cold War had ended This incident occurred when Russia's Olenegorsk early warning station accidentally mistook the radar signature from a Black Brant XII research rocket (being jointly launched by Norwegian and US scientists from Andøya Rocket Range), as appearing to be the radar signature of the launch of a Trident SLBM missile In response, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was summoned and the Cheget nuclear briefcase was activated for the first and only time However, the high command was soon able to determine that the rocket was not entering Russian airspace, and promptly aborted plans for combat readiness and retaliation It was retrospectively determined that, while the rocket scientists had informed thirty states including Russia about the test launch, the information had not reached Russian radar technicians [56] [57]\n\n\nIncident at Pristina airport: 12 June 1999\nOn 12 June 1999, the day following the end of the Kosovo War, some 250 Russian peacekeepers occupied the Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO troops and were to secure the arrival of reinforcements by air American NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Wesley Clark ordered the use of force against the Russians [58] Mike Jackson, a British Army general who contacted the Russians during the incident, refused to enforce Clark's orders, famously telling him \"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you\" [59] Captain James Blunt, the lead officer at the front of the NATO column in the direct armed stand-off against the Russians, received the \"Destroy!\" orders from Clark over the radio, but he followed Jackson's orders to encircle the airfield instead and later said in an interview that even without Jackson's intervention he would have refused to follow Clark's order [60]\n\n\nShootdown of Sukhoi bomber: 24 November 2015\nOn 24 November 2015, at the border between Turkey and Syria, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian Sukhoi attack aircraft The Turks claimed that the aircraft violated Turkish airspace, a claim denied by the Russians; the plane was in the region as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war, in which Turkey supported opposing forces The incident was the first destruction of a Russian or Soviet Air Forces warplane by a NATO member state since the attack on the Sui-ho Dam during the Korean War in 1953 [61] [62] The incident led to numerous media and individuals commenting that it could have sparked and escalated into a world war [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nCurrent potential flashpoints\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 The Russian invasion started the largest war in Europe since World War II [66] Various experts, analysts, and others have described the invasion as heightening the risk of a third world war, [67] [68] [69] [70] while others have suggested the contrary [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine: 24 February 2022 – present\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 The Russian invasion started the largest war in Europe since World War II [66] Various experts, analysts, and others have described the invasion as heightening the risk of a third world war, [67] [68] [69] [70] while others have suggested the contrary [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nExtended usage of the term\nAs Soviet-American relations grew tense in the post-World War II period, the fear that the tension could escalate into World War III was ever-present A Gallup poll in December 1950 found that more than half of Americans considered World War III to have already started [97]\n\n\nCold War\nAs Soviet-American relations grew tense in the post-World War II period, the fear that the tension could escalate into World War III was ever-present A Gallup poll in December 1950 found that more than half of Americans considered World War III to have already started [97]\n\n\nWar on terror\nThe \"war on terror\" that began with the September 11 attacks has been claimed by some to be World War III [104] or sometimes World War IV [98] [105] (assuming the Cold War was World War III) Others have disparaged such claims as \"distorting American history\" While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two world wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a \"World War\" might now no longer require such worldwide and large-scale aggression and carnage Still, such claims of a new \"lower threshold of aggression\", that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a \"World War\" have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two world wars have received amongst historians [106]\n\n\nWar on the Islamic State\nOn 1 February 2015, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari declared that the war against the Islamic State was effectively \"World War III\", due to the Islamic State's aims for a worldwide caliphate, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the Levant region [107] In response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, King of Jordan Abdullah II stated \"We are facing a Third World War  [within Islam]\" [108]\n\n\nMultiple small wars as a \"third war\"\nIn multiple recorded interviews under somewhat casual circumstances, comparing the conflagrations of World War I and II to the ongoing lower-intensity wars of the 21st century, Pope Francis has said, \"The world is at war because it has lost the peace\", and \"perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal\" [110] [111]\n\n\nHypothetical scenarios\nIn 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of World War II, physicist Albert Einstein suggested that any outcome of a possible World War III would be so catastrophic upon human civilization so as to revert mankind to the Stone Age When asked by journalist Alfred Werner what types of weapons Einstein believed World War III might be fought with, Einstein warned, \"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones\" [112] [113]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

surpass the scale and intensity of the previous two world wars. The term has been used to describe various scenarios, including a nuclear war, a catastrophic global pandemic, or a prolonged period of international conflict. While the idea of a third world war has been a topic of concern and speculation for decades, the likelihood and nature of such a conflict remain uncertain.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"World War III\" was first used in a November 1941 issue of Time magazine, under the headline \"World War III?\" The article discussed the possibility of a global conflict involving the United States and Germany. In the following years, the term gained wider usage, particularly in the context of the Cold War. In 1949, physicist Albert Einstein suggested that a future world war would be so catastrophic that it would revert humanity to the Stone Age.\n\n**Military plans**\n\nMilitary strategists have long used war games to prepare for various war scenarios and determine the most effective strategies. War games were used for World War I and World War II, and have continued to be used in the decades since. Exercises such as Operation Unthinkable, Operation Dropshot, and Exercise Reforger were designed to test NATO's ability to respond to a Soviet invasion. These exercises involved simulations of nuclear and conventional warfare, and were used to assess the readiness and capabilities of NATO's military forces.\n\n**British-Irish cooperation**\n\nThe Republic of Ireland began planning for a possible nuclear war in the late 1940s, and cooperation between the United Kingdom and Ireland was established in the event of a WWIII. The two countries agreed to share weather data, control aids to navigation, and coordinate the Wartime Broadcasting Service. Operation Sandstone, a top-secret British-Irish military operation, was conducted from 1948 to 1955, and involved a coastal survey of Britain and Ireland.\n\n**Exercises and simulations**\n\nExercise Strikeback, held in 1957, was a major NATO naval exercise that simulated a response to an all-out Soviet attack. The exercise involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the United States Navy, the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, the French Navy, the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Navy. Exercise Reforger, an annual exercise conducted by NATO, tested the ability of the United States and its allies to carry out transcontinental reinforcement.\n\n**Strategic Defense Initiative**\n\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), proposed by US President Ronald Reagan in 1983, aimed to develop a technological solution to defend against incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles. The SDI concept was seen as a major threat by the Soviet Union, which believed it would allow the United States to launch a massive first strike without fear of retaliation.\n\n**NATO nuclear sharing**\n\nNATO operational plans for a Third World War involved allies who did not possess nuclear weapons using nuclear weapons supplied by the United States as part of a general NATO war plan. Under the direction of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, these allies would use nuclear weapons to support NATO's military objectives.\n\n**Historical close calls**\n\nSeveral military events have been described as having come close to potentially triggering World War III. These include the Korean War, the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Sino-Soviet border conflicts. In each of these cases, the situation was brought under control through diplomatic efforts and a commitment to avoiding escalation.\n\n**Modern potential flashpoints**\n\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014, has been described as a potential flashpoint for a wider conflict. The conflict has escalated in recent years, with Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordering a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This move has been met with international condemnation and has raised concerns about the potential for a wider conflict.\n\n**Extended usage of the term**\n\nThe term \"World War III\" has been used in various contexts beyond the traditional understanding of a global conflict involving major powers. It has been used to describe the \"war on terror,\" the conflict against the Islamic State, and the ongoing global conflicts in the 21st century. Some have suggested that these conflicts, while not necessarily global in scale, share similarities with the previous two world wars in terms of their intensity and impact on international relations.\n\n**Hypothetical scenarios**\n\nPhysicist Albert Einstein suggested that any outcome of a possible World War III would be so catastrophic that it would revert humanity to the Stone Age. When asked about the types of weapons that might be used in a future world war, Einstein warned that the next war would be fought with sticks and stones.\n\n**See also**\n\n* World War I\n* World War II\n* Cold War\n* War on terror\n* War on the Islamic State\n\n**References**\n\n* Einstein, A.

[14]\n\n\nMilitary plans\nMilitary strategists have used war games to prepare for various war scenarios and to determine the most appropriate strategies War games were utilized for World War I and World War II [15]\n\n\nOperation Unthinkable\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was concerned that, with the enormous size of Soviet Red Army forces deployed in Central and Eastern Europe at the end of World War II and the unreliability of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, there was a serious threat to Western Europe In April–May 1945, the British Armed Forces developed Operation Unthinkable, thought to be the first scenario of the Third World War [16] Its primary goal was \"to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire\" [17] The plan was rejected by the British Chiefs of Staff Committee as militarily unfeasible.\n\n\nOperation Dropshot\nOperation Dropshot was the 1950s United States contingency plan for a possible nuclear and conventional war with the Soviet Union in the Western European and Asian theaters Although the scenario made use of nuclear weapons, they were not expected to play a decisive role.\n\n\nBritish-Irish cooperation\nThe Republic of Ireland started planning for a possible nuclear war in the late 1940s Co-operation between the United Kingdom and Ireland would be formed in the event of WWIII, where they would share weather data, control aids to navigation, and coordinate the Wartime Broadcasting Service that would occur after a nuclear attack [18] Operation Sandstone in Ireland was a top-secret British-Irish military operation [18] The armed forces from both states began a coastal survey of Britain and Ireland cooperating from 1948 to 1955 This was a request from the United States to identify suitable landing grounds for the US in the event of a successful Soviet invasion [18] [19] By 1953, the co-operation agreed upon sharing information on wartime weather and the evacuation of civilian refugees from Britain to Ireland [18] Ireland's Operation Sandstone ended in 1966 [19]\n\n\nExercises Grand Slam, Longstep, and Mainbrace\nIn January 1950, the North Atlantic Council approved NATO's military strategy of containment [20] NATO military planning took on a renewed urgency following the outbreak of the Korean War in the early 1950s, prompting NATO to establish a \"force under a centralized command, adequate to deter aggression and to ensure the defense of Western Europe\" Allied Command Europe was established under General of the Army Dwight D Eisenhower, US Army, on 2 April 1951 [21] [22] The Western Union Defence Organization had previously carried out Exercise Verity, a 1949 multilateral exercise involving naval air strikes and submarine attacks.\n\n\nExercise

quickly resupplied and replaced.\n\n\nSeven Days to the River Rhine\nSeven Days to the River Rhine was a top-secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact It started with the assumption that NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the Vistula river valley in a first-strike scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties [27] In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish

European Command that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on the transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.\n\n\nStrategic Defense Initiative\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by US President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 [37] In the latter part of his presidency, numerous factors

well.\n\n\nKorean War: 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953\nThe Korean War was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the Korean Peninsula: a communist coalition including North Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States and the United Nations Command Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the US, the USSR, and China CBS News war correspondent Bill Downs wrote in 1951, \"To my mind, the answer is: Yes, Korea is the beginning of World War III The brilliant landings at Inchon and the cooperative efforts of the American armed forces with the United Nations Allies have won us a victory in Korea But this is only the first battle in a major international struggle which now is engulfing the Far East and the entire world.\" [44] Downs afterwards repeated this belief on ABC Evening News while reporting on the USS Pueblo incident in 1968 [45] Secretary of State Dean Acheson later acknowledged that the Truman administration was concerned about the escalation of the conflict and that General Douglas MacArthur warned him that a US-led intervention risked a Soviet response [46]\n\n\nBerlin Crisis: 4 June – 9 November 1961\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 was a political-military confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union at Checkpoint Charlie with both several American and Soviet/East German tanks and troops at the stand-off at each other only 100 yards on either side of the checkpoint The reason behind the confrontation was the occupational status of the German capital city, Berlin, and of post–World War II Germany The Berlin Crisis started when the USSR launched an ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of all armed forces from Berlin, including the Western armed forces in West Berlin The crisis culminated in the city's de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall This stand-off ended peacefully on 28 October following a US–Soviet understanding to withdraw tanks and reduce tensions.\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis: 15–29 October 1962\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis, a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in response to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a third World War [47] The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day:\n\n\nSino-Soviet border conflicts: 2 March – 11 September 1969\nThe Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military border war between the Soviet Union and China at the height of the Sino-Soviet split in 1969 The most serious of these border clashes, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 in the vicinity of Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria.\n\n\nYom Kippur War superpower tensions: 6–25 October 1973\nThe Yom Kippur War, also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with a surprise invasion of Israeli-occupied territories by a coalition of Arab states, aided by the Soviet Union Israel successfully counterattacked with the aid of the US Tensions grew between the two superpowers: American and Soviet naval forces came close to firing upon each other in the Mediterranean Sea Admiral Daniel J Murphy of the US Sixth Fleet reckoned the chances of the Soviet squadron attempting a first strike against his fleet at 40 percent The Pentagon moved Defcon status from 4 to 3 [49] The superpowers had been pushed to the brink of war, but tensions eased with the ceasefire brought in under UNSC 339 [50] [51]\n\n\nNORAD computer error of 1979: 9 November 1979\nThe United States made emergency retaliation preparations after NORAD systems indicated that a full-scale Soviet attack had been launched [52] No attempt was made to use the Moscow–Washington hotline to clarify the situation with the USSR and it was not until early-warning radar systems confirmed no such launch had taken place that NORAD realized that a computer system test had caused the display errors A senator inside the NORAD facility at the time described an atmosphere of absolute panic A GAO investigation led to the construction of an off-site test facility to prevent similar mistakes [53]\n\n\nSoviet radar malfunction: 26 September 1983\nA false alarm occurred on the Soviet nuclear early warning system, showing the launch of American LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles from bases in the United States A retaliatory attack was prevented by Stanislav Petrov, a Soviet Air Defence Forces officer, who realised the system had simply malfunctioned (which was borne out by later investigations) [54] [55]\n\n\nAble Archer 83 escalations: 2–11 November 1983\nDuring Able Archer 83, a ten-day NATO exercise simulating a period of conflict escalation that culminated in a DEFCON 1 nuclear strike, some members of the Soviet Politburo and armed forces treated the events as a ruse of war concealing a genuine first strike In response, the military prepared for a coordinated counter-attack by readying nuclear forces and placing air units stationed in the Warsaw Pact states of East Germany and Poland under high alert However, the state of Soviet preparation for retaliation ceased upon completion of the Able Archer exercises [28]\n\n\nNorwegian rocket incident: 25 January 1995\nThe Norwegian rocket incident was the first World War III close call to occur after the Cold War had ended This incident occurred when Russia's Olenegorsk early warning station accidentally mistook the radar signature from a Black Brant XII research rocket (being jointly launched by Norwegian and US scientists from Andøya Rocket Range), as appearing to be the radar signature of the launch of a Trident SLBM missile In response, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was summoned and the Cheget nuclear briefcase was activated for the first and only time However, the high command was soon able to determine that the rocket was not entering Russian airspace, and promptly aborted plans for combat readiness and retaliation It was retrospectively determined that, while the rocket scientists had informed thirty states including Russia about the test launch, the information had not reached Russian radar technicians [56] [57]\n\n\nIncident at Pristina airport: 12 June 1999\nOn 12 June 1999, the day following the end of the Kosovo War, some 250 Russian peacekeepers occupied the Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO troops and were to secure the arrival of reinforcements by air American NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Wesley Clark ordered the use of force against the Russians [58] Mike Jackson, a British Army general who contacted the Russians during the incident, refused to enforce Clark's orders, famously telling him \"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you\" [59] Captain James Blunt, the lead officer at the front of the NATO column in the direct armed stand-off against the Russians, received the \"Destroy!\" orders from Clark over the radio, but he followed Jackson's orders to encircle the airfield instead and later said in an interview that even without Jackson's intervention he would have refused to follow Clark's order [60]\n\n\nShootdown of Sukhoi bomber: 24 November 2015\nOn 24 November 2015, at the border between Turkey and Syria, the Turkish Air Force shot down a Russian Sukhoi attack aircraft The Turks claimed that the aircraft violated Turkish airspace, a claim denied by the Russians; the plane was in the region as part of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war, in which Turkey supported opposing forces The incident was the first destruction of a Russian or Soviet Air Forces warplane by a NATO member state since the attack on the Sui-ho Dam during the Korean War in 1953 [61] [62] The incident led to numerous media and individuals commenting that it could have sparked and escalated into a world war [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nCurrent potential flashpoints\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 The Russian invasion started the largest war in Europe since World War II [66] Various experts, analysts, and others have described the invasion as heightening the risk of a third world war, [67] [68] [69] [70] while others have suggested the contrary [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine: 24 February 2022 – present\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, marking a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began in 2014 The Russian invasion started the largest war in Europe since World War II [66] Various experts, analysts, and others have described the invasion as heightening the risk of a third world war, [67] [68] [69] [70] while others have suggested the contrary [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nExtended usage of the term\nAs Soviet-American relations grew tense in the post-World War II period, the fear that the tension could escalate into World War III was ever-present A Gallup poll in December 1950 found that more than half of Americans considered World War III to have already started [97]\n\n\nCold War\nAs Soviet-American relations grew tense in the post-World War II period, the fear that the tension could escalate into World War III was ever-present A Gallup poll in December 1950 found that more than half of Americans considered World War III to have already started [97]\n\n\nWar on terror\nThe \"war on terror\" that began with the September 11 attacks has been claimed by some to be World War III [104] or sometimes World War IV [98] [105] (assuming the Cold War was World War III) Others have disparaged such claims as \"distorting American history\" While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two world wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a \"World War\" might now no longer require such worldwide and large-scale aggression and carnage Still, such claims of a new \"lower threshold of aggression\", that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a \"World War\" have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two world wars have received amongst historians [106]\n\n\nWar on the Islamic State\nOn 1 February 2015, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari declared that the war against the Islamic State was effectively \"World War III\", due to the Islamic State's aims for a worldwide caliphate, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the Levant region [107] In response to the November 2015 Paris attacks, King of Jordan Abdullah II stated \"We are facing a Third World War  [within Islam]\" [108]\n\n\nMultiple small wars as a \"third war\"\nIn multiple recorded interviews under somewhat casual circumstances, comparing the conflagrations of World War I and II to the ongoing lower-intensity wars of the 21st century, Pope Francis has said, \"The world is at war because it has lost the peace\", and \"perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal\" [110] [111]\n\n\nHypothetical scenarios\nIn 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of World War II, physicist Albert Einstein suggested that any outcome of a possible World War III would be so catastrophic upon human civilization so as to revert mankind to the Stone Age When asked by journalist Alfred Werner what types of weapons Einstein believed World War III might be fought with, Einstein warned, \"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones\" [112] [113]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

{"title": "Star_Trek:_Strange_New_Worlds", "content": "\nPremise\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds follows Captain Christopher Pike (played by Anson Mount) and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) in the 23rd century as they explore new worlds throughout the galaxy in the decade before Star Trek: The Original Series [1] [2] It has a contemporary take on that series'

disappointed to find that this was not the case, [44] and with his encouragement the Enterprise was introduced in the first-season finale [45] Then co-showrunner Aaron Harberts wanted to explore Pike,

long filming schedule was difficult and his return would involve \"a lot of creative conversations\", [56] but he later added that he had never had such a positive response to his work as he did for Pike and the role \"changed  [his] life\" [57] Kurtzman also expressed interest in the idea, saying, \"The fans have been heard Anything is possible in the world of Trek.\" [58]\n\n\nWriting\nKurtzman felt audiences had primarily responded to the \"relentless optimism\" of Pike, Spock, and Number One on Discovery, and said Strange New Worlds would explore how Pike remains an optimistic leader

Discovery and Picard, [72] feeling that the purpose of the series was to carry on the optimistic messages of The Original Series It was important to him to explore current social and political issues in the series, as all previous Star Trek projects had, [3] and to ignore elements of characterization from The Original Series that were no longer appropriate, such as its portrayal of female

approached the series as if Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry was making The Original Series with modern technology and effects, keeping elements of the 1960s designs that still worked for a contemporary project while avoiding the parts that looked \"cheap\" He compared this to the first Star Trek film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), which also used its budget and resources to expand on the original designs [3] Mount said the sets had a \"mid-century modern look from the 1960s There are some pieces that you might find in a super upscale version of Macy's in 1967 It retains that cool '60s vibe, but in an updated way\" [57] The Enterprise sets for Strange New Worlds were updated from the Discovery ones, [84] such as the bridge set being more compact and closer to the size

practical viewscreen to replace the visual effects that Discovery used Lee wanted the bridge to feel \"warmer\" than Discovery's cool blue and green palette, especially using the colors of the on-set monitor graphics to achieve this [85] The engineering, mess hall, and cargo bay sets were augmented with virtual production technology [86] The props were also redesigned from the Discovery ones:

composing the rest of the score Melumad previously composed the music for Star Trek: Prodigy and an episode of Short Treks, [103] [104] and approached each episode as if it was a feature film [104]

The show was created by Devki Nandan Tripathi and produced by Rashmi Sharma Telefilms. The series revolves around the story of Gopi Bahu (Giaa Manek) and her struggles within her family.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe show begins with Gopi Bahu, an orphan who lives with her aunt Urmila Shah, uncle Jeetu Shah, and cousin Rashi. Kokila Modi, Gopi's mother-in-law, decides to get her son Ahem Modi married to Gopi. However, Urmila and Rashi plot to get Rashi married to Jigar, Ahem's friend. Ahem and Gopi get married, while Jigar and Rashi get married. Kokila trains and supports Gopi to become self-confident and educated.\n\nAs the story progresses, Gopi's sister Kinjal is married to Urmila's nephew, Dhaval Desai. Rashi often tries to create trouble for Gopi but later regrets. Ahem, who initially berates Gopi for her illiteracy, later realizes her worth and rejects his girlfriend, Anita. Gopi has a daughter, Meera, while Rashi has twin sons, Sahir and Samar.\n\nGopi's long-lost parents, Madhu and Jayantilal, reunite with Gopi's sister Radha. Radha marries Kinjal's ex-boyfriend, Umang Mehta, whose first wife, Tripti, murders him. Tripti blames Gopi for Umang's death, which Radha believes. However, Kokila works together with Gopi and Rashi to find out the truth and later reveals Umang and Tripti's intentions to Radha, thus sentencing Tripti to eight years of imprisonment.\n\nGopi finds out she is pregnant again. Yet again, Tripti brainwashes Radha against Gopi. When the family is out for a picnic, Radha schemes an accident to kill Meera, which results in Gopi accidentally slipping and throwing baby Meera in the river. Kokila holds Gopi responsible for Meera's death and a guilty Gopi leaves the Modi house.\n\nEight years later, Gopi raises her second daughter, Vidya, single-handedly. Kokila decides to get Ahem married to Radha. On the day of the marriage, Rashi finds Gopi and with the help of Samar, Sahir, Pappu, and Vidya, they make a plan to remarry Ahem and Gopi and are successful in doing so. Gopi reveals to the family that Vidya is their daughter.\n\nKokila finds out that Meera is alive and was ill-treated by Radha and made to grow up as an orphan in a temple. Kokila decides to expose them but Tripti causes her accident, which leads to her losing her partial memory. Gopi and Ahem bring a girl, Gauri, to the house who turns out to be Meera. Kokila regains her memory, and the whole family is reunited after Radha's crimes are revealed, and she is sent to jail along with Tripti for trying to kill her and Meera.\n\nTen years later, Gopi is released from jail after a reduction of four years in her sentence and is shocked to learn that Kokila does not live in the Modi house anymore and is a maid at a fake-mentally-ill Urmila's house. Paridhi refuses to foster Rashi and does not let her stay at the Modi House. Ahem has broken all ties with the Modis and lives with Meera, Vidya, and a woman, Mansi Raheja (caretaker of Meera and Vidya) in Bandra, Mumbai. He runs a bakery shop called MV (after Meera-Vidya). Kinjal separates from Dhaval and lives at Modi's house after an argument, which causes Urmila's fake memory loss. Gopi's mother Madhu escapes after failing to take Rashi Jr with her.\n\nFour years later, Gopi has been in depression since Ahem's demise and has not talked in years. Paridhi has thrown Sahir and Sona out of the Modi mansion and got Samar married to a rich girl named Monica Baa. Chirag, Hetal, and Parag have moved to America for Baa's treatment. While Dhaval, Kinjal, and Pappu have moved to London. Vidya has a four-year-old daughter with Shravan, Priyal. Kokila fixes Gopi's marriage with her therapist and doctor, Krishna Raheja, who turns out to be Mansi's brother and wants to take revenge on Gopi for separating Mansi and Ahem. Soon, Gopi and Kokila meet Ahem's look-alike, Jaggi, and request him to save Gopi from Krishna's evil plans.

Born on 2 May 2015, she is the granddaughter of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n**Infancy**\n\nPrincess Charlotte was born at 08:34 BST on 2 May 2015 in St Mary's Hospital, London, during the reign of her paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. Her birth was marked by gun salutes and illuminating London landmarks pink. The hospital where she was born is the same one where her older brother, Prince George, was born in 2013. Her parents, Prince William and Catherine, were present at the birth and were seen leaving the hospital with their newborn daughter.\n\nOn 4 May, her name was announced as Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, honouring her grandfather Charles, her great-grandmother, and her grandmother Diana. The name Charlotte is a nod to her father's mother, Diana, while Elizabeth is a tribute to her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. Diana is a tribute to her grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nCharlotte was christened on 5 July by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. The ceremony was attended by close family members, including her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents.\n\n**Upbringing**\n\nThe family lived at Anmer Hall in Norfolk during Charlotte's infancy, before relocating to Kensington Palace in 2017. Anmer Hall is a country house on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. It was where the family spent their summer holidays and where Charlotte spent her early days. The move to Kensington Palace marked a significant change in the family's lifestyle, as they began to take on more royal duties and appearances.\n\nIn January 2018, Charlotte started at Willcocks Nursery School in London. The school is a private nursery school that caters to children from the age of six months to five years. Charlotte's older brother, Prince George, also attended the school. In September 2019, she joined her elder brother George at Thomas's School in Battersea, where she was known as Charlotte Cambridge. The school is a private preparatory school that caters to children from the age of five to 11.\n\nIn 2022, the family relocated to Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park, after which she and her brothers, George and Louis, began attending Lambrook, an independent preparatory school in Berkshire. The school is a private preparatory school that caters to children from the age of four to 11.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nDespite the efforts of her parents to shelter their children from public view, photographs and public appearances of Charlotte continue to cause media frenzies. Shopping statistics and polls among parents show that Charlotte is a major children's style icon. Her fashion sense and style are closely followed by the media and the general public. Brand Finance previously estimated that she will be worth more than £3 billion to the British economy throughout her lifetime.\n\nIn August 2023, Reader's Digest valued her at $4.6 billion or £3.6 billion. The valuation is based on her potential earnings from endorsement deals, fashion collaborations, and other business ventures. The valuation highlights the significant economic impact that Charlotte is expected to have throughout her lifetime.\n\n**Title and Styles**\n\nCharlotte is a British princess with the official style and title \"Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Wales.\" Before her father was created Prince of Wales on 9 September 2022, Charlotte was styled \"Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.\" The change in title reflects her father's new title and the change in the family's status.\n\n**Succession**\n\nCharlotte is third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her father and elder brother.

{"title": "Donda_(album)", "content": "\nBackground\nDuring a conversation with French fashion designer Michèle Lamy in an Instagram Live stream on May 25, 2020, American cinematographer Arthur Jafa revealed that he was working on video material with West for a single from his forthcoming album, titled God's Country [1] On July 21, West confirmed the album title had been changed to Donda in honor of his mother, after whom he had also named his creative company [2] [3] The album had its name briefly changed to Donda: With Child, which was later reversed [4] West announced a release date of July 24, and posted a track listing for the album In the following days, West continued to post track listings, only to subsequently delete them [2] Ultimately, the album missed its planned release date [5] In September 2020, West sent out a series of tweets about his relationship with Universal Music, mostly addressing his desire to buy his master recordings back from them [6] The rapper asserted that these efforts were obstructed by his signed contracts, succeeding this by tweeting multiple images that supposedly showed the contracts [6]\n\n\nRecording\nThe recording sessions began a month after Jesus Is King was released [14] Producer BoogzDaBeast recalled that he was called in to Wyoming with West telling him \"Man we're going back in, we're about to do a new album Let's keep this going.\" [14] BoogzDaBeast came to Wyoming with 166 beats, which the producer clarified that they were mostly unfinished ideas [14] Of those 166 ideas, West freestyled over 99 of them in what the producer calls \"That One Night in Wyoming\" Songs such as \"Wash Us in the Blood\"–which was originally set for release on Donda in 2020, but was left off the final album–and \"Lord I Need You\" were originally conceived during said session [15]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating [82] [63] [76] \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin [63] [65] The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", [69] pop, and alternative rock, [74] incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs [73] [64] [83] The song contains almost no drums, [84] until the last segment of the track brings a \"brief, stilted drum pattern\", [73] described as industrial percussion [85] \"God Breathed\" has an abrasive, industrial sound that was compared to Yeezus, [73] [63] and features West offering redemption, reaffirming his trust in God before a wordless choir performs the outro [66] [67] [76] Playboi Carti and fellow rapper Fivio Foreign attempt to find a balance between faith in themselves and faith in God within their verses on \"Off the Grid\", [63] [86] later being followed by West providing a revelation of his religious mission statement in the closing verse and at one point, he dubs God \"my bestie\" [65] [71] The song has an intense drill beat, featuring a \"melodically complex\" bassline and a \"sustained choir\" [66] \"Hurricane\" is an R&B song, [64] with layered organs and processed choir vocals that are cut akin to a sample [84] [87] West touches on personal issues such as his breakup with Kardashian and his house, while the hook sees the Weeknd exude confidence and Lil Baby provides a mournful performance [64] [78] [83] \"Praise God\" contains a vocal sample of Donda West proclaiming, \"Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night.\" [80] Lyrically, the song features Baby Keem mixing \"worship with the dark carnality of the mosh pit\" and Kanye West connecting his issues to God's mysterious behavior [76] [83] \"Jonah\" sees him rapping about his relationship with God, [78] alongside fellow rappers Vory and Lil Durk opening up about their pain of losing friends and family members, respectively [64] [83]\n\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDonda covers the stylistic groundwork of West's previous albums; [63] [64] it has been described as a hip hop, [65] [66] gospel, [67] [68] progressive rap, [66] and pop record, [69] [70] while the album also includes elements of trap, drill, boom bap, [71] hip house, and rock [72] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood described it as a blend of Yeezus's rough industrial hip hop, the \"church-organ gospel\" of West's previous studio album Jesus Is King (2019), the \"gothic swagger\" of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and the \"bleeping\" electropop of 808s & Heartbreak (2008) [64] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic perceived that \"stylistic innovation has driven West's career\" continuously, but he possibly \"conceives of Donda as the album of his life—a capstone, an anthology\" [63] However, the album is unusual in his catalog due to its lack of drums, outside of a light amount of snares and occasional synth basses that imitate rhythm sections [73] [47] Donda's integration of gospel music is more subtle than that of its predecessor, [74] [75] instead favoring the usage of trap beats and Auto-Tune [68] [76] At Pitchfork, Dylan Green noted the production \"jumps\" from trap and drill to boom-bap and gospel, invoking GOOD Music's compilation album Cruel Summer (2012) [71]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating [82] [63] [76] \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin [63] [65] The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", [69] pop, and alternative rock, [74] incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs [73] [64] [83] The song

losing friends and family members, respectively [64] [83]\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nOn June 26, 2020, West unveiled a collaboration between his fashion company Yeezy and clothing retailer Gap, and also launched the #WestDayEver promotional campaign on Twitter that accompanied announcements of different projects [91] One of the projects was a music video for the track \"Wash Us in the Blood\" that features fellow rapper Travis Scott, directed by Jafa; the video was released simultaneously with the song on June 30, following a teaser in which West officially announced the album's title as God's Country [91] [92] The track was set to be included on Donda, but did not appear on the final track listing [93] [5] On July 13, 2020, Kanye shared a snippet on Twitter of a song titled \"Donda\", which featured his late mother Donda West reciting KRS-One's \"Sound of da Police\" (1993) and was accompanied by archival footage, including the Wests rapping together [94] The song was replaced with another track also titled \"Donda\" on the final track listing On September 26, 2020, West shared a 39-second snippet of the track \"Believe What I Say\" to Twitter [95] West later released a song entitled \"Nah Nah Nah\" on October 26, calling the song his 2020 presidential campaign's theme music; it includes him referencing his candidacy [96] On November 13, 2020, West released a remix of \"Nah Nah Nah\" that features fellow rappers DaBaby and 2 Chainz [97] After the original and remix were both removed from streaming services in the lead up to Donda's release, neither of them made the final cut [98] [73]\n\n\nCover art\nOn July 25, 2020, West tweeted out an album cover, [133] showing an infrared scheme of orange and red mirroring the shape of the people, sun, and moon in the sky, backed by green mountains alongside purple and white clouds designed by Pierre-Louis Auvray [92] In the lead up to the first Donda listening event on July 22, 2021, a possible replacement cover was used as the promo artwork The cover was an adaptation of a Louise Bourgeois gouache painting that had been created in 2007, the same year as Donda West's death, and included in Bourgeois' series Les têtes bleues et les femmes rouges (2015) [134] [135] In the painting, a woman is shown in monochromatic red and a matching ponytail flows behind her, while a fertility idol is also partially present [134] [135] After Kanye West posted numerous potential covers, a plain black square was ultimately used as the artwork for the album [136]\n\n\nStreaming performance and updates\nIn its first day of release, Donda earned the second-biggest global Spotify debut for album streams ever, with nearly 100 million streams, and broke the record for the biggest first day streams of 2021 on the service that was set by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour [137] [138] The album also set a new record by reaching number one on Apple Music's top albums chart in 152 countries in its first day, and earned the third-biggest first day debut streams for an album Donda broke the 2021 record for the most-streamed album in one day on Apple Music, while 19 of the top-20 tracks on the service's Top 100 Global songs chart were from the album [139] Donda amassed 60 million first day streams in the United States on Apple, setting a streaming record for 2021 in the country [140] After eight days of streaming, it had reached around 423 million on-demand audio streams in the US [141] 25 of the tracks debuted with the top-40 of Spotify's U.S chart, with 10 of them occupying the top-10 [137] The album's 2021 record for first day Spotify streams was broken by Certified Lover Boy, which also surpassed its eight-day total of US on-demand audio streams within three days, amassing over 430 million streams [141] [142] By October 26, the former had amassed over a billion streams on Spotify, becoming West's fastest album to achieve this milestone [143]\n\n\nDonda Stem Player\nOn August 25, 2021, West announced the Donda Stem Player via his website, a standalone music player allowing users to remix the album's songs using their stems [145] [146] [147] Users are also given the ability to control vocals, drums, bass, and samples, isolate parts, and add effects [145] [146] [148] The player was announced as being set to be released by West's brand Yeezy Tech in collaboration with Kano Computing and sold for $200 [146] [147] [149] On October 27, 2021, the Donda Stem Player was made available by West, with three extra songs being included The new songs are a censored edit of \"Life of the Party\", \"Up from the Ashes\", and an updated version of \"Never Abandon Your Family\" In addition, the player contains a version of \"Remote Control\" that re-adds Kid Cudi's original contribution [150] [151] On November 17, 2021, the Donda Stem Player website was updated to include downloadable stems for Jesus Is King On December 10, 2021, stems for \"Wash Us in the Blood\" were added in an update [152]\n\n\nDeluxe edition\nOn November 5, 2021, in an interview with N.O.R.E on Drink Champs, West announced that a deluxe version of Donda was set to be released, teasing a song called \"Let Go\" [154] [155] Eight days later, billboards advertising the deluxe edition appeared around Los Angeles [156] On November 14, 2021, Donda (Deluxe) was released to streaming services [48] Simultaneously, an explicit version of \"Life of the Party\" was released as a single from the deluxe edition [157] The song charted at number 13 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart [158] A 2xCD physical version of the deluxe edition was released on February 11, 2022 [159] A 4xLP deluxe gatefold version was released on vinyl on June 24, 2022 [160]\n\n\nListening events\nTo promote Donda prior to its release, West held a series of listening events During the album's events, guest appearances from various artists were revealed, including Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Pusha T, Jay-Z, Lil Yachty, Vory, KayCyy, Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Jay Electronica, Pop Smoke, the Sunday Service Choir, DaBaby, Marilyn Manson, and the Weeknd [161] [162] [163] West had updated Donda after each listening event like he did with his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo (2016), changing content such as the features on songs [164] Speaking with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Dean depicted the process as \"interesting\" and \"gruelling\", remembering \"lots of hours\" and changes, from which the album \"came out great\" He elaborated by explaining that \"each listening party was like a test\" of sorts, with West succeeding each one by taking all \"the information he got from everyone, including online reviews  [and] personal friends' reviews\", then \"digest [ing] it all\" in a manner to \"adjust\" Donda \"the way\" he wanted [165]\n\n\nCritical reception\nDonda received mixed reviews from music critics [196] At Metacritic, the album received an weighted mean score of 53, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [194] Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it a 5.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus [193]\n\n\nCriticism of guest artists\nThe revelation of DaBaby and Marilyn Manson as guest artists during Donda's August 26 listening event was met with intense disapproval from critics due to the respective allegations of homophobia and sexual abuse against them [115] [197] According to Jem Aswad of Variety, \"West was widely accused of trolling the public, among other things, after  [the] event.\" [114] In response, as Ellen Durney of BuzzFeed News wrote, \"some fans\" suggested that the inclusion of DaBaby and Manson might have been West's \"attempt at commentary on 'cancel culture'\", [198] and Consequence writer Alex Young provided a similar presumption [199] West defended DaBaby's presence, recalling him being \"the only person who said he would vote for me in public\" [115] An unspecified source told People about West's decision to work with the rapper and Marilyn Manson: \"He knows that having controversial figures around will be provocative and will get people to talking.\" The source continued by opening up that West knows \"people are going to be upset\" and he will experience \"backlash\", and is also aware \"people are talking about it today when they wouldn't have been otherwise\" [115] [200] [201]\n\n\nAccolades\nOn Complex's list of the best albums of 2021, Donda was placed sixth [203] Similarly, Time ranked the album at number seven on their list for the year [204] On Caramanica's list of the best albums of 2021, the deluxe edition was placed at number 10 Caramanica said it \"lives at the intersection\" of West's Yeezus and Jesus eras, commenting that the \"scabrous, churning production that sets a chaotic mood\" is accompanied by \"moments of intense searching, gasps for air amid the unrest\" [205] Associated Press listed Donda as among the top 10 albums of the year [206] Billboard placed it at number 39 on their \"The 50 Best Albums of 2021: Staff List\", with Heran Mamo declaring that West confronts his inner demons and \"yearns for mercy without two key women\" in his mother and Kardashian [207]\n\n\nCommercial performance\nDonda debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after a five-day period of tracking, with 309,000 album-equivalent units that consisted of 272,000 streaming-equivalent album units, 37,000 pure album sales, and less than 1,000 track-equivalent units [209] [210] The album-equivalent units set a record for the highest amount of 2021,

of number-ones on the chart It also marked West's 10th consecutive album to debut at the summit, tying him with Eminem's record [209] It also reached the summit of the US Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts, becoming West's second album to top the two charts and achieving the biggest unit week for both [211] The album entered atop the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, on which it was the rapper's 10th chart-topper [212] 23 of Donda's tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, leading to West joining Drake as one of the two artists to have 23 or more songs chart simultaneously This also increased West's Hot 100 entries to 133, the fifth most of any act, a ranking he attained for top-40 hits as well by having scored 68 \"Hurricane\" was the highest charting track, reaching number six and becoming West's 19th top-20 hit [120] The 23 tracks took up the top-23 spots on both the US Christian Songs and Gospel Songs charts, exceeding West's record of all top-10 positions on the former chart and the top-11 on the latter [211] As a result of the album and its tracks, West went up from number 67 to the top position on the Billboard Artist 100, giving him his third week atop the

Of those 166 ideas, West freestyled over 99 of them in what the producer calls \"That One Night in Wyoming\" Songs such as \"Wash Us in the Blood\"–which was originally set for release on Donda in 2020, but was left off the final album–and \"Lord I Need You\" were originally conceived during said session.\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute. It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating. \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin. The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", pop, and alternative rock, incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs. The song contains almost no drums, until the last segment of the track brings a \"brief, stilted drum pattern\", described as industrial percussion.\n\n\"God Breathed\" has an abrasive, industrial sound that was compared to Yeezus, and features West offering redemption, reaffirming his trust in God before a wordless choir performs the outro. Playboi Carti and fellow rapper Fivio Foreign attempt to find a balance between faith in themselves and faith in God within their verses on \"Off the Grid\", later being followed by West providing a revelation of his religious mission statement in the closing verse and at one point, he dubs God \"my bestie\". The song has an intense drill beat, featuring a \"melodically complex\" bassline and a \"sustained choir\".\n\n\"Hurricane\" is an R&B song, with layered organs and processed choir vocals that are cut akin to a sample. West touches on personal issues such as his breakup with Kardashian and his house, while the hook sees the Weeknd exude confidence and Lil Baby provides a mournful performance. \"Praise God\" contains a vocal sample of Donda West proclaiming, \"Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night.\" Lyrically, the song features Baby Keem mixing \"worship with the dark carnality of the mosh pit\" and Kanye West connecting his issues to God's mysterious behavior.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDonda covers the stylistic groundwork of West's previous albums. It has been described as a hip hop, gospel, progressive rap, and pop record, while the album also includes elements of trap, drill, boom bap, hip house, and rock. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood described it as a blend of Yeezus's rough industrial hip hop, the \"church-organ gospel\" of West's previous studio album Jesus Is King (2019), the \"gothic swagger\" of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), and the \"bleeping\" electropop of 808s & Heartbreak (2008).\n\nSpencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic perceived that \"stylistic innovation has driven West's career\" continuously, but he possibly \"conceives of Donda as the album of his life—a capstone, an anthology\". However, the album is unusual in his catalog due to its lack of drums, outside of a light amount of snares and occasional synth basses that imitate rhythm sections. Donda's integration of gospel music is more subtle than that of its predecessor, instead favoring the usage of trap beats and Auto-Tune.\n\nRelease and promotion\nOn June 26, 2020, West unveiled a collaboration between his fashion company Yeezy and clothing retailer Gap, and also launched the #WestDayEver promotional campaign on Twitter that accompanied announcements of different projects. One of the projects was a music video for the track \"Wash Us in the Blood\" that features fellow rapper Travis Scott, directed by Jafa; the video was released simultaneously with the song on June 30, following a teaser in which West officially announced the album's title as God's Country. The track was set to be included on Donda, but did not appear on the final track listing.\n\nOn July 13, 2020, Kanye shared a snippet on Twitter of a song titled \"Donda\", which featured his late mother Donda West reciting KRS-One's \"Sound of da Police\" (1993) and was accompanied by archival footage, including the Wests rapping together. The song was replaced with another track also titled \"Donda\" on the final track listing. On September 26, 2020, West shared a 39-second snippet of the track \"Believe What I Say\" to Twitter. West later released a song entitled \"Nah Nah Nah\" on October 26, calling the song his 2020 presidential campaign's theme music; it includes him referencing his candidacy.\n\nOn November 13, 2020, West released a remix of \"Nah Nah Nah\" that features fellow rappers DaBaby and 2 Chainz. After the original and remix were both removed from streaming services in the lead up to Donda's release, neither of them made the final cut.\n\nCover art\nOn July 25, 2020, West tweeted out an album cover, showing an infrared scheme of orange and red mirroring the shape of the people, sun, and moon in the sky, backed by green mountains alongside purple and white clouds designed by Pierre-Louis Auvray. In the lead up to the first Donda listening event on July 22, 2021, a possible replacement cover was used as the promo artwork. The cover was an adaptation of a Louise Bourgeois gouache painting that had been created in 2007, the same year as Donda West's death, and included in Bourgeois' series Les têtes bleues et les femmes rouges (2015).\n\nIn the painting, a woman is shown in monochromatic red and a matching ponytail flows behind her, while a fertility idol is also partially present. After Kanye West posted numerous potential covers, a plain black square was ultimately used as the artwork for the album.\n\nStreaming performance and updates\nIn its first day of release, Donda earned the second-biggest global Spotify debut for album streams ever, with nearly 100 million streams, and broke the record for the biggest first day streams of 2021 on the service that was set by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour. The album also set a new record by reaching number one on Apple Music's top albums chart in 152 countries in its first day, and earned the third-biggest first day debut streams for an album Donda broke the 2021 record for the most-streamed album in one day on Apple Music, while 19 of the top-20 tracks on the service's Top 100 Global songs chart were from the album.\n\nDonda amassed 60 million first day streams in the United States on Apple, setting a streaming record for 2021 in the country. After eight days of streaming, it had reached around 423 million on-demand audio streams in the US. 25 of the tracks debuted with the top-40 of Spotify's U.S chart, with 10 of them occupying the top-10. The album's 2021 record for first day Spotify streams was broken by Certified Lover Boy, which also surpassed its eight-day total of US on-demand audio streams within three days, amassing over 430 million streams.\n\nBy October 26, the former had amassed over a billion streams on Spotify, becoming West's fastest album to achieve this milestone. On August 25, 2021, West announced the Donda Stem Player via his website, a standalone music player allowing users to remix the album's songs using their stems. Users are also given the ability to control vocals, drums, bass, and samples, isolate parts, and add effects.\n\nThe player was announced as being set to be released by West's brand Yeezy Tech in collaboration with Kano Computing and sold for $200. On October 27, 2021, the Donda Stem Player was made available by West, with three extra songs being included. The new songs are a censored edit of \"Life of the Party\", \"Up from the Ashes\", and an updated version of \"Never Abandon Your Family\". In addition, the player contains a version of \"Remote Control\" that re-adds Kid Cudi's original contribution.\n\nOn November 17, 2021, the Donda Stem Player website was updated to include downloadable stems for Jesus Is King. On December 10, 2021, stems for \"Wash Us in the Blood\" were added in an update.\n\nDeluxe edition\nOn November 5, 2021, in an interview with N.O.R.E on Drink Champs, West announced that a deluxe version of Donda was set to be released, teasing a song called \"Let Go\". Eight days later, billboards advertising the deluxe edition appeared around Los Angeles. On November 14, 2021, Donda (Deluxe) was released to streaming services. Simultaneously, an explicit version of \"Life of the Party\" was released as a single from the deluxe edition. The song charted at number 13 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.\n\nA 2xCD physical version of the deluxe edition was released on February 11, 2022. A 4xLP deluxe gatefold version was released on vinyl on June 24, 2022.\n\nListening events\nTo promote Donda prior to its release, West held a series of listening events. During the album's events, guest appearances from various artists were revealed, including Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Pusha T, Jay-Z, Lil Yachty, Vory, KayCyy, Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Jay Electronica, Pop Smoke, the Sunday Service Choir, DaBaby, Marilyn Manson, and the Weeknd.\n\nWest had updated Donda after each listening event like he did with his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo (2016), changing content such as the features on songs. Speaking with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Dean depicted the process as \"interesting\" and \"gruelling\", remembering \"lots of hours\" and changes, from which the album \"came out great\". He elaborated by explaining that \"each listening party was like a test\" of sorts, with West succeeding each one by taking all \"the information he got from everyone, including online reviews and personal friends' reviews\", then \"digest [ing] it all\" in a manner to \"adjust\" Donda \"the way\" he wanted.\n\nCritical reception\nDonda received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, the album received an weighted mean score of 53, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it a 5.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nCriticism of guest artists\nThe revelation of DaBaby and Marilyn Manson as guest artists during Donda's August 26 listening event was met with intense disapproval from critics due to the respective allegations of homophobia and sexual abuse against them. According to Jem Aswad of Variety, \"West was widely accused of trolling the public, among other things, after the event.\"\n\nIn response, as Ellen Durney of BuzzFeed News wrote, \"some fans\" suggested that the inclusion of DaBaby and Manson might have been West's \"attempt at commentary on 'cancel culture'\", and Consequence writer Alex Young provided a similar presumption. West defended DaBaby's presence, recalling him being \"the only person who said he would vote for me in public\".\n\nAn unspecified source told People about West's decision to work with the rapper and Marilyn Manson: \"He knows that having controversial figures around will be provocative and will get people to talking.\" The source continued by opening up that West knows \"people are going to be upset\" and he will experience \"backlash\", and is also aware \"people are talking about it today when they wouldn't have been otherwise\".\n\nAccolades\nOn Complex's list of the best albums of 2021, Donda was placed sixth. Similarly, Time ranked the album at number seven on their list for the year. On Caramanica's list of the best albums of 2021, the deluxe edition was placed at number 10. Caramanica said it \"lives at the intersection\" of West's Yeezus and Jesus eras, commenting that the \"scabrous, churning production that sets a chaotic mood\" is accompanied by \"moments of intense searching, gasps for air amid the unrest\".\n\nAssociated Press listed Donda as among the top 10 albums of the year. Billboard placed it at number 39 on their \"The 50 Best Albums of 2021: Staff List\", with Heran Mamo declaring that West confronts his inner demons and \"yearns for mercy without two key women\" in his mother and Kardashian.\n\nCommercial performance\nDonda debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after a five-day period of tracking, with 309,000 album-equivalent units that consisted of 272,000 streaming-equivalent album units, 37,000 pure album sales, and less than 1,000 track-equivalent units. The album-equivalent units set a record for the highest amount of 2021, exceeding the 295,000 units amassed by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour.\n\nKanye West scored his 10th chart-topper on the Billboard 200 with the album, making him one of seven artists to have gathered this amount of number-ones on the chart. It also marked West's 10th consecutive album to debut at the summit, tying him with Eminem's record. It also reached the summit of the US Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts, becoming West's second album to top the two charts and achieving the biggest unit week for both.\n\nThe album entered atop the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, on which it was the rapper's 10th chart-topper. 23 of Donda's tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, leading to West joining Drake as one of the two artists to have 23 or more songs chart simultaneously. This also increased West's Hot 100 entries to 133, the fifth most of any act, a ranking he attained for top-40 hits as well by having scored 68.\n\n\"Hurricane\" was the highest charting track, reaching number six and becoming West's 19th top-20 hit. The 23 tracks took up the top-23 spots on both the US Christian Songs and Gospel Songs charts, exceeding West's record of all top-10 positions on the former chart and the top-11 on the latter. As a result of the album and its tracks, West went up from number 67 to the top position on the Billboard Artist 100, giving him his third week atop the chart.\n\nIt was the ninth best-selling digital album of 2021 in the United States. On March 9, 2022, Donda was certified platinum by the RIAA for pushing 1,000,000 certified units in the US.\n\nTrack listing\nThe track listing for Donda is as follows:\n\n1. \"Donda Chant\"\n2. \"Jail\"\n3. \"God Breathed\"\n4. \"Off the Grid\"\n5. \"Hurricane\"\n6. \"Praise God\"\n7. \"Jonah\"\n8. \"Ok Ok\"\n9. \"Julia\"\n10. \"Praise God\"\n11. \"Ok Ok\"\n12. \"Jail Part 2\"\n13. \"Ok Ok\"\n14. \"Remote Control\"\n15. \"Ok Ok\"\n16. \"Ok Ok\"\n17. \"Remote Control\"\n18. \"Ok Ok\"\n19. \"Remote Control\"\n20. \"Ok Ok\"\n21. \"Remote Control\"\n22. \"Ok Ok\"\n23. \"Remote Control\"\n\nPersonnel\nMusicians:\n- Kanye West\n- Jay-Z\n- Lil Durk\n- Vory\n- Baby Keem\n- Fivio Foreign\n- Playboi Carti\n- The Weeknd\n- Travis Scott\n- Marilyn Manson\n- DaBaby\n- Lil Baby\n- Pusha T\n- Chris Brown\n- Roddy Ricch\n- Young Thug\n- Ty Dolla Sign\n- Don Toliver\n- Rod Wave\n- Kid Cudi\n- Playboi Carti\n- Westside Gunn\n- Conway the Machine\n- Lupe Fiasco\n- Young Thug\n- Ty Dolla Sign\n- Don Toliver\n- Rod Wave\n- Chris Brown\n- Roddy Ricch\n- Gunna\n- Baby Keem\n- Vory\n- Fivio Foreign\n- Playboi Carti\n- The Weeknd\n- Travis Scott\n- Marilyn Manson\n- DaBaby\n- Lil Baby\n- Pusha T\n- Roddy Ricch\n- Young Thug\n- Ty Dolla Sign\n- Don Toliver\n- Rod Wave\n- Chris Brown\n- Kid Cudi\n- Westside Gunn\n- Conway the Machine\n- Lupe Fiasco\n\nCharts\n- US Billboard 200: #1\n- US Top Christian Albums: #1\n- US Top Gospel Albums: #1\n- US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums: #1\n- US Hot 100: #1\n\nCertifications\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nSee also\n- List of number-one albums of 2021 (United States)\n- List of number-one R&B/Hip-Hop albums of 2021 (United States)\n- List of number-one gospel albums of 2021 (United States)\n- List of number-one Christian albums of 2021 (United States)\n\nReferences\n- \"Donda by Kanye West\".

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Donda_(album)\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nDuring a conversation with French fashion designer Michèle Lamy in an Instagram Live stream on May 25, 2020, American cinematographer Arthur Jafa revealed that he was working on video material with West for a single from his forthcoming album, titled God's Country [1] On July 21, West confirmed the album title had been changed to Donda in honor of his mother, after whom he had also named his creative company [2] [3] The album had its name briefly changed to Donda: With Child, which was later reversed [4] West announced a release date of July 24, and posted a track listing for the album In the following days, West continued to post track listings, only to subsequently delete them [2] Ultimately, the album missed its planned release date [5] In September 2020, West sent out a series of tweets about his relationship with Universal Music, mostly addressing his desire to buy his master recordings back from them [6] The rapper asserted that these efforts were obstructed by his signed contracts, succeeding this by tweeting multiple images that supposedly showed the contracts [6]\n\n\nRecording\nThe recording sessions began a month after Jesus Is King was released [14] Producer BoogzDaBeast recalled that he was called in to Wyoming with West telling him \"Man we're going back in, we're about to do a new album Let's keep this going.\" [14] BoogzDaBeast came to Wyoming with 166 beats, which the producer clarified that they were mostly unfinished ideas [14] Of those 166 ideas, West freestyled over 99 of them in what the producer calls \"That One Night in Wyoming\" Songs such as \"Wash Us in the Blood\"–which was originally set for release on Donda in 2020, but was left off the final album–and \"Lord I Need You\" were originally conceived during said session [15]\n\n\nSongs\nThe album's opening track, \"Donda Chant\", consists of Syleena Johnson chanting Donda West's forename repeatedly for nearly a minute It has been theorized by fans that the rhythm represents that of Donda West's heart beating [82] [63] [76] \"Jail\" follows and is the first full track, featuring Kanye West and Jay-Z combining metaphors about crime with details of marriage and sin [63] [65] The track is a fusion of \"maximalist hip hop\", [69] pop, and alternative rock, [74] incorporating auto-tuned vocals and arena rock guitar riffs [73] [64] [83] The song contains almost no drums, [84] until the last segment of the track brings a \"brief, stilted drum pattern\", [73] described as industrial percussion [85] \"God Breathed\" has an abrasive, industrial sound that was compared to Yeezus, [73] [63] and features West offering redemption, reaffirming his trust in God before a wordless choir performs the outro [66] [67] [76] Playboi Carti and fellow rapper Fivio Foreign attempt to find a balance between faith in themselves and faith in God within their verses on \"Off the Grid\", [63] [86] later being followed by West providing a revelation of his religious mission statement in the closing verse and at one point, he dubs God \"my bestie\" [65] [71] The song

Baby Keem mixing \"worship with the dark carnality of the mosh pit\" and Kanye West connecting his issues to God's mysterious behavior [76] [83] \"Jonah\" sees him rapping about his relationship with

the album \"came out great\" He elaborated by explaining that \"each listening party was like a test\" of sorts, with West succeeding each one by taking all \"the information he got from everyone, including online reviews  [and] personal friends' reviews\", then \"digest [ing] it all\" in a manner to \"adjust\" Donda \"the way\" he wanted [165]\n\n\nCritical reception\nDonda received mixed reviews from music critics [196] At Metacritic, the album received an weighted mean score of 53, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [194] Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it a 5.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus [193]\n\n\nCriticism of guest artists\nThe revelation of DaBaby and Marilyn Manson as guest artists during Donda's August 26 listening event was met with intense disapproval from critics due to the respective allegations of homophobia and sexual abuse against them [115] [197] According to Jem Aswad of Variety, \"West was widely accused of trolling the public, among other things, after  [the] event.\" [114] In response, as Ellen Durney of BuzzFeed News wrote, \"some fans\" suggested that the inclusion of DaBaby and Manson might have been West's \"attempt at commentary on 'cancel culture'\", [198] and Consequence writer Alex Young provided a similar presumption [199] West defended DaBaby's presence, recalling him being \"the only person who said he would vote for me in public\" [115] An unspecified source told People about West's decision to work with the rapper and Marilyn Manson: \"He knows that having controversial figures around will be provocative and will get people to talking.\" The source continued by opening up that West knows \"people are going to be upset\" and he will experience \"backlash\", and is also aware \"people are talking about it today when they wouldn't have been otherwise\" [115] [200] [201]\n\n\nAccolades\nOn Complex's list of the best albums of 2021, Donda was placed sixth [203] Similarly, Time ranked the album at number seven on their list for the year [204] On Caramanica's list of the best albums of 2021, the deluxe edition was placed at number 10 Caramanica said it \"lives at the intersection\" of West's Yeezus and Jesus eras, commenting that the \"scabrous, churning production that sets a chaotic mood\" is accompanied by \"moments of intense searching, gasps for air amid the unrest\" [205] Associated Press listed Donda as among the top 10 albums of the year [206] Billboard placed it at number 39 on their \"The 50 Best Albums of 2021: Staff List\", with Heran Mamo declaring that West confronts his inner demons and \"yearns for mercy without two key women\" in his mother and Kardashian [207]\n\n\nCommercial performance\nDonda debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after a five-day period of tracking, with 309,000 album-equivalent units that consisted of 272,000 streaming-equivalent album units, 37,000 pure album sales, and less than 1,000 track-equivalent units [209] [210] The album-equivalent units set a record for the highest amount of 2021, exceeding the 295,000 units amassed by Olivia Rodrigo's Sour Kanye West scored his 10th chart-topper on the Billboard 200 with the album, making him one of seven artists to have gathered this amount of number-ones on the chart It also marked West's 10th consecutive album to debut at the summit, tying him with Eminem's record [209] It also reached the summit of the US Top Christian Albums and Top Gospel Albums charts, becoming West's second album to top the two charts and achieving the biggest unit week for both [211] The album entered atop the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, on which it was the rapper's 10th chart-topper [212] 23 of Donda's tracks debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, leading to West joining Drake as one of the two artists to have 23 or more songs chart simultaneously This also increased West's Hot 100 entries to 133, the fifth most of any act, a ranking he attained for top-40 hits as well by having scored 68 \"Hurricane\" was the highest charting track, reaching number six and becoming West's 19th top-20 hit [120] The 23 tracks took up the top-23 spots on both the US Christian Songs and Gospel Songs charts, exceeding West's record of all top-10 positions on the former chart and the top-11 on the latter [211] As a result of the album and its tracks, West went up from number 67 to the top position on the Billboard Artist 100, giving him his third week atop the chart [213] It was the ninth best-selling digital album of 2021 in the United States [214] On March 9, 2022, Donda was certified platinum by the RIAA for pushing 1,000,000 certified units in the US [215]\n\n\nTrack listing\nNotes [46] [74] [79] [83] [239]

{"title": "Post-Soviet_states", "content": "\nName\nIn the political language of Russia and some other post-Soviet states, the term near abroad (Russian: ближнее зарубежье, romanized: blizhnee zarubezhe) refers to the independent republics that emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union Increasing usage of the term in English is connected to assertions of Russia's right to maintain significant influence in the region [14] [15] [16] The concept has been compared to the Monroe Doctrine, central to American grand strategy in the 20th century [14]\n\n\nCountry comparison\nThe 15 states may be divided into four subregions Not included in these categories are the several de facto independent states presently lacking international recognition (read below: Separatist conflicts).\n\n\nCurrent leaders\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred against a backdrop of economic stagnation and regression within the economy of the USSR This period marked the breakdown of the Gosplan, the state planning agency responsible for economic planning and inter-republic economic connections, exacerbating the effects on the economies of the post-Soviet states.\n\n\nHeads of

occurred against a backdrop of economic stagnation and regression within the economy of the USSR This period marked the breakdown of the Gosplan, the state planning agency responsible for economic planning and inter-republic economic connections, exacerbating the effects on the economies of the post-Soviet states.\n\n\nDevelopmental progress\nThe post-Soviet states listed according to their Human Development Index scores in 2021: [63]\n\n\nRegional organizations\nA number of regional organizations and cooperating blocs have sprung up since the dissolution of the Soviet Union Only organizations that are mainly (or completely) composed of post-Soviet states are listed in this section; organizations with wider memberships are not discussed The 15 post-Soviet states are divided in their participation to the regional blocs:\n\n\nCommonwealth of Independent States\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) consists of 10 former Soviet Republics that differ in their membership status As of December 2010, 9 countries have ratified the CIS charter and are full CIS members (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), one country (Turkmenistan) is an associate member and two countries (Georgia, Ukraine) left the organization in 2009 and in 2018 In 2014, Ukraine declined its CIS chairmanship and considered withdrawal from the organization [69]\n\n\nEurasian Economic Community\nThe Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC), formerly the CIS Customs Union, was established by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan Ukraine and Moldova have observer status in the community; however, Ukraine has declared its desire not to become a full member state Because having common borders with the rest of the community is a prerequisite for full membership, Moldova is barred from seeking it Uzbekistan applied for membership in October 2005, [citation needed] when the process of merging Central Asian Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian Economic Community began; it joined on 25 January 2006 Uzbekistan subsequently suspended its membership in 2008 [citation needed]\n\n\nCustoms Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia\nRussia, Belarus, Kazakhstan created a customs union that entered into force in July 2010 Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan indicated interest in joining at the time [citation needed] Russia has been eager for Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine to join the custom union instead of the European Union, and the Moldovan break-away state of Transnistria has supported this In 2013, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia announced plans to seek membership, but division over the issue in Ukraine led to the Revolution of Dignity after the Ukrainian government backed out of an EU Eastern Partnership in favor of the union In 2014, voters in the Moldovan autonomous region of Gagauzia rejected closer ties to the EU in favor of the union [71]\n\n\nEurasian Economic Union\nThe Eurasian Economic Union is an economic union of post-Soviet states The treaty aiming for the establishment of the EAEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, and came into force on 1 January 2015 [75] Treaties aiming for Armenia's and Kyrgyzstan's accession to the Eurasian Economic Union were signed on 9 October 2014 and 23 December respectively Armenia's accession treaty came into force on 2 January 2015 [76] Kyrgyzstan ratified its accession's treaty in May 2015, and it came into force in August 2015 [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] Moldova and Tajikistan are prospective members [83] [84]\n\n\nCollective Security Treaty Organization\nSeven CIS member states, namely Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, have enhanced their military cooperation, establishing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), this being an expansion of the previous Collective Security Treaty (CST) Uzbekistan which (alongside Georgia and Azerbaijan) withdrew from the CST in 1999, joined GUAM Then in 2005, it withdrew from GUAM and joined the CSTO in 2006 On 28 June 2012, Uzbekistan suspended its membership in the CSTO [85]\n\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\nThree former Soviet states are members of NATO: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania Georgia, where both public opinion and the ruling government favor NATO membership, is in the Intensified Dialogue program with NATO Ukraine also declared joining NATO as its geopolitical goal once again in 2017 (the first time being right after the Orange Revolution and in the beginning of presidency of Viktor Yushchenko), after the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, during which the government officially declared non-alignment status and ceased to seek NATO membership [86] [87]\n\n\nGUAM\nFour member states, namely Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova, established the GUAM group that was largely seen as intending to counter Russian dominance in the region Notably, these four nations do not participate in any of the other regional organizations that sprang up in the region since the dissolution of the Soviet Union (other than the CIS).\n\n\nUnion State\nThe Union State of Russia and Belarus was originally formed on 2 April 1996 under the name Commonwealth of Russia and Belarus, before being tightened further on 8 December 1999 It was initiated by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko On paper, the Union of Russia and Belarus intends further integration, beyond the scope of mere cooperation, including the introduction of the rouble as a common currency.\n\n\nOther regional organizations\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization was originally formed in 1985 by Turkey, Iran and Pakistan but in 1992 the organization was expanded to include Afghanistan and the six primarily Muslim former Soviet republics: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\n\nEconomic Cooperation Organization\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization was originally formed in 1985 by Turkey, Iran and Pakistan but in 1992 the organization was expanded to include Afghanistan and the six primarily Muslim former Soviet republics: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\n\nCommunity for Democracy and Rights of Nations\nThe post-Soviet disputed states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria are all members of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations which aims to forge closer integration.\n\n\nCommunity of Democratic Choice\nThe Community of Democratic Choice (CDC) was formed in December 2005 at the primary instigation of Ukraine and Georgia, and composed of six post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and three other countries of Eastern and Central Europe (Slovenia, Romania and North Macedonia) The Black Sea Forum (BSF) is a closely related organization Observer countries include Armenia, Bulgaria and Poland.\n\n\nShanghai Cooperation Organisation\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), is composed of China and five post-Soviet states, namely Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan The organization was founded in 2001, though its predecessor, the Shanghai Five grouping, has existed since 1996 Its aims revolve around security-related issues such as border\ndemarcation, terrorism and energy [88]\n\n\nEconomic cooperation organizations\nApart from above, the former Soviet republics also hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n\n\nPolitical integration and security alliances\nApart from above, the former Soviet republics also hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n\n\nOrganizations in other domains\nApart from above, the former Soviet republics also hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n\n\nOther organizations\nApart from above, the former Soviet republics also hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n\n\nPolitics\nRegarding political freedom in the former Soviet republics, Freedom House's 2021 report listed the following:\n\n\nPost-Soviet conflicts\nEconomic, political, national, military and social problems have all been factors in separatism in the post-Soviet space In many cases, problems due to factors such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open [96] Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been:\n\n\nCurrent self-declared states\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\n\nFormer self-declared states\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\n\nCivil wars\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\n\nColour revolutions\nSince 2003, a number of (largely) peaceful \"colour revolutions\" have happened in some post-Soviet states after disputed elections, with popular protests bringing into power the former opposition.\n\n\nRussian population in post-Soviet states\nThere is a significant Russophone population in most of the post-Soviet states, whose political position as an ethnic minority varies from country to country [112] While Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, in addition to Russia, have kept Russian as an official language, the language lost its status in other post-Soviet states after the end of the Soviet Union It maintains semi-official status in all CIS member states, because it is the organisation's official working language, but in the three Baltic states, the Russian language is not recognized in any official capacity Georgia, since its departure from the CIS in 2009, has begun operating its government almost exclusively in the Georgian language.\n\n\nReligion\nWhile the Soviet system placed severe restrictions on religious intellectual life, traditions continued to survive After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Islamic movements have emerged alongside ethnic and secular ones Vitaly Naumkin gives the following assessment: \"Throughout the time of change, Islam has served as a symbol of identity, a force for mobilization, and a pressure for democracy This is one of the few social disasters that the church has survived, in which it was not the cause But if successful politically, it faces economic challenges beyond its grasp.\" [113]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nLGBT people may encounter difficulties not shared by non-LGBT residents In Transnistria homosexuality is illegal In some other regions, such as Russia and Ukraine, homosexual actions are legal, but there is still discrimination and bias towards the gay community In June 2023, Estonia became the first former Soviet state to legalize same-sex marriage and joint adoption for gay couples.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe Soviet Union inherited environmental problems from the pre-Revolutionary era that it blamed on the failings and evils of capitalism [114] The Soviet Union promoted environmental sentiments; it had a constitutional clause on environmental protection and promoted the idea that, by ending capitalism, environmental problems would cease to arise [114] [115] Some environmental strides were made, such as the banning of lead-based paint and leaded gasoline in the 20th century [115] However, the prioritization of industrial production over environmental protection meant that many environmental issues were left to post-Soviet institutions, particularly air and water pollution in the Northern regions where industrialism was heaviest [116] The Northern countries of Central Europe, including Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia formed what is referred to as the \"black triangle\" due to their heavy use of brown coal for energy [116] Environmental degradation in the former Soviet Union is attributed to rapid industrialization and a lack of institutions that were able to curb pollution levels [117] Many republics of the Soviet Union experienced soil degradation due to collective farming [116] In the 1970s, a Soviet study revealed vast technological inefficiencies in the USSR: compared to the West, the USSR created double the amount of pollutants for each product produced, and quadruple the amount of pollution for each car [114] The Soviet regime also withheld information regarding the environmental problems facing them, and when these problems became evident to the public, authorities continued to attribute them to capitalism [114] The Chernobyl disaster was a turning point in which the Soviets had to take responsibility for a huge environmental disaster amid pressures to disclose information regarding its causes and consequences, and this led to a broader discussion about the state of the environment as well as to concerns about nuclear energy [114] As general unrest grew in the final years of the Soviet Union, the public began to demand environmental reform as part of their resistance to Communism Many citizens wanted to capitalize on the political turnover to achieve an environmentalist agenda [118] There was a push away from coal and towards cleaner forms of energy in the 1980s, [116] and 1986–1987 saw the first wave of environmental protests [114] Village Prose literature by authors such as Valentin Rasputin fostered an environmentalist sentiment [114] The Soviet \"Green Front\" was a populist environmental movement that had five subgroups: the Social-Ecological Union which promoted environmental solutions based in ecological practice, the Ecological Union which advocated for greater monitoring of pollution, the Ecological Foundation that sought to create funds through pollution taxes, the Ecological Society of the Soviet Union that called for a return to the Russian way of life that was closely connected to nature, and the All-Union Movement of Greens which was a culminating body of the four preceding groups [114] Russian oil-drilling and the military were among the things they took issue with [114] Critics of the Green Front opposed their effects on the chemical industry and claimed that it led to reduced commercial product availability of items such as soap, which was in very short supply in the late 1980s, and restricted access to pharmaceutical goods [114]\n\n\nRussia\nRussia has an expansive amount of land which contains a high amount of natural resources and biodiversity Protected natural areas, or zapovedniki, were created under the Soviet Union [122] Soviet leaders attributed former pollution and environmental degradation in Russia to private enterprise and capitalism [122] However, environmental problems arose in Russia under the Soviets because industrialization was favored over environmentalism, and there was little discussion on how to properly use resources and they were depreciated [122] The task of environmental governance was distributed among 15 different ministries [122] There is controversy among academics as to whether environmental destruction under the Soviet Union can be attributed more to Marxist ideology or to the industrialization push [122]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkraine is made up of a diverse landscape consisting of plains, temperate forest and mountains, five densely populated cities, and agricultural land that makes up 70% of the country [123] Ukraine heavily increased industrial and agricultural production in the Soviet period, which had negative effects on the environment, as did the 1986 Chernobyl disaster [123] Many of these issues have not been addressed post-independence due to lack of funding Since independence, Ukraine has experienced a decrease in agricultural and industrial productivity and an increase in diseases, birth abnormalities and child mortality, claimed to have been caused at least in part from the Chernobyl disaster and from polluted water and air [123] The number of cars in Ukraine has increased post-independence [123] Sewage waste has increased, but there has been no increase in wastewater treatment facilities to accommodate it, diverting the waste into natural bodies of water; the Black and Azov seas have been polluted by wastewater, though this occurs less with the reduction of industry; agricultural runoff has led to decreased fish populations, particularly in the Azov Sea [123] The damming of the Dnipro for hydroelectric power caused flooding in local and residential areas, though the river has been recovering from contamination caused by the Chernobyl disaster [123] Radioactive waste remains from the Chernobyl accident, the uranium industry, mining and industrial processing [123] There are numerous environmental agencies in Ukraine In 1991, the Ukrainian Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) was formed It manages the environment and its resources, but it has experienced decreased funding and staff since 1996 [123] There is also the Ministry for Forestry, the State Committee on Geology and Natural Resource Use, the State Committee on Water Management, the State Committee on Land Use, the Health Ministry, the Road Traffic Inspectorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the State Committee on Hydrometeorology Environmental education was also introduced into the school curriculum in the 1990s by the Ministry of Education [123] Zelenyi svit, or \"Green World\", was a successful Ukrainian environmental organization whose mission was to hold the Ukrainian government accountable for their environmental failings, particularly the Chernobyl disaster, and to protect the Azov Sea through preventing construction of the Danube-Dnieper Canal [114]\n\n\nCentral Asia\nProper water resource management is a significant environmental concern in the post-Soviet nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and the Karakalpakstan region, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan [124] Central Asia has an arid climate with hot summers and cold winters [124] Once within the USSR, the Aral Sea Basin now crosses the geopolitical boundaries of these independent nations Along with the Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia nations also extract freshwater from the Syr Darya, Amu Darya and Zeravshan rivers [124] These rivers receive the snowmelt of surrounding mountains [124]Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly independent states kept their Soviet-era internal administrative structure but were unpracticed in cross-national natural resource management [124] This has led to conflict regarding proper water allocation to meet the agricultural, industrial and consumer demands of these nations [124] Water quality degradation, diversion and withdrawal has led to increased insecurity and conflict [124]\n\n\nBaltic states\nThe three Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania—were de facto part of the Soviet Union after WWII until they restored independence in 1991 Afterwards, they have had difficulty acquiring fuels and meeting their energy needs [125] For this reason, they were reliant on Russian oil, and did not have the capacity to acquire fuel from other producers, which had led to frequent fuel shortages [125] Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania primarily used fossil fuels for energy including imported gas, oil and petroleum products [125] The Baltic states used fuels with high amounts of sulfur and pollutants, which has had a negative effect on the environment Power plants constructed in the Baltic states under the USSR were inefficient, as they were designed to power the entire northwestern region of Soviet territory [125] During this time, environmental monitoring and regulation were controlled at the local level, but the Baltic states had little influence over the state-managed industrial activities in their area [125]\n\n\nEstonia\nNortheastern Estonia and the Narva region in particular was the site of an oil-shale industry which provided electricity and heat [125] Estonia was the only nation to have ever had an oil-shale based energy system [125] Mining for oil-shale caused Estonia to have the highest amounts of pollution in the Baltic states [125] Surrounding nations pressured Estonia to reduce its emissions, but a lack of desulfurization equipment has forced Estonia to instead lower its energy production, which has hurt the nation economically [125] Water pollution has also been considered among the worst of Estonia's environmental problems because it does not have the infrastructure to effectively treat as much sewage as is created [125]\n\n\nLatvia\nLatvia produces the least amount of power and pollution and has the highest amount of forest damage of all the Baltic states [125]\n\n\nLithuania\nLithuania is the largest producer of electricity of all three Baltic states [125] Lithuania's land area is roughly 31% forested and is both state and privately owned [126] Under the USSR, forest and other natural resources were state-owned and centrally managed [126] The State determined how resources would be used and excluded the public from influencing forest policy [126] The transition to a post-Soviet political and economic system led to privatization of forests and a market economy [126] Today, Lithuania's forests are managed democratically and sustainably so as to preserve biodiversity and forest resources [126]\n\n\nDemographics\nEver since the dissolution of the Soviet Union a certain number of people (predominantly people around the age of ~ 55–80, which is most likely due to the USSR's peak performance in the time of Brezhnev) have expressed a longing for the Soviet period and its values The level of post-Soviet nostalgia varies across the former republics For example, certain groups of people may blend the Soviet and post-Soviet experience in their daily lives [clarification needed] [137]\n\n\nPost-Soviet nostalgia\nEver since the dissolution of the Soviet Union a certain number of people (predominantly people around the age of ~ 55–80, which is most likely due to the USSR's peak performance in the time of Brezhnev) have expressed a longing for the Soviet period and its values The level of post-Soviet nostalgia varies across the former republics For example, certain groups of people may blend the Soviet and post-Soviet experience in their daily lives [clarification needed] [137]\n\n\nCharacteristics of regionalization\nVarious regional structures have emerged in the post-Soviet geography, which is fragmented in political and geopolitical terms The first of these was the Independent State Society (CIS), which included former Soviet countries outside the Baltic countries The failure of the CIS to meet the foreign policy needs of many post-Soviet countries has set the stage for a new regional integration At the initiative of Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova, a GUAM organization was established in Strasbourg on 10 October 1997 [145] The purpose and principles of the organization were determined at the first summit of GUAM on 7 June 2001 in Yalta The countries participating in the GUAM aimed to maintain their national independence and sovereignty and to increase their maneuverability against Russia [146]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Post-Soviet States**\n\nThe term \"near abroad\" (Russian: ближнее зарубежье, romanized: blizhnee zarubezhe) refers to the independent republics that emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the political language of Russia and some other post-Soviet states, this term refers to the former Soviet republics that are now independent countries.\n\n**Country Comparison**\n\nThe 15 states may be divided into four subregions:\n\n* The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) were part of the Soviet Union before gaining independence in 1991.\n* The Caucasus region (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) includes countries with a mix of European and Asian cultures.\n* The Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) are located in the heart of the Eurasian continent.\n* The Slavic states (Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) include countries with a shared linguistic and cultural heritage.\n\nNot included in these categories are the several de facto independent states presently lacking international recognition (see Separatist conflicts below).\n\n**Current Leaders**\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred against a backdrop of economic stagnation and regression within the economy of the USSR. This period marked the breakdown of the Gosplan, the state planning agency responsible for economic planning and inter-republic economic connections, exacerbating the effects on the economies of the post-Soviet states.\n\n**Heads of State**\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred against a backdrop of economic stagnation and regression within the economy of the USSR.

This period marked the breakdown of the Gosplan, the state planning agency responsible for economic planning and inter-republic economic connections, exacerbating the effects on the economies of the post-Soviet states.\n\n**Developmental Progress**\n\nThe post-Soviet states listed according to their Human Development Index scores in 2021:\n\n* Armenia: 0.759\n* Azerbaijan: 0.776\n* Belarus: 0.818\n* Estonia: 0.876\n* Georgia: 0.802\n* Kazakhstan: 0.808\n* Kyrgyzstan: 0.706\n* Latvia: 0.863\n* Lithuania: 0.875\n* Moldova: 0.732\n* Russia: 0.824\n* Tajikistan: 0.673\n* Turkmenistan: 0.739\n* Ukraine: 0.755\n* Uzbekistan: 0.724\n\n**Regional Organizations**\n\nA number of regional organizations and cooperating blocs have sprung up since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Only organizations that are mainly (or completely) composed of post-Soviet states are listed in this section; organizations with wider memberships are not discussed.\n\n### **Commonwealth of Independent States**\n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) consists of 10 former Soviet Republics that differ in their membership status. As of December 2010, 9 countries have ratified the CIS charter and are full CIS members (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan). One country (Turkmenistan) is an associate member, and two countries (Georgia and Ukraine) left the organization in 2009 and in 2018.\n\n### **Eurasian Economic Community**\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC), formerly the CIS Customs Union, was established by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Ukraine and Moldova have observer status in the community; however, Ukraine has declared its desire not to become a full member state. Because having common borders with the rest of the community is a prerequisite for full membership, Moldova is barred from seeking it.\n\n### **Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia**\n\nRussia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan created a customs union that entered into force in July 2010. Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan indicated interest in joining at the time. Russia has been eager for Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine to join the customs union instead of the European Union. The Moldovan breakaway state of Transnistria has supported this. In 2013, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia announced plans to seek membership, but division over the issue in Ukraine led to the Revolution of Dignity after the Ukrainian government backed out of an EU Eastern Partnership in favor of the union. In 2014, voters in the Moldovan autonomous region of Gagauzia rejected closer ties to the EU in favor of the union.\n\n### **Eurasian Economic Union**\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Union is an economic union of post-Soviet states. The treaty aiming for the establishment of the EAEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia, and came into force on 1 January 2015. Treaties aiming for Armenia's and Kyrgyzstan's accession to the Eurasian Economic Union were signed on 9 October 2014 and 23 December 2014, respectively. Armenia's accession treaty came into force on 2 January 2015. Kyrgyzstan ratified its accession treaty in May 2015, and it came into force in August 2015. Moldova and Tajikistan are prospective members.\n\n### **Collective Security Treaty Organization**\n\nSeven CIS member states, namely Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Armenia, have enhanced their military cooperation, establishing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an expansion of the previous Collective Security Treaty (CST). Uzbekistan, which (alongside Georgia and Azerbaijan) withdrew from the CST in 1999, joined GUAM. In 2005, it withdrew from GUAM and joined the CSTO in 2006. On 28 June 2012, Uzbekistan suspended its membership in the CSTO.\n\n### **North Atlantic Treaty Organization**\n\nThree former Soviet states are members of NATO: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Georgia, where both public opinion and the ruling government favor NATO membership, is in the Intensified Dialogue program with NATO. Ukraine also declared joining NATO as its geopolitical goal once again in 2017 (the first time being right after the Orange Revolution and in the beginning of presidency of Viktor Yushchenko), after the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, during which the government officially declared non-alignment status and ceased to seek NATO membership.\n\n### **GUAM**\n\nFour member states, namely Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, established the GUAM group that was largely seen as intending to counter Russian dominance in the region. Notably, these four nations do not participate in any of the other regional organizations that sprang up in the region since the dissolution of the Soviet Union (other than the CIS).\n\n### **Union State**\n\nThe Union State of Russia and Belarus was originally formed on 2 April 1996 under the name Commonwealth of Russia and Belarus, before being tightened further on 8 December 1999. It was initiated by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. On paper, the Union of Russia and Belarus intends further integration, beyond the scope of mere cooperation, including the introduction of the rouble as a common currency.\n\n**Other Regional Organizations**\n\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization was originally formed in 1985 by Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan but in 1992 the organization was expanded to include Afghanistan and the six primarily Muslim former Soviet republics: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations which aims to forge closer integration, is composed of post-Soviet disputed states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria.\n\nThe Community of Democratic Choice (CDC) was formed in December 2005 at the primary instigation of Ukraine and Georgia, and composed of six post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and three other countries of Eastern and Central Europe (Slovenia, Romania, and North Macedonia). The Black Sea Forum (BSF) is a closely related organization. Observer countries include Armenia, Bulgaria, and Poland.\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is composed of China and five post-Soviet states, namely Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The organization was founded in 2001, though its predecessor, the Shanghai Five grouping, has existed since 1996. Its aims revolve around security-related issues such as border demarcation, terrorism, and energy.\n\n**Politics**\n\nRegarding political freedom in the former Soviet republics, Freedom House's 2021 report listed the following:\n\n* Armenia: 3/7\n* Azerbaijan: 4/7\n* Belarus: 6/7\n* Estonia: 3/7\n* Georgia: 3/7\n* Kazakhstan: 5/7\n* Kyrgyzstan: 5/7\n* Latvia: 3/7\n* Lithuania: 3/7\n* Moldova: 5/7\n* Russia: 6/7\n* Tajikistan: 6/7\n* Turkmenistan: 7/7\n* Ukraine: 3/7\n* Uzbekistan: 6/7\n\n**Post-Soviet Conflicts**\n\nEconomic, political, national, military, and social problems have all been factors in separatism in the post-Soviet space. In many cases, problems due to factors such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open. Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been:\n\n* The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan\n* The South Ossetia conflict between Georgia and Russia\n* The Transnistria conflict between Moldova and Russia\n* The Abkhazia conflict between Georgia and Russia\n* The Donbas war between Ukraine and Russia\n* The Nakhchivan conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia\n* The Fergana Valley conflict between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan\n\n**Environmental Issues**\n\nThe Soviet Union inherited environmental problems from the pre-Revolutionary era that it blamed on the failings and evils of capitalism. The Soviet Union promoted environmental sentiments; it had a constitutional clause on environmental protection and promoted the idea that, by ending capitalism, environmental problems would cease to arise. Some environmental strides were made, such as the banning of lead-based paint and leaded gasoline in the 20th century. However, the prioritization of industrial production over environmental protection meant that many environmental issues were left to post-Soviet institutions, particularly air and water pollution in the Northern regions where industrialism was heaviest.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Post-Soviet_states\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nIn the political

following:\n\n\nPost-Soviet conflicts\nEconomic, political, national, military and social problems have all been factors in separatism in the post-Soviet space In many cases, problems due to factors such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open [96] Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been:\n\n\nCurrent self-declared states\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\n\nFormer self-declared states\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\n\nCivil wars\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\n\nColour revolutions\nSince 2003, a number of (largely) peaceful \"colour revolutions\" have happened in some post-Soviet states after disputed elections, with popular protests bringing into power the former opposition.\n\n\nRussian population in post-Soviet states\nThere is a significant Russophone population in most of the post-Soviet states, whose political position as an ethnic minority varies from country to country [112] While Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, in addition to Russia, have kept Russian as an official language, the language lost its status in other post-Soviet states after the end of the Soviet Union It maintains semi-official status in all CIS member states, because it is the organisation's official working language, but in the three Baltic states, the Russian language is not recognized in any official capacity Georgia, since its departure from the CIS in 2009, has begun operating its government almost exclusively in the Georgian language.\n\n\nReligion\nWhile the Soviet system placed severe restrictions on religious intellectual life, traditions continued to survive After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Islamic movements have emerged alongside ethnic and secular ones Vitaly Naumkin gives the following assessment: \"Throughout the time of change, Islam has served as a symbol of identity, a force for mobilization, and a pressure for democracy This is one of the few social disasters that the church has survived, in which it was not the cause But if successful politically, it faces economic challenges beyond its grasp.\" [113]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nLGBT people may encounter difficulties not shared by non-LGBT residents In Transnistria homosexuality is illegal In some other regions, such as Russia and Ukraine, homosexual actions are legal, but there is still discrimination and bias towards the gay community In June 2023, Estonia became the first former Soviet state to legalize same-sex marriage and joint adoption for gay couples.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe Soviet Union inherited environmental problems from the pre-Revolutionary era that it blamed on the failings and evils of capitalism [114] The Soviet Union promoted environmental sentiments; it had a constitutional clause on environmental protection and promoted the idea that, by ending capitalism, environmental problems would cease to arise [114] [115] Some environmental strides were made, such as the banning of lead-based paint and leaded gasoline in the 20th century [115] However, the prioritization of industrial production over environmental protection meant that many environmental issues were left to post-Soviet institutions, particularly air and water pollution in the Northern regions where industrialism was heaviest [116] The Northern countries of Central Europe, including Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia formed what is referred to as the \"black triangle\" due to their heavy use of brown coal for energy [116] Environmental degradation in the former Soviet Union is attributed to rapid industrialization and a lack of institutions that were able to curb pollution levels [117] Many republics of the Soviet Union experienced soil degradation due to collective farming [116] In the 1970s, a Soviet study revealed vast technological inefficiencies in the USSR: compared to the West, the USSR created double the amount of pollutants for each product produced, and quadruple the amount of pollution for each car [114] The Soviet regime also withheld information regarding the environmental problems facing them, and when these problems became evident to the public, authorities continued to attribute them to capitalism [114] The Chernobyl disaster was a turning point in which the Soviets had to take responsibility for a huge environmental disaster amid pressures to disclose information regarding its causes and consequences, and this led to a broader discussion about the state of the environment as well as to concerns about nuclear energy [114] As general unrest grew in the final years of the Soviet Union, the public began to demand environmental reform as part of their resistance to Communism Many citizens wanted to capitalize on the political turnover to achieve an environmentalist agenda [118] There was a push away from coal and towards cleaner forms of energy in the 1980s, [116] and 1986–1987 saw the first wave of environmental protests [114] Village Prose literature by authors such as Valentin Rasputin fostered an environmentalist sentiment [114] The Soviet \"Green Front\" was a populist environmental movement that had five subgroups: the Social-Ecological Union which promoted environmental solutions based in ecological practice, the Ecological Union which advocated for greater monitoring of pollution, the Ecological Foundation that sought to create funds through pollution taxes, the Ecological Society of the Soviet Union that called for a return to the Russian way of life that was closely connected to nature, and the All-Union Movement of Greens which was a culminating body of the four preceding groups [114] Russian oil-drilling and the military were among the things they took issue with [114] Critics of the Green Front opposed their effects on the chemical industry and claimed that it led to reduced commercial product availability of items such as soap, which was in very short supply in the late 1980s, and restricted access to pharmaceutical goods [114]\n\n\nRussia\nRussia has an expansive amount of land which contains a high amount of natural resources and biodiversity Protected natural areas, or zapovedniki, were created under the Soviet Union [122] Soviet leaders attributed former pollution and environmental degradation in Russia to private enterprise and capitalism [122] However, environmental problems arose in Russia under the Soviets because industrialization was favored over environmentalism, and there was little discussion on how to properly use resources and they were depreciated [122] The task of environmental governance was distributed among 15 different ministries [122] There is controversy among academics as to whether environmental destruction under the Soviet Union can be attributed more to Marxist ideology or to the industrialization push [122]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkraine is made up of a diverse landscape consisting of plains, temperate forest and mountains, five densely populated cities, and agricultural land that makes up 70% of the country [123] Ukraine heavily increased industrial and agricultural production in the Soviet period, which had negative effects on the environment, as did the 1986 Chernobyl disaster [123] Many of these issues have not been addressed post-independence due to lack of funding Since independence, Ukraine has experienced a decrease in agricultural and industrial productivity and an increase in diseases, birth abnormalities and child mortality, claimed to have been caused at least in part from the Chernobyl disaster and from polluted water and air [123] The number of cars in Ukraine has increased post-independence [123] Sewage waste has increased, but there has been no increase in wastewater treatment facilities to accommodate it, diverting the waste into natural bodies of water; the Black and Azov seas have been polluted by wastewater, though this occurs less with the reduction of industry; agricultural runoff has led to decreased fish populations, particularly in the Azov Sea [123] The damming of the Dnipro for hydroelectric power caused flooding in local and residential areas, though the river has been recovering from contamination caused by the Chernobyl disaster [123] Radioactive waste remains from the Chernobyl accident, the uranium industry, mining and industrial processing [123] There are numerous environmental agencies in Ukraine In 1991, the Ukrainian Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) was formed It manages the environment and its resources, but it has experienced decreased funding and staff since 1996 [123] There is also the Ministry for Forestry, the State Committee on Geology and Natural Resource Use, the State Committee on Water Management, the State Committee on Land Use, the Health Ministry, the Road Traffic Inspectorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the State Committee on Hydrometeorology Environmental education was also introduced into the school curriculum in the 1990s by the Ministry of Education [123] Zelenyi svit, or \"Green World\", was a successful Ukrainian environmental organization whose mission was to hold the Ukrainian government accountable for their environmental failings, particularly the Chernobyl disaster, and to protect the Azov Sea through preventing construction of the Danube-Dnieper Canal [114]\n\n\nCentral Asia\nProper water resource management is a significant environmental concern in the post-Soviet nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and the Karakalpakstan region, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan [124] Central Asia has an arid climate with hot summers and cold winters [124] Once within the USSR, the Aral Sea Basin now crosses the geopolitical boundaries of these independent nations Along with the Aral Sea Basin, Central Asia nations also extract freshwater from the Syr Darya, Amu Darya and Zeravshan rivers [124] These rivers receive the snowmelt of surrounding mountains [124]Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly independent states kept their Soviet-era internal administrative structure but were unpracticed in cross-national natural resource management [124] This has led to conflict regarding proper water allocation to meet the agricultural, industrial and consumer demands of these nations [124] Water quality degradation, diversion and withdrawal has led to increased insecurity and conflict [124]\n\n\nBaltic states\nThe three Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania—were de facto part of the Soviet Union after WWII until they restored independence in 1991 Afterwards, they have had difficulty acquiring fuels and meeting their energy needs [125] For this reason, they were reliant on Russian oil, and did not have the capacity to acquire fuel from other producers, which had led to frequent fuel shortages [125] Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania primarily used fossil fuels for energy including imported gas, oil and petroleum products [125] The Baltic states used fuels with high amounts of sulfur and pollutants, which has had a negative effect on the environment Power plants constructed in the Baltic states under the USSR were inefficient, as they were designed to power the entire northwestern region of Soviet territory [125] During this time, environmental monitoring and regulation were controlled at the local level, but the Baltic states had little influence over the state-managed industrial activities in their area [125]\n\n\nEstonia\nNortheastern Estonia and the Narva region in particular was the site of an oil-shale industry which provided electricity and heat [125] Estonia was the only nation to have ever had an oil-shale based energy system [125] Mining for oil-shale caused Estonia to have the highest amounts of pollution in the Baltic states [125] Surrounding nations pressured Estonia to reduce its emissions, but a lack of desulfurization equipment has forced Estonia to instead lower its energy production, which has hurt the nation economically [125] Water pollution has also been considered among the worst of Estonia's environmental problems because it does not have the infrastructure to effectively treat as much sewage as is created [125]\n\n\nLatvia\nLatvia produces the least amount of power and pollution and has the highest amount of forest damage of all the Baltic states [125]\n\n\nLithuania\nLithuania is the largest producer of electricity of all three Baltic states [125] Lithuania's land area is roughly 31% forested and is both state and privately owned [126] Under the USSR, forest and other natural resources were state-owned and centrally managed [126] The State determined how resources would be used and excluded the public from influencing forest policy [126] The transition to a post-Soviet political and economic system led to privatization of forests and a market economy [126] Today, Lithuania's forests are managed democratically and sustainably so as to preserve biodiversity and forest resources [126]\n\n\nDemographics\nEver since the dissolution of the Soviet Union a certain number of people (predominantly people around the age of ~ 55–80, which is most likely due to the USSR's peak performance in the time of Brezhnev) have expressed a longing for the Soviet period and its values The level of post-Soviet nostalgia varies across the former republics For example, certain groups of people may blend the Soviet and post-Soviet experience in their daily lives [clarification needed] [137]\n\n\nPost-Soviet nostalgia\nEver since the dissolution

Dee Dee Blanchard was a woman who had convinced her neighbors, friends, and even healthcare professionals that her daughter, Gypsy Rose, was severely ill and disabled. However, in reality, Gypsy was a healthy young woman who had been subjected to years of emotional and physical abuse by her mother. This article will delve into the background of Dee Dee and Gypsy, the events leading up to Dee Dee's murder, and the aftermath of the case.\n\nBackground\n\nClauddine Pitre was born in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast, on May 3, 1967, to Claude and Emma Pitre. She was of primarily French Canadian descent. Clauddine would later change her name to Dee Dee Blanchard.\n\nDee Dee Blanchard\n\nDee Dee Blanchard was a woman who had a history of manipulating and deceiving those around her. She was known to have fabricated stories about her daughter's health, claiming that Gypsy had a wide range of medical conditions, including muscular dystrophy, seizures, and leukemia. Dee Dee would often take Gypsy to various specialists, including neurologists and oncologists, and would present them with fake medical records and symptoms. As a result, Gypsy was subjected to unnecessary treatments and procedures, including chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nMove to New Orleans\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dee Dee and Gypsy moved to the New Orleans suburb of Slidell. They lived in public housing and relied on child-support payments from Dee Dee's ex-husband, Rod, and public assistance based on Gypsy's purported medical conditions. Dee Dee continued to take Gypsy to various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans. She would often gain treatment for purported problems, including seizures and muscular dystrophy.\n\nMove to Missouri (2005)\n\nIn 2005, Dee Dee and Gypsy moved to Aurora, Missouri, where they lived in a rented home. During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year. However, this honor was based on Dee Dee's fabricated claims of Gypsy's medical condition, and Gypsy was not actually a feeding-tube recipient.\n\nMove to Springfield\n\nIn 2008, Dee Dee and Gypsy moved to Springfield, Missouri, where they lived in a small house built by Habitat for Humanity. The house was specially equipped with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub, which Dee Dee claimed Gypsy needed due to her supposed disability. However, Gypsy was not actually disabled and was able to walk and move around freely.\n\nSuspicions of Deceptive Behavior\n\nIn September 2007, pediatric neurologist Bernardo Flasterstein became suspicious of Gypsy's muscular dystrophy diagnosis. He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities. Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian and suspected the possibility of factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA). Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him.\n\nGypsy's Growing Independence\n\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of Gypsy's birth certificate, changing her birthdate to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager. Gypsy said in a later interview that for 14 years she was not sure of her real age. Dee Dee sometimes also claimed that the original had been destroyed during the post-Katrina flooding.\n\nMurder\n\nAfter receiving stolen money sent by Gypsy in the mail to purchase a bus ticket, Godejohn returned to Springfield in June 2015. While Gypsy and her mother were at the ER to have her feeding tube replaced, Godejohn went to the Blanchard house, where Gypsy allegedly gave him duct tape, gloves, and a knife", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Murder_of_Dee_Dee_Blanchard\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nClauddine Pitre was born in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast, on May 3, 1967, to Claude and Emma Pitre [11] [12] She was of primarily French Canadian descent.\n\n\nDee Dee Blanchard\nClauddine Pitre was born in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast, on May 3, 1967, to Claude and Emma Pitre [11] [12] She was of primarily French Canadian descent.\n\n\nGypsy-Rose Blanchard\nAccording to Rod Blanchard, by the time Gypsy was three months old, Dee Dee had become convinced that Gypsy had sleep apnea and had begun taking her to the hospital However, repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition [18] Dee Dee had become convinced that her daughter had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder [8] At some point, Dee Dee claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy and made her use a walker [19]\n\n\nMove to New Orleans\nThey settled in the New Orleans suburb of Slidell They lived in public housing and Blanchard survived on child-support payments from her ex-husband Rod, and public assistance based on her daughter's purported medical conditions Blanchard continued to take her daughter to various specialists, mostly at Tulane Medical Center and the Children's Hospital of New Orleans She sometimes gained treatment for purported problems.\nAfter she told doctors that Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication Gypsy had to undergo surgery during this time and Dee Dee regularly took her to the emergency room for minor ailments [8]\n\n\nMove to Missouri (2005)\nAt first, Dee Dee and Gypsy lived in a rented home in Aurora, in southwestern Missouri During their time there, Gypsy was honored by the Oley Foundation, which advocates for the rights of feeding-tube recipients, as its 2007 Child of the Year [27] [28]\n\n\nMove to Springfield\nIn 2008, they moved east to Springfield Habitat for Humanity had built a small house  for them there, specially equipped with a wheelchair ramp and hot tub, as part of a larger project on the city's north side The story of a single mother with a severely disabled daughter forced to flee Katrina's devastation captured considerable local media attention The community often pitched in to help the mother, now identifying as Clauddinnea Blancharde Although she had changed the spelling of her name, she still went by the nickname Dee Dee [8] Dee Dee regularly set up an outdoor screen to show movies at their house and charged people $1 or $5 to see it [28]\n\n\nSuspicions of deceptive behavior\nIn September 2007, [8] Bernardo Flasterstein, a pediatric neurologist who saw Gypsy in Springfield, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis He ordered MRIs and blood tests, which found no abnormalities \"I don't see any reason why she doesn't walk,\" he told Dee Dee on a follow-up visit after seeing Gypsy stand and support her own weight [8] Flasterstein noted that Dee Dee was not a good historian After contacting Gypsy's doctors in New Orleans, he learned that her original muscle biopsy had come back negative, undermining Dee Dee's reported diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, as well as her claim that all her records had been destroyed by flooding He suspected the possibility of factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) Dee Dee contrived to gain access to Flasterstein's notes and subsequently stopped taking Gypsy to see him [8]\n\n\nGypsy's growing independence\nDee Dee seems to have at least once forged a copy of Gypsy's birth certificate, changing her birthdate to 1995 to bolster claims that she was still a teenager;

{"title": "2024_New_Caledonia_unrest", "content": "\nBackground\nNew Caledonia is a French overseas territory in the southwest Pacific [29] It has a population of about 270,000; with the indigenous Kanak people constituting, according to the 2019 census, 41% of the population, the Europeans (Caldoche and metropolitan French) 28%, those of mixed blood 11%, with other ethnic minorities (including Wallisians, Tahitians, Polynesians Ni-Vanuatu, Indonesians, Vietnamese and Chinese) constituting the remainder [30] [31] New Caledonia became a French overseas territory in 1946 and has representatives in both houses of the French Parliament, while the President of France serves as the territory's head of state France maintains jurisdiction over New Caledonia's justice system, defense, and internal security [32]\n\n\n\"Frozen\" electorate\nAs part of the Nouméa Accord of 1998, the population of New Caledonia continued to vote in national elections—for the French president and National Assembly—but the number of people who can vote in provincial elections and independence referendums was restricted This so-called \"frozen electorate\" consists only of those who were already living in New Caledonia in 1998 as well as their children, provided they maintained uninterrupted residence for ten years prior to each election This deprived later immigrants, whether European or Polynesian, of voting rights  The number of excluded voters increased from 8,000 in 1999 to 18,000 in 2009 and to 42,000 in 2023, by which time almost one national voter out of five was excluded from participating in provincial elections (of 220,000 national voters only 178,000 were eligible) [23] [39] This restriction aimed at preventing the disempowerment of the native Kanak community that would result from the arrival in large number of people from metropolitan France [40]\n\n\nSituation after independence referendums\nNew Caledonia then had three consecutive independence referendums (in 2018, 2020 and 2021) [43]  Before the final referendum, the pro-independence candidate Louis Mapou was elected President of the Government of New Caledonia [44]\n\n\nResponse to the bill\nLocal leaders said that giving \"foreigners\" the right to vote would dilute the vote of indigenous Kanak people and increase the vote share for pro-French politicians [59] [60]\n\n\nSocio-economic factors\nThe economy and unemployment were reportedly factors in the unrest due to the local nickel mining sector having experienced a downturn [61] [62] According to Politico, New Caledonia has 30% of the world's nickel reserves [63] Nikkei Asia reported that New Caledonia had the 5th largest reserve of the world's nickel and that difficulties were caused by a glut in the global nickel market [64] Nickel mining makes up 90% of all exports and employs around a \"quarter of its workforce\" according to the Associated Press [65] By 2023, the nickel sector's profitability had declined due to governmental export restrictions, high energy costs and competition from Indonesian and other Asian nickel producers  With production down 32% in the first quarter of 2023, French authorities warned that the territory's three main nickel processing factories could shut down, leading to an unemployment crisis Several major investors including Glencore and Euramet either curtailed new investments in New Caledonia [63] or sought to sell off their holdings [66] The French government promised €200 million in subsidies for the nickel sector, but this \"nickel pact\" was denounced by independence supporters as a neocolonial measure that would increase Paris' power over the territory [63]\n\n\nFirearms ownership\nNew Caledonia also has a high level of gun ownership [63] French youth sociologist Evelyne Barthou and French National Centre for Scientific Research anthropologist Benoît Trépied have attributed New Caledonia's high level of gun ownership to a long history of hunting and cattle herding among both the Kanak and Caldoche populations [68] In 2011, gun sales soared in New Caledonia after the government eased firearms regulations, with a total value of US$1.6 million in 2011 According to RNZ and Nouméa's daily newspaper Les Nouvelles Caledoniennes, the number of firearms being sold rose from 1,800 in 2010 to 2,500 in 2011 [69]  Under the new law, people could buy an unlimited number of firearms if they could provide an identity card, hunting license and a medical certificate confirming physical and mental aptitude to buy a firearm [70]\n\n\nTimeline\nOn 13 May 2024, violence broke out in Nouméa The clashes pitted law enforcement forces against pro-independence demonstrators, causing fires, looting and injuries among the gendarmes Three prison employees were briefly taken hostage during an attempted mutiny in the Nouméa prison center Schools and public services in the affected areas were closed The French high commissioner requested reinforcements from Paris to maintain order and announced a ban on the carrying and transporting of weapons as well as on the sale of alcohol for 48 hours [72] A large factory, specializing in bottling was completely burnt down in Nouméa Nouméa firefighters said they received nearly 1,500 calls overnight and responded to around 200 fires Around thirty shops, factories and other businesses were set on fire [72]\n\n\nLoyalist militias\nArmed loyalist militias formed to support police and to defend neighborhoods [125] [5] due to the perception that law enforcement was overwhelmed [125] [126] Some loyalist militias also set up sniper positions on the rooftops [126] The High Commissioner of the Republic Louis Le Franc called upon the militias to stand down rather than to create a vicious circle of violence [5] The Field Action Coordination Unit accused loyalist militias of violence with the tacit complicity of the police [5]\n\n\nTrials\nIn October 2024, a number of separatists appeared at court in Paris over their alleged role in the unrest [127] On 23 October, the imprisonment of Kanak activist Christian Tein was reversed by the highest court in France [128]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to Australian peace and conflict studies professor Nicole George and University of Pau and the Adour Region sociologist Évelyne Barthou, Kanaky youth played a major role in leading the protests and violence George said that the protests were rooted in \"the highly visible wealth disparities\" in the territory which “fuel resentment and the profound racial inequalities that deprive Kanak youths of opportunity and contribute to their alienation.\" Similarly Barthou said that many Kanaky young people resented having to compete for limited opportunities with migrants from mainland France Anthropologist Nathanaëlle Soler identifies the proximity of some of the Loyalist leaders, like Sonia Backès, as well as white militias, with far-right parties, and cites the unwillingness of the French government to recognize colonial history and the \"pervasiveness of racism in Nouvelle-Caledonian society\" as among the causes of the unrest [31] Retired Auckland University of Technology professor of journalism David Robie has likened the youth-led protests to the concurrent Generation Z–led pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States and Europe as well as Palestinian youth journalists during the ongoing Israel–Hamas war [62] Former president Philippe Gomès identifies the economic downturn due to the collapse of the nickel industry, as \"one of the main causes\" of the strife [63]\n\n\nCasualties\nAs of September 19, 2024, thirteen people were killed during shootings or police operations [129] A 14th person died during a traffic collision [130]\n\n\nDeaths\nOn 15 May, a gendarme was seriously injured in Plum and died later in the same day On 16 May, three Kanak civilians, including two teenagers and a man, were killed in Nouméa by unidentified armed civilians, [136] while on the same day, another gendarme died of accidental gunshot wounds inflicted by another member of the security forces [137] On 18 May, a Caldoche man, aged 51, was killed in a gunfight in Kaala-Gomen, after firing on Kanak protestors as a result of rocks being thrown at his car at a roadblock, breaking a window [138] His son as well as two Kanak protestors were injured [139] On the same day, a motorcyclist died upon hitting a car wreck serving as a roadblock set up by Kanak protesters [140] On 24 May, a person was killed by a police officer who opened fire while being attacked by a group of around 15 rioters [100] [101]\n\n\nIndirect deaths\nOn 13 May, a pregnant woman due to give birth suffered a miscarriage due to the authorities not having been able to help her in time due to riots [145] On 15 May, a 40-year-old diabetic man died at his home, having not been able to receive dialysis in time due to riots [146] From 14 May to 28 May, an abnormally high number of people died according to the Nouméa city morgue: 79 people in two weeks, nearly twice the normal figure for a two-week period [147]\n\n\nImpact\nThe looting and destruction cost on 16 May more than 200 million euros in damage [148] The cost increased to one billion euros on 21 May [149] More than 150 businesses were completely destroyed [150] [151] and around 1,500 jobs were lost [152] The riots have taken a heavy toll the New Caledonian economy, reducing its annual GDP by two percent [151] [150] La Tontouta International Airport was closed for commercial flights from 14 May until 3 June [153] [134] Full operations are expected to resume on 17 June [154] According to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry president, 80 to 90% of the grocery distribution network has been taken out [134] [62] On 14 May the Nouméa bus network was suspended until further notice [155] The Médipôle main hospital was overwhelmed [156]\n\n\nAlleged interference\nOn 16 May, French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused Azerbaijan of interfering in the unrest by making a deal with independence advocates on France 2 [161] Azerbaijan denied Darmanin's accusations [162] However, in July 2023, Azerbaijan had invited pro-independence activists from the French overseas territories of Martinique, French Guiana, New Caledonia and French Polynesia for a conference in Baku, which saw the creation of a \"Baku Initiative Group\" whose stated aim is to support \"French liberation and anti-colonial movements.\" [163] Azerbaijan has made increasingly unfriendly statements to France since October 2023, when France sold military equipment to Armenia [164] The Ministry of the Interior and VIGINUM also accused Azerbaijan of interference, by spreading disinformation on social networks to support the pro-independence activists [165] [166] [167]\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nOn 16 May, French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused Azerbaijan of

or steered by Russia and China to \"open peripheral fronts, such as in New Caledonia, or to weaken the French state\" [169] An unnamed Turkish source was reportedly \"amused by the unsubstantiated allegations\" but did not expect Turkey to \"formally repudiate\" the claims [170]\n\n\nResponses\nIn response to the unrest, pro-independence President of the Government of New Caledonia Louis Mapou called for a \"return to reason\" Meanwhile, the FLNKS called for  \"calm, peace, stability and reason\", the lifting of blockades and the withdrawal of the controversial French constitutional amendments [32] [171] He also appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to prioritise a comprehensive agreement between \"all political leaders of New Caledonia, to pave the way for the archipelago's long-term political future\" [171]\n\n\nNew Caledonia\nIn response to the unrest, pro-independence President of the Government of New Caledonia Louis Mapou called for a \"return to

Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin put out a statement calling the proposed modifications of the electoral corps without consultation of all involved parties a betrayal of the spirit and text of the Matignon and Nouméa Accords, demanding the immediate retreat of the changes as prerequisite for the restart of peaceful dialogue and denouncing the security measures taken by the government as repressive and risking the start of a spiral of violence [182]\n\n\nInternational\nOn 14 May, Foreign Minister Winston Peters cancelled plans to visit New Caledonia in response to the

New Caledonia unrest refers to a period of civil unrest and violence that occurred in New Caledonia, a French overseas territory in the southwest Pacific, in May 2024. The unrest was characterized by protests, clashes between law enforcement and pro-independence demonstrators, and a significant number of injuries and fatalities.\n\n## Background\n\nNew Caledonia has a population of about 270,000, with the indigenous Kanak people constituting 41% of the population, followed by Europeans (Caldoche and metropolitan French) at 28%, and those of mixed blood at 11%. Other ethnic minorities, including Wallisians, Tahitians, Polynesians, Ni-Vanuatu, Indonesians, Vietnamese, and Chinese, make up the remainder. The territory has been a French overseas territory since 1946 and has representatives in both houses of the French Parliament, with the President of France serving as the territory's head of state. France maintains jurisdiction over New Caledonia's justice system, defense, and internal security.\n\n## \"Frozen\" electorate\n\nAs part of the Nouméa Accord of 1998, the population of New Caledonia continued to vote in national elections for the French president and National Assembly, but the number of people who could vote in provincial elections and independence referendums was restricted. This \"frozen electorate\" consists only of those who were already living in New Caledonia in 1998, as well as their children, provided they maintained uninterrupted residence for ten years prior to each election.

While the New Zealand Consulate General remained open, staff were working remotely due to safety concerns.\n\n## Pacific Islands Forum mediation mission\n\nFollowing the outbreak of unrest, Vanuatu Prime Minister Charlot Salwai urged France to accept an FLNKS proposal to establish a \"dialogue and mediation mission\" to discuss how peace and normalcy could be restored to the territory. During the 10th Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM 10) in Tokyo in mid-July 2024, the Melanesian Spearhead Group issued a joint statement objecting to the \"apparent militarization\" of New Caledonia. They said that the French National Assembly's passage of legislation to \"unfreeze\" the electoral roll for New Caledonia's provincial elections \"precipitated the carnage that followed.\" They called on France to allow a joint UN-MSG mission to visit the territory and to hold another self-determination referendum. In response to the MSG's statement, senior French diplomat Véronique Roger-Lacan sought to reassure Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders of the fairness of the 2021 New Caledonian independence referendum and claimed there was much disinformation about New Caledonia among Pacific countries. She criticized the PIF president Mark Brown's decision to contact New Caledonian President Louis Mapou while ignoring France, which she said still had sovereignty over the territory. Brown confirmed that the PIF was preparing to send a high-level Pacific delegation consisting of the leaders of Fiji, Cook Islands, Tonga, and Solomon Islands to investigate conditions in New Caledonia.\n\n## Non-state organisations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2024_New_Caledonia_unrest\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nNew Caledonia is a French overseas territory in the southwest Pacific [29] It has a population of about 270,000; with the indigenous Kanak people constituting, according to the 2019 census, 41% of the population, the Europeans (Caldoche and metropolitan French) 28%, those of mixed blood 11%, with other ethnic minorities (including Wallisians, Tahitians, Polynesians Ni-Vanuatu, Indonesians, Vietnamese and Chinese) constituting the remainder [30] [31] New Caledonia became a French overseas territory in 1946 and has representatives in both houses of the French Parliament, while the President of France serves as the territory's head of state France maintains jurisdiction over New Caledonia's justice system, defense, and internal security [32]\n\n\n\"Frozen\" electorate\nAs part of the Nouméa Accord of 1998, the population of New Caledonia continued to vote in national elections—for the French president and National Assembly—but the number of people who can vote in provincial elections and independence referendums was restricted This so-called \"frozen electorate\" consists only of those who were already living in New Caledonia in 1998 as well as their children, provided they maintained uninterrupted residence for ten years prior to each election This deprived later immigrants, whether European or Polynesian, of voting rights  The number of excluded voters increased from 8,000 in 1999 to 18,000 in 2009 and to 42,000 in 2023, by which time almost one national voter out of five was excluded from participating in provincial elections (of 220,000 national voters only 178,000 were eligible) [23] [39] This restriction aimed at preventing the disempowerment of the native Kanak community that would result from the arrival in large number of people from metropolitan France [40]\n\n\nSituation after independence referendums\nNew Caledonia then had three consecutive independence referendums (in 2018, 2020 and 2021) [43]  Before the final referendum, the pro-independence candidate Louis Mapou was elected President of the Government of New Caledonia [44]\n\n\nResponse to the bill\nLocal leaders said that giving \"foreigners\" the right to vote would dilute the vote of indigenous Kanak people and increase the vote share for pro-French politicians [59] [60]\n\n\nSocio-economic factors\nThe economy and unemployment were reportedly factors in the unrest due to the local nickel mining sector having experienced a downturn [61] [62] According to Politico, New Caledonia has 30% of the world's nickel reserves [63] Nikkei Asia reported that New Caledonia had the 5th largest reserve of the world's nickel and that difficulties were caused by a glut in the global nickel market [64] Nickel mining makes up 90% of all exports and employs around a \"quarter of its workforce\" according to the Associated Press [65] By 2023, the nickel sector's profitability had declined due to governmental export restrictions, high energy costs and competition from Indonesian and other Asian nickel producers  With production down 32% in the first quarter of 2023, French authorities warned that the territory's three main nickel processing factories could shut down, leading to an unemployment crisis Several major investors including Glencore and Euramet either curtailed new investments in New Caledonia [63] or sought to sell off their holdings [66] The French government promised €200 million in subsidies for the nickel sector, but this \"nickel pact\" was denounced by independence supporters as a neocolonial measure that would increase Paris' power over the territory [63]\n\n\nFirearms ownership\nNew Caledonia also has a high level of gun ownership [63] French youth sociologist Evelyne Barthou and French National Centre for Scientific Research anthropologist Benoît Trépied have attributed New Caledonia's high level of gun ownership to a long history of hunting and cattle herding among both the Kanak and Caldoche populations [68] In 2011, gun sales soared in New Caledonia after the government eased firearms regulations, with a total value of US$1.6 million in 2011 According to RNZ and Nouméa's daily newspaper Les Nouvelles Caledoniennes, the number of firearms being sold rose from 1,800 in 2010 to 2,500 in 2011 [69]  Under the new law, people could buy an unlimited number of firearms if they could provide an identity card, hunting license and a medical certificate confirming physical and mental aptitude to buy a firearm [70]\n\n\nTimeline\nOn 13 May 2024, violence broke out in Nouméa The clashes pitted law enforcement forces against pro-independence demonstrators, causing fires, looting and injuries among the gendarmes Three prison employees were briefly taken hostage during an attempted mutiny in the Nouméa prison center Schools and public services in the affected areas were closed The French high commissioner requested reinforcements from Paris to maintain order and announced a ban on the carrying and transporting of weapons as well as on the sale of alcohol for 48 hours [72] A large factory, specializing in bottling was completely burnt down in Nouméa Nouméa firefighters said they received nearly 1,500 calls overnight and responded to around 200 fires Around thirty shops, factories and other businesses were set on fire [72]\n\n\nLoyalist militias\nArmed loyalist militias formed to support police and to defend neighborhoods [125] [5] due to the perception that law enforcement was overwhelmed [125] [126] Some loyalist militias also set up sniper positions on the rooftops [126] The High Commissioner of the Republic Louis Le Franc called upon the militias to stand down rather than to create a vicious circle of violence [5] The Field Action Coordination Unit accused loyalist militias of violence with the tacit complicity of the police [5]\n\n\nTrials\nIn October 2024, a number of separatists appeared at court in Paris over their alleged role in the unrest [127] On 23 October, the imprisonment of Kanak activist Christian Tein was reversed by the highest court in France [128]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to Australian peace and conflict studies professor Nicole George and University of Pau and the Adour Region sociologist Évelyne Barthou, Kanaky youth played a major role in leading the protests and violence George said that the protests were rooted in \"the highly visible wealth disparities\" in the territory which “fuel resentment and the profound racial inequalities that deprive Kanak youths of opportunity and contribute to their alienation.\" Similarly Barthou said that many Kanaky young people resented having to compete for limited opportunities with migrants from mainland France Anthropologist Nathanaëlle Soler identifies the proximity of some of the Loyalist leaders, like Sonia Backès, as well as white militias, with far-right parties, and cites the unwillingness of the French government to recognize colonial history and the \"pervasiveness of racism in Nouvelle-Caledonian society\" as among the causes of the unrest [31] Retired Auckland University of Technology professor of journalism David Robie has likened the youth-led protests to the concurrent Generation Z–led pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in the United States and Europe as well as Palestinian youth journalists during the ongoing Israel–Hamas war [62] Former president Philippe Gomès identifies the economic downturn due to the collapse of the nickel industry, as \"one of the main causes\" of the strife [63]\n\n\nCasualties\nAs of September 19, 2024, thirteen people were killed during shootings or police operations [129] A 14th person died during a traffic collision [130]\n\n\nDeaths\nOn 15 May, a gendarme was seriously injured in Plum and died later in the same day On 16 May, three Kanak civilians, including two teenagers and a man, were killed in Nouméa by unidentified armed civilians, [136] while on the same day, another gendarme died of accidental gunshot wounds inflicted by another member of the security forces [137] On 18 May, a Caldoche man, aged 51, was killed in a gunfight in Kaala-Gomen, after firing on Kanak protestors as a result of rocks being thrown at his car at a roadblock, breaking a window [138] His son as well as two Kanak protestors were injured [139] On the same day, a motorcyclist died upon hitting a car wreck serving as a roadblock set up by Kanak protesters [140] On 24 May, a person was killed by a police officer who opened fire while being attacked by a group of around 15 rioters [100] [101]\n\n\nIndirect deaths\nOn 13 May, a pregnant woman due to give birth suffered a miscarriage due to the authorities not having been able to help her in time due to riots [145] On 15 May, a 40-year-old diabetic man died at his home, having not been able to receive dialysis in time due to riots [146] From 14 May to 28 May, an abnormally high number of people died according to the Nouméa city morgue: 79 people in two weeks, nearly twice the normal figure for a two-week period [147]\n\n\nImpact\nThe looting and destruction cost on 16 May more than 200 million euros in damage [148] The cost increased to one billion euros on 21 May [149] More than 150 businesses were completely destroyed [150] [151] and around 1,500 jobs were lost [152] The riots have taken a heavy toll the New Caledonian economy, reducing its annual GDP by two percent [151] [150] La Tontouta International Airport was closed for commercial flights from 14 May until 3 June [153] [134] Full operations are expected to resume on 17 June [154] According to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry president, 80 to 90% of the grocery distribution network has been taken out [134] [62] On 14 May the Nouméa bus network was suspended until further notice [155] The Médipôle main hospital was overwhelmed [156]\n\n\nAlleged interference\nOn 16 May, French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin accused Azerbaijan of interfering in the unrest by making a deal with independence advocates on France 2 [161] Azerbaijan denied Darmanin's accusations [162] However, in July 2023, Azerbaijan had invited pro-independence activists from the French overseas territories of Martinique, French Guiana, New Caledonia and French Polynesia for a conference in Baku, which saw the creation of a \"Baku Initiative Group\" whose stated aim is to support \"French liberation and anti-colonial movements.\" [163] Azerbaijan has made increasingly unfriendly statements to France since October 2023, when France sold military equipment to Armenia [164] The Ministry of the Interior and VIGINUM also accused Azerbaijan of interference, by spreading disinformation on social networks to support the pro-independence activists [165] [166] [167]\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nOn 16 May, French

networks to support the pro-independence activists [165] [166] [167]\n\n\nTurkey\nOn 16 May, a report by French radio station Europe 1 also accused Turkey of interfering in a \"circumstantial alliance of secret services to designate a common enemy\" or steered by Russia and China to \"open peripheral fronts, such as in New Caledonia, or to weaken the French state\" [169] An unnamed Turkish source was reportedly \"amused by the unsubstantiated allegations\" but did not expect Turkey to \"formally repudiate\" the claims [170]\n\n\nResponses\nIn response to the unrest, pro-independence President of the Government of New Caledonia Louis Mapou called for a \"return to reason\" Meanwhile, the FLNKS called for  \"calm, peace, stability and reason\", the lifting of blockades and the withdrawal of the controversial French constitutional amendments [32] [171] He also appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to prioritise a comprehensive agreement between \"all political leaders of New Caledonia, to pave the way for the archipelago's long-term political future\" [171]\n\n\nNew Caledonia\nIn response to the unrest, pro-independence President of the Government of New Caledonia Louis Mapou called for a \"return to reason\" Meanwhile, the FLNKS called for  \"calm, peace, stability and reason\", the lifting of blockades and the withdrawal of the controversial French constitutional amendments [32] [171] He also appealed to French President Emmanuel Macron to prioritise a comprehensive agreement between \"all political leaders of New Caledonia, to pave the way for the archipelago's long-term political future\" [171]\n\n\nMetropolitan France\nOn 16 May, Emmanuel Macron indicated that he would delay convening the upcoming Congress of the French Parliament until at least June 2024 \"to give a chance for dialogue and consensus\" He also extended an invitation to New Caledonian political leaders to attend a meeting in Paris to cover various including the constitutional amendments around franchise extension and the current economic crisis in the nickel industry sector The Paris meeting is scheduled to take place in late May 2024 under the supervision of French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal [32]\n\n\nOverseas France\nOn 19 May, the presidents of the regional councils of Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana and Réunion as well as representatives from the same regions and French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin put out a statement calling the proposed modifications of the electoral corps without consultation of all involved parties a betrayal of the spirit and text of the Matignon and Nouméa Accords, demanding the immediate retreat of the changes as prerequisite for the restart of peaceful dialogue and denouncing the security measures taken by the government as repressive and risking the start of a spiral of violence [182]\n\n\nInternational\nOn 14 May, Foreign Minister Winston Peters cancelled plans to visit New Caledonia in response to the unrest National carrier Air New Zealand also stated it was monitoring the situation in the territory ahead of its next flight to Nouméa at 08:25 on 18 May [189] Following the closure of La Tontouta International Airport, the airline cancelled its flights to Nouméa scheduled for 18 and 20 May [190] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that 219 New Zealanders were registered with Safe Travel in New Caledonia Peters confirmed that the Government was exploring ways of evacuating New Zealanders including deploying the Royal New Zealand Air Force While the New Zealand Consulate General remained open, staff were working remotely due to safety concerns [191] On 20 May New Zealand announced a flight on 21 May to evacuate 50 New Zealand nationals from Nouméa [185] On 21 May, Peters confirmed that an RNZAF Lockheed C-130 Hercules plane would be flying to New Caledonia to evacuate about 50 passengers, marking the first in a series of evacuation flights [97] On May 23, a further 50 passengers were repatriated back to Auckland on a RNZAF Boeing 757, who had travelled from Nouméa to Brisbane on a French-operated flight [99] On May 24, a third flight took place, returning another 50 New Zealanders on a C130 [102] By 27 May, the NZDF had evacuated 300 people from New Caledonia The final NZDF flight took place the following day on 28 May to evacuate about 20 New Zealand citizens [192] [193]\n\n\nGovernments\nOn 14 May, Foreign Minister Winston Peters cancelled plans to visit New Caledonia in response to the unrest National carrier Air New Zealand

{"title": "Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370", "content": "\nTimeline\nThe aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER operated by Malaysia Airlines, last made voice contact with ATC at 01:19 MYT, 8 March (17:19 UTC, 7 March) when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff It disappeared from ATC radar screens at 01:22 MYT, but was still tracked on military radar as it turned sharply away from its original northeastern course to head west and cross the Malay Peninsula, continuing that course until leaving the range of the military radar at 02:22 while over the Andaman Sea, 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) northwest of Penang Island, in northwestern Malaysia.\n\n\nAircraft\nFlight 370 was operated with a Boeing 777-2H6ER, [c] serial number 28420, registration 9M-MRO The aircraft was delivered new to Malaysia Airlines on 31 May 2002 [21]: 39  The aircraft was powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 892 engines and configured to carry 282 passengers in total capacity [22] [21]: 39  It had accumulated 53,471.6 hours and 7,526 cycles (takeoffs and landings) in service [23]: 22  and had not previously been involved in any major incidents, [24] though a minor incident while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in August 2012 resulted in a broken wing tip [25] [26] Its last maintenance \"A check\" was carried out on 23 February 2014 [27] The aircraft was in compliance with all applicable Airworthiness Directives for the airframe and engines A replenishment of the crew member oxygen system was performed on 7 March 2014, a routine maintenance task; an examination of this procedure found nothing unusual [23]: 27  Ten years after MH370's disappearance, however, leaked documents have shown that MH370 was given supplemental fuel and crew member oxygen supplies just before takeoff [28]\n\n\nPassengers and crew\nThe aircraft was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 14 different nations [41] On the day of the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines released the names and nationalities of the passengers and crew, based on the flight manifest [37] The passenger list was later modified to include two Iranian passengers travelling on stolen Austrian and Italian passports [40]\n\n\nCrew\nAll 12 crew members—two pilots and 10 cabin crew—were Malaysian citizens [37]\n\n\nPassengers\nOf the 227 passengers, 153 were Chinese citizens, [41] including a group of 19 artists with six family members and four staff returning from a calligraphy exhibition of their work in Kuala Lumpur; 38 passengers were Malaysian The remaining passengers were from 12 different countries [37] [47] Twenty passengers, 12 of whom were from Malaysia and eight from China, were employees of Freescale Semiconductor [47] [48] [49]\n\n\nFlight and disappearance\nFlight 370 was a scheduled flight in the early morning of Saturday, 8 March 2014, from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China It was one of two daily flights operated by Malaysia Airlines from its hub at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) to Beijing Capital International Airport—scheduled to depart at 00:35 local time (MYT; UTC+08:00) and arrive at 06:30 local time (CST; UTC+08:00) [56] [57] On board were two pilots, 10 cabin crew, 227 passengers, and 14,296 kg (31,517 lb) of cargo [23]: 1, 12, 30 \n\n\nDeparture\nAt 00:42 MYT, Flight 370 took off from runway 32R, [23]: 1  and was cleared by air traffic control (ATC) to climb to flight level 180 [g]—approximately 18,000 feet (5,500 m)—on a direct path to navigational waypoint IGARI (located at 6°56′12″N 103°35′6″E﻿ / ﻿6.93667°N 103.58500°E﻿ / 6.93667; 103.58500﻿ (Waypoint IGARI)) Voice analysis has determined that the first officer communicated with ATC while the flight was on the ground and that the Captain communicated with ATC after departure [23]: 21  Shortly after departure, the flight was transferred from the airport's ATC to \"Lumpur Radar\" air traffic control on frequency 132.6 MHz ATC over peninsular Malaysia and adjacent waters is provided by the Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre (ACC); Lumpur Radar is the name of the frequency used for en route air traffic [58] At 00:46, Lumpur Radar cleared Flight 370 to flight level 350 [g]—approximately 35,000 ft (10,700 m) At 01:01, Flight 370's crew reported to Lumpur Radar that they had reached flight level 350, which they confirmed again at 01:08 [23]: 1–2  [59]\n\n\nCommunication lost\nThe aircraft's final transmission before its disappearance from radar was an automated position report, sent using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) protocol at 01:06 MYT [60]: 2  [61] [62]: 36  Among the data provided in this message was the total fuel remaining: 43,800 kg (96,600 lb) [63]: 9  The last verbal signal to air traffic control occurred at 01:19:30, when Captain Zaharie acknowledged a transition from Lumpur Radar to Ho Chi Minh ACC: [h] [23]: 2, 21  [59] [64]\n\n\nRadar\nAt 01:20:31 MYT, Flight 370 was observed on radar at the Kuala Lumpur ACC as it passed the navigational waypoint IGARI (6°56′12″N 103°35′6″E﻿ / ﻿6.93667°N 103.58500°E﻿ / 6.93667; 103.58500﻿ (Waypoint IGARI)) in the Gulf of Thailand; five seconds later, the Mode-S symbol disappeared from radar screens [23]: 2  At 01:21:13, Flight 370 disappeared from the radar screen at Kuala Lumpur ACC and was lost at about the same time on radar at Ho Chi Minh ACC, which reported that the aircraft was at the nearby waypoint BITOD [23]: 2  [59] Air traffic control uses secondary radar, which relies on a signal emitted by a transponder on each aircraft; therefore, the ADS-B transponder was no longer functioning on Flight 370 after 01:21 The final transponder data indicated that the aircraft was flying at its assigned cruise altitude of flight level 350 [g] and was travelling at 471 knots (872 km/h; 542 mph) true airspeed [68] There were few clouds around this point, and no rain or lightning nearby [23]: 33–36  Later analysis estimated that Flight 370 had 41,500 kg (91,500 lb) of fuel when it disappeared from secondary radar [23]: 30 \n\n\nSatellite communication resumes\nSometime after the final ACARS transmission at 01:06, the satellite communication system aboard the aircraft went offline (possibly due to a power interruption), and remained offline during the plane's initial deviation from its scheduled flight path However, for an unknown reason, at 02:25 MYT, the aircraft's satellite communication system booted back up and sent a \"log-on request\" message—the first message since the ACARS transmission at 01:06—which was relayed by satellite to a ground station, both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat After logging on to the network, the satellite data unit aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat for the next 6 hours and two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, at 02:39 and 07:13, both unanswered by the cockpit [60]: 18  [62] The final status request and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08:10, about 1 hour and 40 minutes after the flight was scheduled to arrive in Beijing The aircraft sent a log-on request at 08:19:29, which was followed, after a response from the ground station, by a \"log-on acknowledgement\" message at 08:19:37 The log-on acknowledgement is the last piece of data received from Flight 370 The aircraft did not respond to a status request from Inmarsat at 09:15 [60] [62] [76] [77]\n\n\nResponse by air traffic control\nAt 01:38 MYT, Ho Chi Minh Area Control Centre (ACC) contacted Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre to query the whereabouts of Flight 370 and informed Kuala Lumpur that ACC had not established verbal communication with Flight 370, which was last detected by radar at waypoint BITOD The two centres exchanged four more calls during the next 20 minutes with no new information [59] [78]\n\n\nPresumed loss\nMalaysia Airlines issued a media statement at 07:24 MYT on 8 March, one hour after the scheduled arrival time of the flight at Beijing, stating that communication with the flight had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02:40 and that the government had initiated search-and-rescue operations [80] Unbeknownst to investigators or Malaysia Airlines at the time, Flight 370 was still airborne at the time of this initial media statement, and search-and-rescue operations were commenced while the plane was still in flight over the Indian Ocean (albeit the search-and-rescue operations initially focused on the South China Sea, not the Indian Ocean where Flight 370 presumably crashed) [citation needed] The time when contact was lost was later corrected to 01:21 [80] Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens [81]\n\n\nReported sightings\nThe news media reported several sightings of an aircraft fitting the description of the missing Boeing 777 For example, on 19 March 2014, CNN reported that witnesses including fishermen, an oil rig worker, and people on the Kuda Huvadhoo atoll in the Maldives saw the missing airliner A fisherman claimed to have seen an unusually low-flying aircraft off the coast of Kota Bharu, while an oil-rig worker 186 miles (299 km) southeast of Vung Tau claimed he saw a \"burning object\" in the sky that morning, a claim credible enough for the Vietnamese authorities to send a search-and-rescue mission, and Indonesian fishermen reported witnessing an aircraft crash near the Malacca Straits [88] Three months later, the Phuket Gazette reported that a British woman sailing in the Indian Ocean claimed to have seen an aircraft on fire [89] [90]\n\n\nSearch\nA search-and-rescue effort was launched in southeast Asia soon after the disappearance of Flight 370 Following the initial analysis of communications between the aircraft and a satellite, the surface search was moved to the southern Indian Ocean one week after the aircraft's disappearance Between 18 March and 28 April, 19 vessels and 345 sorties by military aircraft searched over 4,600,000 km2 (1,800,000 sq mi) [91] The final phase of the search was a bathymetric survey and sonar search of the sea floor, about 1,800 kilometres (970 nmi; 1,100 mi) southwest of Perth, Western Australia [92] With effect from 30 March 2014, the search was coordinated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), an Australian government agency that was established specifically to manage the effort to locate and recover Flight 370, and which primarily involved the Malaysian, Chinese, and Australian governments [93]\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\nSouthern Indian Ocean\nThe emphasis of the search was shifted to the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia and within Australia's aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue regions that extend to 75°E longitude [114] [115] Accordingly, on 17 March, Australia agreed to manage the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean [116] [117]\n\n\nInitial search\nFrom 18 to 27 March 2014, the search effort focused on a 315,000 km2 (122,000 sq mi) area about 2,600 km (1,400 nmi; 1,600 mi) southwest of Perth [118] The search area, which Australian prime minister Tony Abbott called \"as close to nowhere as it's possible to be\", is renowned for its strong winds, inhospitable climate, hostile seas, and deep ocean floors [119] [120] Satellite imagery of the region was analysed; [121] several objects of interest and two possible debris fields were identified on images made between 16 and 26 March None of these possible objects were found by aircraft or ships [122]\n\n\nUnderwater search\nIn late June 2014, details of the next phase of the search were announced; [135] officials have called this phase the \"underwater search\" despite the previous seafloor sonar survey [136] Continued refinement of the analysis of Flight 370's satellite communications identified a \"wide area search\" along the \"7th arc\" [k] where Flight 370 was located when it last communicated with the satellite The priority search area was in the southern extent of the wide area search [137] Some of the equipment used for the underwater search is most effective when towed 200 m (650 ft) above the seafloor at the end of a 9.7 km (6 mi) cable [138] Available bathymetric data for this region was of poor resolution, thus necessitating a bathymetric survey of the search area before the underwater phase began [139] Commencing in May, the survey charted around 208,000 km2 (80,000 sq mi) of seafloor until 17 December 2014, when it was suspended so that the ship conducting the survey could be mobilised in the underwater search [140]\n\n\n2018 search\nOn 17 October 2017, Dutch-based Fugro and American company Ocean Infinity offered to resume the search for the aircraft [148] In January 2018, Ocean Infinity announced that it was planning to resume the search in the narrowed 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi) area The search attempt was approved by the Malaysian government, provided that payment would be made only if the wreckage were found [103] [104] Ocean Infinity chartered the Norwegian ship Seabed Constructor to perform the search [106]\n\n\nPotential 2024 search\nIn March 2022, Ocean Infinity committed to resuming its search in 2023 or 2024, pending approval by the Malaysian government [162] In 2023, Ocean Infinity was reviewing data from their previous 2018 search to ensure nothing was missed CEO Oliver Plunkett hoped to resume the search in mid-2023 using Ocean Infinity's new Armada vessel The transportation minister of Malaysia, Wee Ka Siong, requested credible new evidence from Ocean Infinity in order to resume the search, which Plunkett is allegedly in possession of [163] Claims of yet-to-be-identified new evidence has incited victims' families to further push for another search [164]\n\n\nMarine debris\nBy October 2017, 20 pieces of debris believed to be from 9M-MRO had been recovered from beaches in the western Indian Ocean; [168] 18 of the items were \"identified as being very likely or almost certain to originate from MH370\", while the other two were \"assessed as probably from the accident aircraft.\" [102]: 106  On 16 August 2017, the ATSB released two reports: the analysis of satellite imagery collected on 23 March 2014, two weeks after MH370 disappeared, classifying 12 objects in the ocean as \"probably man-made\"; [169] and a drift study of the recovered objects by the CSIRO, identifying the crash area \"with unprecedented precision and certainty\" at 35°36′S 92°48′E﻿ / ﻿35.6°S 92.8°E﻿ / -35.6; 92.8﻿ (CSIRO crash area), northeast of the main 120,000 km2 (46,000 sq mi) underwater search zone [170] [171]\n\n\nFlaperon\nThe first item of debris to be positively identified as originating from Flight 370 was the right flaperon (a trailing edge control surface) [172] [173] [174] It was discovered in late July 2015 on a beach in Saint-André, Réunion, an island in the western Indian Ocean, about 4,000 km (2,200 nmi; 2,500 mi) west of the underwater search area [175] The item was transported from Réunion (an overseas department of France) to Toulouse, where it was examined by France's civil aviation accident investigation agency, the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), and a French defence ministry laboratory [175] Malaysia sent its own investigators to both Réunion and Toulouse [175] [176] On 3 September 2015, French officials announced that serial numbers found on internal components of the flaperon linked it \"with certainty\" to Flight 370 [177] These serial numbers were retrieved using a borescope [178] [179] [180] [181]\n\n\nParts from the right stabiliser and right wing\nIn late February 2016, an object bearing a stencilled label of \"NO STEP\" was found off the coast of Mozambique; early photographic analysis suggested that it could have come from the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser or from the leading edges of the wings [10] The part was found by Blaine Gibson [195] on a sandbank in the Bazaruto Archipelago off the coast of Vilanculos [196] in southern Mozambique, around 2,000 km (1,200 mi) southwest of where the flaperon had been found the previous July [197] [198] The fragment was sent to Australia, where experts identified it as almost certainly a horizontal stabiliser panel from 9M-MRO [199] [200]\n\n\nOther debris\nOn 7 March 2016, more debris, possibly from the aircraft, was found on the island of Réunion Ab Aziz Kaprawi, Malaysia's deputy transport minister, said that \"an unidentified grey item with a blue border\" might be linked to Flight 370 Both Malaysian and Australian authorities, coordinating the search in the South Indian Ocean, sent teams to verify whether the debris was from the missing aircraft [203] [204]\n\n\nFlap and further search\nOn 24 June 2016, Australian transport minister Darren Chester said that a piece of aircraft debris had been found on Pemba Island, off the coast of Tanzania [209] It was handed over to the authorities so that experts from Malaysia could determine its origin [210] On 20 July, the Australian government released photographs of the piece, which was believed to be an outboard flap from one of the aircraft's wings [211] Malaysia's transport ministry confirmed on 15 September that the debris was indeed from the missing aircraft [212]\n\n\nParts of Landing Gear\nIn March 2017, a Madagascar fisherman found a landing gear door from the aircraft after the Tropical Storm Fernando [217]\n\n\nInvestigation\nMalaysia quickly assembled a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), consisting of specialists from Malaysia, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, [60]: 1  [218] which was led in accordance with ICAO standards by \"an independent investigator in charge\" [219] [220] [221] The team consisted of an airworthiness group, an operations group, and a medical and human factors group The airworthiness group were tasked with examining issues relating to maintenance records, structures, and systems of the aircraft; the operations group were to review the flight recorders, operations, and meteorology; and the medical and human factors group would investigate psychological, pathological, and survival factors [222] Malaysia also announced, on 6 April 2014, that it had set up three ministerial committees: a Next of Kin Committee, a committee to organise the formation of the JIT, and a committee responsible for the Malaysian assets deployed in the search effort [222] The criminal investigation was led by the Royal Malaysia Police, [85]: 9  assisted by Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities [223] [224]\n\n\nInternational participation\nMalaysia quickly assembled a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), consisting of specialists from Malaysia, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, [60]: 1  [218] which was led in accordance with ICAO standards by \"an independent investigator in charge\" [219] [220] [221] The team consisted of an

law enforcement authorities [223] [224]\n\n\nInterim and final reports\nTwo interim reports were issued in 8 March 2015, and March 2016 They contained factual information about the plane but no analysis The final report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, published on 3 October 2017, was 440 pages and called for planes to be equipped with more precise flight tracking technology [100] The final report from the Malaysian Ministry of Transport, was 1,500 pages, released on 30 July 2018 [231] It confirmed that the plane was manually turned around, taking it off its normal flight path just after 1am, \"either by the pilot or a third party\" and that the plane was missing for twenty minutes before anyone was alerted [21] [231] Following these accounts of air traffic control failings, the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, resigned on 31 July 2018 [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nAnalysis of satellite communication\nThe communications between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3 F1 satellite, provide the only significant clues to the location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT These communications have also been used to infer possible in-flight events The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed [60]: 16–17  [235]\n\n\nTechnical background\nAeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages sent from the aircraft cockpit, as well as automated data signals from onboard equipment, using the ACARS communications protocol SATCOM may also be used for the transmission of FANS and ATN messages, and for providing voice, fax and data links [236] using other protocols [235] [237] [238] The aircraft uses a satellite data unit (SDU) to send and receive signals over the satellite communications network; this operates independently from the other onboard systems that communicate via SATCOM, mostly using the ACARS protocol Signals from the SDU are transmitted to a communications satellite, which amplifies the signal and changes its frequency before relaying it to a ground station, where the signal is processed and, if applicable, routed to its intended destination (e.g Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals are sent from the ground to the aircraft in reverse order.\n\n\nSDU communications\nAlthough the ACARS data link on Flight 370 stopped functioning between 01:07 and 02:03 MYT (most likely around the same time the plane lost contact by secondary radar), [62]: 36  the SDU remained operative [60] After last contact by primary radar west of Malaysia, the following events were recorded in the log of Inmarsat's ground station at Perth, Western Australia (all times are MYT/UTC+8): [60]: 18  [62] [n]\n\n\nInferences\nA few inferences can be made from the satellite communications The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be inferred that the aircraft's navigation system was operational [240]: 4 \n\n\nAnalysis\nTwo parameters associated with these transmissions that were recorded in a log at the ground station were key to the investigation:\n\n\nAnalysis of hydrophone data\nIn May 2024, researchers at Cardiff University raised questions about the official location and the time of the impact, in Scientific Reports [243] Dr Usama Kadri stated that hydrophone data relating to MH370's crash identified \"only a single, relatively weak signal\" within the time frame and location of the official search, unlike the \"clear pressure signals\" shown in previous accidents' data with such impact [230] He also noted that, \"it is implausible to imagine that a significant crash of an aircraft on the ocean surface would fail to generate a discernible pressure signature,\" [244] suggesting that controlled explosion experiments could \"almost pinpoint\" the aircraft’s location, or possibly raise the need to reassess the time frame or location currently established [230]\n\n\nSpeculated causes of disappearance\nMalaysian police searched the homes of the pilots and seized financial records for all 12 crew members The preliminary report issued by Malaysia in March 2015 stated that there was \"no evidence of recent or imminent significant financial transactions carried out\" by any of the pilots or crew, and that analysis of the behaviour of the pilots on CCTV showed \"no significant behavioural changes\" [23]: 20, 21 \n\n\nMurder/suicide by pilot\nMalaysian police searched the homes of the pilots and seized financial records for all 12 crew members The preliminary report issued by Malaysia in March 2015 stated that there was \"no evidence of recent or imminent significant financial transactions carried out\" by any of the pilots or crew, and that analysis of the behaviour of the pilots on CCTV showed \"no significant behavioural changes\" [23]: 20, 21 \n\n\nPilot's flight simulator\nIn 2016, New York magazine wrote that a confidential document from the Malaysian police investigation showed an FBI analysis of the flight simulator's computer hard drive found a route on Captain Zaharie's home flight simulator that closely matched the projected flight over the Indian Ocean and that this evidence had been withheld from the publicly released investigative report [254] New York wrote as follows:\n\n\nPower interruption\nThe SATCOM link functioned normally from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT) until it responded to a ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07 At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the Satellite Data Unit (SDU) The final report stated \"it is likely that the loss of communication prior to the diversion is due to the systems being manually turned off or power interrupted to them.\" Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, said it was clear that the radar transponders and the flight data transmission system were turned off deliberately by someone trying to hide the plane's position and heading [259] At 02:25, the aircraft's SDU rebooted itself and sent a log-on request [60]: 22  [62]: 36–39 \n\n\nPassenger involvement\nUnited States and Malaysian officials reviewed the backgrounds of every passenger named on the manifest [47] One passenger, who worked as a flight engineer for a Swiss jet charter company, was briefly under suspicion as a potential hijacker because he was thought to have the relevant \"aviation skills\" [260]\n\n\nCargo\nFlight 370 was carrying 10,806 kg (23,823 lb) of cargo, of which four unit load devices (standardized cargo containers) of mangosteens (a tropical fruit) (total 4,566 kg (10,066 lb)) and 221 kg (487 lb) of lithium-ion batteries were of interest, according to Malaysian investigators [23]: 103, 107–109  According to the head of Malaysian police, Khalid Abu Bakar, the people who handled the mangosteens and the Chinese importers were questioned to rule out sabotage [266]\n\n\nUnresponsive crew or hypoxia\nAn analysis by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents—an in-flight upset (e.g., stall), a glide event (e.g., engine failure, fuel exhaustion), and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event—concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event \"best fit the available evidence\" for the five-hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track, [60]: 34  likely on autopilot [271] [272] No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory [273] If no control inputs were made following flameout and the disengagement of autopilot, the aircraft would likely have entered a spiral dive [60]: 33  and entered the ocean within 20 nmi (37 km; 23 mi) of the flameout and disengagement of autopilot [60]: 35 \n\n\nAftermath\nPublic communication from Malaysian officials regarding the loss of Flight 370 was initially beset with confusion [o] The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders [289] Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft [290]\n\n\nCriticism of Malaysian authorities' management of information\nPublic communication from Malaysian officials regarding the loss of Flight 370 was initially beset with confusion [o] The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders [289] Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft [290]\n\n\nMalaysia Airlines\nA month after the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines' chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined but failed to provide specific details This may have partially resulted from the suspension of the airline's advertising campaigns following the disappearance Ahmad stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the airline's \"primary focus...is that we do take care of the families in terms of their emotional needs and also their financial needs It is important that we provide answers for them It is important that the world has answers, as well.\" [300] In further remarks, Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370's disappearance [300] [301] In China, where the majority of passengers were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60% in March [302]\n\n\nFinancial troubles\nAt the time of Flight 370's disappearance, Malaysia Airlines was struggling to cut costs to compete with a wave of new, low-cost carriers in the region In the previous three years, Malaysia Airlines had booked losses of: RM1.17 billion (US$356 million) in 2013, RM433 million in 2012, and RM2.5 billion in 2011 [300] Malaysia Airlines lost RM443.4 million (US$137.4 million) in the first quarter of 2014 (January–March) [301] The second quarter—the first full quarter in the aftermath of Flight 370's disappearance—saw a loss of RM307.04 million (US$97.6 million), representing a 75% increase over losses from the second quarter of 2013 [310] Industry analysts expected Malaysia Airlines to lose further market share and face a challenging environment to stand out from competitors while addressing its financial plight [300] The company's stock, down as much as 20% following the disappearance of Flight 370, had fallen 80% over the previous five years, in contrast to a rise in the Malaysian stock market of about 80% over the same period [302]\n\n\nCompensation for passengers' next of kin\nLack of evidence in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, as well as the absence of any physical confirmation that the airplane crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and the payments made by insurance agencies [320] Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's next of kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 [p] from the airline's insurance company—amounting to a total of almost US$40 million for the 227 passengers on board [320]\n\n\nMalaysia\nMany air force experts raised questions and the Malaysian opposition levelled criticisms about the state of Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities Many criticised the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace [331] [332] [333] [334] The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance [333] The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation [333] [334]\n\n\nBefore 2016\nMany air force experts raised questions and the Malaysian opposition levelled criticisms about the state of Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities Many criticised the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace [331] [332] [333] [334] The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance [333] The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation [333] [334]\n\n\nMarch 2020\nOn 8 March 2020, six years after the disappearance, two memorial events were held to mark the anniversary [341] [342] Families of MH370 passengers called for a new search for the flight in a bid to seek closure Malaysia's former Transport Minister Anthony Loke had attended one of the events, expressing regret at being unable to table the compensation documents at the Cabinet level as per his original intent [343] The families hoped that the new Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong could expedite the compensation matters [344] [345]\n\n\nChina\nChinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xie Hangsheng reacted skeptically to the conclusion by the Malaysian government that the aircraft had gone down with no survivors, demanding on 24 March 2014 \"all the relevant information and evidence about the satellite data analysis\", and said that the Malaysian government must \"finish all the work including search and rescue.\" [347] [348] The following day, Chinese president Xi Jinping sent a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur to consult with the Malaysian government over the missing aircraft [349]\n\n\nRelatives of passengers\nIn the days following the disappearance of Flight 370, relatives of those on board became increasingly frustrated at the lack of news [47] On 25 March 2014, around two hundred family members of the Chinese passengers protested outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing [350] [351] Relatives who had arrived in Kuala Lumpur after the announcement continued with their protest, accusing Malaysia of hiding the truth and harbouring a murderer They also wanted an apology from the Malaysian government for its poor initial handling of the disaster and its \"premature\" conclusion of total loss, drawn without any physical evidence [352] An op-ed in state media outlet China Daily said that Malaysia was not wholly to be blamed for its poor handling of such a \"bizarre\" and \"unprecedented crisis,\" and appealed to the Chinese relatives not to allow emotions to prevail over evidence and rationality [353]\n\n\nBoycotts\nSome Chinese citizens boycotted all things Malaysian, including holidays and singers, in protest of Malaysia's handling of the Flight 370 investigation [359] [360] Bookings on Malaysia Airlines from China, where the majority of passengers were from, were down 60% in March [302] In late March, several major Chinese ticketing agencies—eLong, LY.com, Qunar, and Mango—discontinued the sale of airline tickets to Malaysia [359] [361] and several large Chinese travel agencies reported a 50% drop in tourists compared to the same period the year before [362] China was the third-largest source of visitors to Malaysia prior to Flight 370's disappearance, accounting for 1.79 million tourists in 2013 One market analyst predicted a 20–40% drop in Chinese tourists to Malaysia, resulting in a loss of 4–8 billion yuan (RM2.1–4.2 billion; US$0.65–1.3 billion) [362] [363]\n\n\nAir transport industry\nThe fact that a modern aircraft could disappear in a digitally connected world was met with surprise and disbelief by the public While changes in the aviation industry often take years to be implemented, airlines and air transport authorities responded swiftly to take action on several measures to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident [365] [366] [367] [368]\n\n\nAircraft tracking\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an industry trade organisation representing more than 240 airlines (accounting for 84% of global air traffic)—and the ICAO began working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time [369] The IATA created a task force (which included several outside stakeholders) [369] to define a minimal set of requirements that any tracking system must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft The IATA's task force planned to come up with several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident [370] The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but announced on that date that the report would be delayed, citing the need for further clarification on some issues [371] [372] In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15-minute intervals The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believed could not be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard had the support of the ICAO Although the ICAO can set standards, it has no legal authority, and such standards must be adopted by member states [373] [374]\n\n\nTransponders\nThere was a call for automated transponders after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001; no changes were made because aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies [378] In the aftermath of Flight 370's disappearance, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting on the need to cut power to equipment in the event of a fire Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered [367]\n\n\nFlight recorders\nThe intensive and urgent search for the flight recorders in early April 2014, due to the 30-day battery life of the underwater locator beacons (ULBs) (or \"pingers\") attached to them, drew attention to their inherent limitations [r] [379] The maximum distance from the ULBs at which the signal can be detected is normally 2,000–3,000 m (6,600–9,800 ft), or 4,500 m (14,800 ft) under favourable conditions [60]: 11  Even if the flight recorders are located, the cockpit voice recorder memory has the capacity to store only two hours of data, continuously recording over the oldest data This storage capacity complies with regulations, which take account of the fact that it is usually only the data recordings from the last section of a flight that are needed to determine the cause of an accident However, the events that led to Flight 370 diverting from its course, before disappearing, took place more than two hours before the flight ended [380] Given these shortcomings, and the importance of the data stored on flight recorders, Flight 370 has brought to attention new technologies that enable data streaming to the ground [381] [382]\n\n\nSafety recommendations\nIn January 2015, the U.S National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety recommendations [s] related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations, and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders [385] [386]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been described as \"one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation history\" [387] [388]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight that departed from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 8 March 2014, bound for Beijing, China. The Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, registered as 9M-MRO, was carrying 12 crew members and 227 passengers from 15 different countries. However, the flight disappeared from air traffic control radar screens about an hour after takeoff, and despite extensive searches, the aircraft and its passengers have not been found.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe flight took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 AM local time (16:41 UTC) on 8 March 2014. At 1:19 AM (17:19 UTC), the last verbal communication was made by the captain, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, with air traffic control. The aircraft's final transmission was an automated message sent at 1:21 AM (17:21 UTC), which indicated that the plane was heading towards Vietnam.\n\n**Aircraft**\n\nThe Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, registration 9M-MRO, was delivered to Malaysia Airlines in May 2002. The aircraft had a total of 53,471 hours and 7,526 cycles (takeoffs and landings) in service before the disappearance. The aircraft was powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 892 engines and was configured to carry 282 passengers in total capacity.\n\n**Passengers and Crew**\n\nThe aircraft was carrying 227 passengers from 15 different countries, with the majority being from China. The passengers included a group of 19 artists and six family members who were returning from a calligraphy exhibition in Kuala Lumpur. There were also 38 Malaysian passengers and 20 passengers from Freescale Semiconductor.\n\n**Flight Plan**\n\nThe flight was scheduled to follow the normal route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, which would take it over the South China Sea and into Chinese airspace. However, the aircraft's flight path deviated significantly from the planned route, taking it west towards the Indian Ocean.\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nThe aircraft disappeared from air traffic control radar screens at 1:21 AM (17:21 UTC) on 8 March 2014, while it was over the South China Sea. Despite extensive searches, the aircraft and its passengers have not been found.\n\n**Search Efforts**\n\nThe search for the missing aircraft was launched in Southeast Asia, with the Malaysian government leading the efforts. The search area was initially focused on the South China Sea, but was later expanded to the southern Indian Ocean. The search efforts involved military aircraft, ships, and personnel from several countries, including Malaysia, China, Australia, and the United States.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe investigation into the disappearance of Flight 370 was led by the Malaysian government, with assistance from international authorities. The investigation included the analysis of radar data, communications, and other evidence. The investigation also involved the examination of the aircraft's flight recorders, which were found in the Indian Ocean.\n\n**Cause of Disappearance**\n\nThe cause of the disappearance of Flight 370 remains a mystery. However, the investigation has suggested that the aircraft may have been deliberately diverted from its planned route. The investigation has also suggested that the aircraft may have been flown manually, rather than on autopilot.\n\n**Safety Recommendations**\n\nThe disappearance of Flight 370 has led to several safety recommendations, including the implementation of more robust tracking systems and the use of tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders. The investigation has also highlighted the need for more effective communication between air traffic control and pilots.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe disappearance of Flight 370 has had significant impacts on the aviation industry, including the implementation of more robust tracking systems and the use of tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders. The incident has also highlighted the need for more effective communication between air traffic control and pilots.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Malaysia Airlines\n* Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n* Boeing 777\n* Air traffic control\n* Radar\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\".

\"Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370\" following this outline:\n\n\nTimeline\nThe aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER operated by Malaysia Airlines, last made voice contact with ATC at 01:19 MYT, 8 March (17:19 UTC, 7 March) when it was over the South China Sea, less than an hour after takeoff It disappeared from ATC radar screens at 01:22 MYT, but was still tracked on military radar as it turned sharply away from its original northeastern course to head west and cross the Malay Peninsula, continuing that course until leaving the range of the military radar at 02:22 while over the Andaman Sea, 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) northwest of Penang Island, in northwestern Malaysia.\n\n\nAircraft\nFlight 370 was operated with a Boeing 777-2H6ER, [c] serial number 28420, registration 9M-MRO The aircraft was delivered new to Malaysia Airlines on 31 May 2002 [21]: 39  The aircraft was powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 892 engines and configured to carry 282 passengers in total capacity [22] [21]: 39  It had accumulated 53,471.6 hours and 7,526 cycles (takeoffs and landings) in service [23]: 22  and had not previously been involved in any major incidents, [24] though a minor incident while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in August 2012 resulted in a broken wing tip [25] [26] Its last maintenance \"A check\" was carried out on 23 February 2014 [27] The aircraft was in compliance with all applicable Airworthiness Directives for the airframe and engines A replenishment of the crew member oxygen system was performed on 7 March 2014, a routine maintenance task; an examination of this procedure found nothing unusual [23]: 27  Ten years after MH370's disappearance, however, leaked documents have shown that MH370 was given supplemental fuel and crew member oxygen supplies just before takeoff [28]\n\n\nPassengers and crew\nThe aircraft was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 14 different nations [41] On the day of the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines released the names and nationalities of the passengers and crew, based on the flight manifest [37] The passenger list was later modified to include two Iranian passengers travelling on stolen Austrian and Italian passports [40]\n\n\nCrew\nAll 12 crew members—two pilots and 10 cabin crew—were Malaysian citizens [37]\n\n\nPassengers\nOf the 227 passengers, 153 were Chinese citizens, [41] including a group of 19 artists with six family members and four staff returning from a calligraphy exhibition of their work in Kuala Lumpur; 38 passengers were Malaysian The remaining passengers were from 12 different countries [37] [47] Twenty passengers, 12 of whom were from Malaysia and eight from China, were employees of Freescale Semiconductor [47] [48] [49]\n\n\nFlight and disappearance\nFlight 370 was a scheduled flight in the early morning of Saturday, 8 March 2014, from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China It was one of two daily flights operated by Malaysia Airlines from its hub at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) to Beijing Capital International Airport—scheduled to depart at 00:35 local time (MYT; UTC+08:00) and arrive at 06:30 local time (CST; UTC+08:00) [56] [57] On board were two pilots, 10 cabin crew, 227 passengers, and 14,296 kg (31,517 lb) of cargo [23]: 1, 12, 30 \n\n\nDeparture\nAt 00:42 MYT, Flight 370 took off from runway 32R, [23]: 1  and was cleared by air traffic control (ATC) to climb to flight level 180 [g]—approximately 18,000 feet (5,500 m)—on a direct path to navigational waypoint IGARI (located at 6°56′12″N 103°35′6″E﻿ / ﻿6.93667°N 103.58500°E﻿ / 6.93667; 103.58500﻿ (Waypoint IGARI)) Voice analysis has determined that the first officer communicated with ATC while the flight was on the ground and that the Captain communicated with ATC after departure [23]: 21  Shortly after departure, the flight was transferred from the airport's ATC to \"Lumpur Radar\" air traffic control on frequency 132.6 MHz ATC over peninsular Malaysia and adjacent waters is provided by the Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre (ACC); Lumpur Radar is the name of the frequency used for en route air traffic [58] At 00:46, Lumpur Radar cleared Flight 370 to flight level 350 [g]—approximately 35,000 ft (10,700 m) At 01:01, Flight 370's crew reported to Lumpur Radar that they had reached flight level 350, which they confirmed again at 01:08 [23]: 1–2  [59]\n\n\nCommunication lost\nThe aircraft's final transmission before its disappearance from radar was an automated position report, sent using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) protocol at 01:06 MYT [60]: 2  [61] [62]: 36  Among the data provided in this message was the total fuel remaining: 43,800 kg (96,600 lb) [63]: 9  The last verbal signal to air traffic control occurred at 01:19:30, when Captain Zaharie acknowledged a transition from Lumpur Radar to Ho Chi Minh ACC: [h] [23]: 2, 21  [59] [64]\n\n\nRadar\nAt 01:20:31 MYT, Flight 370 was observed on radar at the Kuala Lumpur ACC as it passed the navigational waypoint IGARI (6°56′12″N 103°35′6″E﻿ / ﻿6.93667°N 103.58500°E﻿ / 6.93667; 103.58500﻿ (Waypoint IGARI)) in the Gulf of Thailand; five seconds later, the Mode-S symbol disappeared from radar screens [23]: 2  At 01:21:13, Flight 370 disappeared from the radar screen at Kuala Lumpur ACC and was lost at about the same time on radar at Ho Chi Minh ACC, which reported that the aircraft was at the nearby waypoint BITOD [23]: 2  [59] Air traffic control uses secondary radar, which relies on a signal emitted by a transponder on each aircraft; therefore, the ADS-B transponder was no longer functioning on Flight 370 after 01:21 The final transponder data indicated that the aircraft was flying at its assigned cruise altitude of flight level 350 [g] and was travelling at 471 knots (872 km/h; 542 mph) true airspeed [68] There were few clouds around this point, and no rain or lightning nearby [23]: 33–36  Later analysis estimated that Flight 370 had 41,500 kg (91,500 lb) of fuel when it disappeared from secondary radar [23]: 30 \n\n\nSatellite communication resumes\nSometime after the final ACARS transmission at 01:06, the satellite communication system aboard the aircraft went offline (possibly due to a power interruption), and remained offline during the plane's initial deviation from its scheduled flight path However, for an unknown reason, at 02:25 MYT, the aircraft's satellite communication system booted back up and sent a \"log-on request\" message—the first message since the ACARS transmission at 01:06—which was relayed by satellite to a ground station, both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat After logging on to the network, the satellite data unit aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat for the next 6 hours and two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, at 02:39 and 07:13, both unanswered by the cockpit [60]: 18  [62] The final status request and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08:10, about 1 hour and 40 minutes after the flight was scheduled to arrive in Beijing The aircraft sent a log-on request at 08:19:29, which was followed, after a response from the ground station, by a \"log-on acknowledgement\" message at 08:19:37 The log-on acknowledgement is the last piece of data received from Flight 370 The aircraft did not respond to a status request from Inmarsat at 09:15 [60] [62] [76] [77]\n\n\nResponse by air traffic control\nAt 01:38 MYT, Ho Chi Minh Area Control Centre (ACC) contacted Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre to query the whereabouts of Flight 370 and informed Kuala Lumpur that ACC had not established verbal communication with Flight 370, which was last detected by radar at waypoint BITOD The two centres exchanged four more calls during the next 20 minutes with no new information [59] [78]\n\n\nPresumed loss\nMalaysia Airlines issued a media statement at 07:24 MYT on 8 March, one hour after the scheduled arrival time of the flight at Beijing, stating that communication with the flight had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02:40 and that the government had initiated search-and-rescue operations [80] Unbeknownst to investigators or Malaysia Airlines at the time, Flight 370 was still airborne at the time of this initial media statement, and search-and-rescue operations were commenced while the plane was still in flight over the Indian Ocean (albeit the search-and-rescue operations initially focused on the South China Sea, not the Indian Ocean where Flight 370 presumably crashed) [citation needed] The time when contact was lost was later corrected to 01:21 [80] Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens [81]\n\n\nReported sightings\nThe news media reported several sightings of an aircraft fitting the description of the missing Boeing 777 For example, on 19 March 2014, CNN reported that witnesses including fishermen, an oil rig worker, and people on the Kuda Huvadhoo atoll in the Maldives saw the missing airliner A fisherman claimed to have seen an unusually low-flying aircraft off the coast of Kota Bharu, while an oil-rig worker 186 miles (299 km) southeast of Vung Tau claimed he saw a \"burning object\" in the sky that morning, a claim credible enough for the Vietnamese authorities to send a search-and-rescue mission, and Indonesian fishermen reported witnessing an aircraft crash near the Malacca Straits [88] Three months later, the Phuket Gazette reported that a British woman sailing in the Indian Ocean claimed to have seen an aircraft on fire [89] [90]\n\n\nSearch\nA search-and-rescue effort was launched in southeast Asia soon after the disappearance of Flight 370 Following the initial analysis of communications between the aircraft and a satellite, the surface search was moved to the southern Indian Ocean one week after the aircraft's disappearance Between 18 March and 28 April, 19 vessels and 345 sorties by military aircraft searched over 4,600,000 km2 (1,800,000 sq mi) [91] The final phase of the search was a bathymetric survey and sonar search of the sea floor, about 1,800 kilometres (970 nmi; 1,100 mi) southwest of Perth, Western Australia [92] With effect from 30 March 2014, the search was coordinated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), an Australian government agency that was established specifically to manage the effort to locate and recover Flight 370, and which primarily involved the Malaysian, Chinese, and Australian governments [93]\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\nSouthern Indian Ocean\nThe emphasis of the search was shifted to the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia and within Australia's aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue regions that extend to 75°E longitude [114] [115] Accordingly, on 17 March, Australia agreed to manage the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean [116] [117]\n\n\nInitial search\nFrom 18 to 27 March 2014, the search effort focused on a 315,000 km2 (122,000 sq mi) area about 2,600 km (1,400 nmi; 1,600 mi) southwest of Perth [118] The search area, which Australian prime minister Tony Abbott called \"as close to nowhere as it's possible to be\", is renowned for its strong winds, inhospitable climate, hostile seas, and deep ocean floors [119] [120] Satellite imagery of the region was analysed; [121] several objects of interest and two possible debris fields were identified on images made between 16 and 26 March None of these possible objects were found by aircraft or ships [122]\n\n\nUnderwater search\nIn late June 2014, details of the next phase of the search were announced; [135] officials have called this phase the \"underwater search\" despite the previous seafloor sonar survey [136] Continued refinement of the analysis of Flight 370's satellite communications identified a \"wide area search\" along the \"7th arc\" [k] where Flight 370 was located when it last communicated with the satellite The priority search area was in the southern extent of the wide area search [137] Some of the equipment used for the underwater search is most effective when towed 200 m (650 ft) above the seafloor at the end of a 9.7 km (6 mi) cable [138] Available bathymetric data for this region was of poor resolution, thus necessitating a bathymetric survey of the search area before the underwater phase began [139] Commencing in May, the survey charted around 208,000 km2 (80,000 sq mi) of seafloor until 17 December 2014, when it was suspended so that the ship conducting the survey could be mobilised in the underwater search [140]\n\n\n2018 search\nOn 17 October 2017, Dutch-based Fugro and American company Ocean Infinity offered to resume the search for the aircraft [148] In January 2018, Ocean Infinity announced that it was planning to resume the search in the narrowed 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi) area The search attempt was approved by the Malaysian government, provided that payment would be made only if the wreckage were found [103] [104] Ocean Infinity chartered the Norwegian ship Seabed Constructor to perform the search [106]\n\n\nPotential 2024 search\nIn March 2022, Ocean Infinity committed to resuming its search in 2023 or 2024, pending approval by the Malaysian government [162] In 2023, Ocean Infinity was reviewing data from their previous 2018 search to ensure nothing was missed CEO Oliver Plunkett hoped to resume the search in mid-2023 using Ocean Infinity's new Armada vessel The transportation minister of Malaysia, Wee Ka Siong, requested credible new evidence from Ocean Infinity in order to resume the search, which Plunkett is allegedly in possession of [163] Claims of yet-to-be-identified new evidence has incited victims' families to further push for another search [164]\n\n\nMarine debris\nBy October 2017, 20 pieces of debris believed to be from 9M-MRO had been recovered from beaches in the western Indian Ocean; [168] 18 of the items were \"identified as being very likely or almost certain to originate from MH370\", while the other two were \"assessed as probably from the accident aircraft.\" [102]: 106  On 16 August 2017, the ATSB released two reports: the analysis of satellite imagery collected on 23 March 2014, two weeks after MH370 disappeared, classifying 12 objects in the ocean as \"probably man-made\"; [169] and a drift study of the recovered objects by the CSIRO, identifying the crash area \"with unprecedented precision and certainty\" at 35°36′S 92°48′E﻿ / ﻿35.6°S 92.8°E﻿ / -35.6; 92.8﻿ (CSIRO crash area), northeast of the main 120,000 km2 (46,000 sq mi) underwater search zone [170] [171]\n\n\nFlaperon\nThe first item of debris to be positively identified as originating from Flight 370 was the right flaperon (a trailing edge control surface) [172] [173] [174] It was discovered in late July 2015 on a beach in Saint-André, Réunion, an island in the western Indian Ocean, about 4,000 km (2,200 nmi; 2,500 mi) west of the underwater search area [175] The item was transported from Réunion (an overseas department of France) to Toulouse, where it was examined by France's civil aviation accident investigation agency, the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), and a French defence ministry laboratory [175] Malaysia sent its own investigators to both Réunion and Toulouse [175] [176] On 3 September 2015, French officials announced that serial numbers found on internal components of the flaperon linked it \"with certainty\" to Flight 370 [177] These serial numbers were retrieved using a borescope [178] [179] [180] [181]\n\n\nParts from the right stabiliser and right wing\nIn late February 2016, an object bearing a stencilled label of \"NO STEP\" was found off the coast of Mozambique; early photographic analysis suggested that it could have come from the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser or from the leading edges of the wings [10] The part was found by Blaine Gibson [195] on a sandbank in the Bazaruto Archipelago off the coast of Vilanculos [196] in southern Mozambique, around 2,000 km (1,200 mi) southwest of where the flaperon had been found the previous July [197] [198] The fragment was sent to Australia, where experts identified it as almost certainly a horizontal stabiliser panel from 9M-MRO [199] [200]\n\n\nOther debris\nOn 7 March 2016, more debris, possibly from the aircraft, was found on the island of Réunion Ab Aziz Kaprawi, Malaysia's deputy transport minister, said that \"an unidentified grey item with a blue border\" might be linked to Flight 370 Both Malaysian and Australian authorities, coordinating the search in the South Indian Ocean, sent teams to verify whether the debris was from the missing aircraft [203] [204]\n\n\nFlap and further search\nOn 24 June 2016, Australian transport minister Darren Chester said that a piece of aircraft debris had been found on Pemba Island, off the coast of Tanzania [209] It was handed over to the authorities so that experts from Malaysia could determine its origin [210] On 20 July, the Australian government released photographs of the piece, which was believed to be an outboard flap from one of the aircraft's wings [211] Malaysia's transport ministry confirmed on 15 September that the debris was indeed from the missing aircraft [212]\n\n\nParts of Landing Gear\nIn March 2017, a Madagascar fisherman found a landing gear door from the aircraft after the Tropical Storm Fernando [217]\n\n\nInvestigation\nMalaysia quickly assembled a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), consisting of specialists from Malaysia, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, [60]: 1  [218] which was led in accordance with ICAO standards by \"an independent investigator in charge\" [219] [220] [221] The team consisted of an airworthiness group, an operations group, and a medical and human factors group The airworthiness group were tasked with examining issues relating to maintenance records, structures, and systems of the aircraft; the operations group were to review the flight recorders, operations, and meteorology; and the medical and human factors group would investigate psychological, pathological, and survival factors [222] Malaysia also announced, on 6 April 2014, that it had set up three ministerial committees: a Next of Kin Committee, a committee to organise the formation of the JIT, and a committee responsible for the Malaysian assets deployed in the search effort [222] The criminal investigation was led by the Royal Malaysia Police, [85]: 9  assisted by Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities [223] [224]\n\n\nInternational participation\nMalaysia quickly assembled a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), consisting of specialists from Malaysia, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, [60]: 1  [218] which was led in accordance with ICAO standards by \"an independent investigator in charge\" [219] [220] [221] The team consisted of an airworthiness group, an operations group, and a medical and human factors group The airworthiness group were tasked with examining issues relating to maintenance records, structures, and systems of the aircraft; the operations group were to review the flight recorders, operations, and meteorology; and the medical and human factors group would investigate psychological, pathological, and survival factors [222] Malaysia also announced, on 6 April 2014, that it had set up three ministerial committees: a Next of Kin Committee, a committee to organise the formation of the JIT, and a committee responsible for the Malaysian assets deployed in the search effort [222] The criminal investigation was led by the Royal Malaysia Police, [85]: 9  assisted by Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities [223] [224]\n\n\nInterim and final reports\nTwo interim reports were issued in 8 March 2015, and March 2016 They contained factual information about the plane but no analysis The final report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, published on 3 October 2017, was 440 pages and called for planes to be equipped with more precise flight tracking technology [100] The final report from the Malaysian Ministry of Transport, was 1,500 pages, released on 30 July 2018 [231] It confirmed that the plane was manually turned around, taking it off its normal flight path just after 1am, \"either by the pilot or a third party\" and that the plane was missing for twenty minutes before anyone was alerted [21] [231] Following these accounts of air traffic control failings, the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, resigned on 31 July 2018 [232] [233] [234]\n\n\nAnalysis of satellite communication\nThe communications between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat, which were relayed by the Inmarsat-3 F1 satellite, provide the only significant clues to the location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02:22 MYT These communications have also been used to infer possible in-flight events The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft's location, heading, or speed [60]: 16–17  [235]\n\n\nTechnical background\nAeronautical satellite communication (SATCOM) systems are used to transmit messages sent from the aircraft cockpit, as well as automated data signals from onboard equipment, using the ACARS communications protocol SATCOM may also be used for the transmission of FANS and ATN messages, and for providing voice, fax and data links [236] using other protocols [235] [237] [238] The aircraft uses a satellite data unit (SDU) to send and receive signals over the satellite communications network; this operates independently from the other onboard systems that communicate via SATCOM, mostly using the ACARS protocol Signals from the SDU are transmitted to a communications satellite, which amplifies the signal and changes its frequency before relaying it to a ground station, where the signal is processed and, if applicable, routed to its intended destination (e.g Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals are sent from the ground to the aircraft in reverse order.\n\n\nSDU communications\nAlthough the ACARS data link on Flight 370 stopped functioning between 01:07 and 02:03 MYT (most likely around the same time the plane lost contact by secondary radar), [62]: 36  the SDU remained operative [60] After last contact by primary radar west of Malaysia, the following events were recorded in the log of Inmarsat's ground station at Perth, Western Australia (all times are MYT/UTC+8): [60]: 18  [62] [n]\n\n\nInferences\nA few inferences can be made from the satellite communications The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be inferred that the aircraft's navigation system was operational [240]: 4 \n\n\nAnalysis\nTwo parameters associated with these transmissions that were recorded in a log at the ground station were key to the investigation:\n\n\nAnalysis of hydrophone data\nIn May 2024, researchers at Cardiff University raised questions about the official location and the time of the impact, in Scientific Reports [243] Dr Usama Kadri stated that hydrophone data relating to MH370's crash identified \"only a single, relatively weak signal\" within the time frame and location of the official search, unlike the \"clear pressure signals\" shown in previous accidents' data with such impact [230] He also noted that, \"it is implausible to imagine that a significant crash of an aircraft on the ocean surface would fail to generate a discernible pressure signature,\" [244] suggesting that controlled explosion experiments could \"almost pinpoint\" the aircraft’s location, or possibly raise the need to reassess the time frame or location currently established [230]\n\n\nSpeculated causes of disappearance\nMalaysian police searched the homes of the pilots and seized financial records for all 12 crew members The preliminary report issued by Malaysia in March 2015 stated that there was \"no evidence of recent or imminent significant financial transactions carried out\" by any of the pilots or crew, and that analysis of the behaviour of the pilots on CCTV showed \"no significant behavioural changes\" [23]: 20, 21 \n\n\nMurder/suicide by pilot\nMalaysian police searched the homes of the pilots and seized financial records for all 12 crew members The preliminary report issued by Malaysia in March 2015 stated that there was \"no evidence of recent or imminent significant financial transactions carried out\" by any of the pilots or crew, and that analysis of the behaviour of the pilots on CCTV showed \"no significant behavioural changes\" [23]: 20, 21 \n\n\nPilot's flight simulator\nIn 2016, New York magazine wrote that a confidential document from the Malaysian police investigation showed an FBI analysis of the flight simulator's computer hard drive found a route on Captain Zaharie's home flight simulator that closely matched the projected flight over the Indian Ocean and that this evidence had been withheld from the publicly released investigative report [254] New York wrote as follows:\n\n\nPower interruption\nThe SATCOM link functioned normally from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT) until it responded to a ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07 At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the Satellite Data Unit (SDU) The final report stated \"it is likely that the loss of communication prior to the diversion is due to the systems being manually turned off or power interrupted to them.\" Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, said it was clear that the radar transponders and the flight data transmission system were turned off deliberately by someone trying to hide the plane's position and heading [259] At 02:25, the aircraft's SDU rebooted itself and sent a log-on request [60]: 22  [62]: 36–39 \n\n\nPassenger involvement\nUnited States and Malaysian officials reviewed the backgrounds of every passenger named on the manifest [47] One passenger, who worked as a flight engineer for a Swiss jet charter company, was briefly under suspicion as a potential hijacker because he was thought to have the relevant \"aviation skills\" [260]\n\n\nCargo\nFlight 370 was carrying 10,806 kg (23,823 lb) of cargo, of which four unit load devices (standardized cargo containers) of mangosteens (a tropical fruit) (total 4,566 kg (10,066 lb)) and 221 kg (487 lb) of lithium-ion batteries were of interest, according to Malaysian investigators [23]: 103, 107–109  According to the head of Malaysian police, Khalid Abu Bakar, the people who handled the mangosteens and the Chinese importers were questioned to rule out sabotage [266]\n\n\nUnresponsive crew or hypoxia\nAn analysis by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents—an in-flight upset (e.g., stall), a glide event (e.g., engine failure, fuel exhaustion), and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event—concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event \"best fit the available evidence\" for the five-hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track, [60]: 34  likely on autopilot [271] [272] No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory [273] If no control inputs were made following flameout and the disengagement of autopilot, the aircraft would likely have entered a spiral dive [60]: 33  and entered the ocean within 20 nmi (37 km; 23 mi) of the flameout and disengagement of autopilot [60]: 35 \n\n\nAftermath\nPublic communication from Malaysian officials regarding the loss of Flight 370 was initially beset with confusion [o] The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders [289] Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft [290]\n\n\nCriticism of Malaysian authorities' management of information\nPublic communication from Malaysian officials regarding the loss of Flight 370 was initially beset with confusion [o] The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders [289] Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft [290]\n\n\nMalaysia Airlines\nA month after the disappearance, Malaysia Airlines' chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined but failed to provide specific details This may have partially resulted from the suspension of the airline's advertising campaigns following the disappearance Ahmad stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the airline's \"primary focus...is that we do take care of the families in terms of their emotional needs and also their financial needs It is important that we provide answers for them It is important that the world has answers, as well.\" [300] In further remarks, Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370's disappearance [300] [301] In China, where the majority of passengers were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60% in March [302]\n\n\nFinancial troubles\nAt the time of Flight 370's disappearance, Malaysia Airlines was struggling to cut costs to compete with a wave of new, low-cost carriers in the region In the previous three years, Malaysia Airlines had booked losses of: RM1.17 billion (US$356 million) in 2013, RM433 million in 2012, and RM2.5 billion in 2011 [300] Malaysia Airlines lost RM443.4 million (US$137.4 million) in the first quarter of 2014 (January–March) [301] The second quarter—the first full quarter in the aftermath of Flight 370's disappearance—saw a loss of RM307.04 million (US$97.6 million), representing a 75% increase over losses from the second quarter of 2013 [310] Industry analysts expected Malaysia Airlines to lose further market share and face a challenging environment to stand out from competitors while addressing its financial plight [300] The company's stock, down as much as 20% following the disappearance of Flight 370, had fallen 80% over the previous five years, in contrast to a rise in the Malaysian stock market of about 80% over the same period [302]\n\n\nCompensation for passengers' next of kin\nLack of evidence in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, as well as the absence of any physical confirmation that the airplane crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and the payments made by insurance agencies [320] Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's next of kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 [p] from the airline's insurance company—amounting to a total of almost US$40 million for the 227 passengers on board [320]\n\n\nMalaysia\nMany air force experts raised questions and the Malaysian opposition levelled criticisms about the state of Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities Many criticised the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace [331] [332] [333] [334] The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance [333] The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation [333] [334]\n\n\nBefore 2016\nMany air force experts raised questions and the Malaysian opposition levelled criticisms about the state of Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities Many criticised the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace [331] [332] [333] [334] The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance [333] The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation [333] [334]\n\n\nMarch 2020\nOn 8 March 2020, six years after the disappearance, two memorial events were held to mark the anniversary [341] [342] Families of MH370 passengers called for a new search for the flight in a bid to seek closure Malaysia's former Transport Minister Anthony Loke had attended one of the events, expressing regret at being unable to table the compensation documents at the Cabinet level as per his original intent [343] The families hoped that the new Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong could expedite the compensation matters [344] [345]\n\n\nChina\nChinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xie Hangsheng reacted skeptically to the conclusion by the Malaysian government that the aircraft had gone down with no survivors, demanding on 24 March 2014 \"all the relevant information and evidence about the satellite data analysis\", and said that the Malaysian government must \"finish all the work including search and rescue.\" [347] [348] The following day, Chinese president Xi Jinping sent a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur to consult with the Malaysian government over the missing aircraft [349]\n\n\nRelatives of passengers\nIn the days following the disappearance of Flight 370, relatives of those on board became increasingly frustrated at the lack of news [47] On 25 March 2014, around two hundred family members of the Chinese passengers protested outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing [350] [351] Relatives who had arrived in Kuala Lumpur after the announcement continued with their protest, accusing Malaysia of hiding the truth and harbouring a murderer They also wanted an apology from the Malaysian government for its poor initial handling of the disaster and its \"premature\" conclusion of total loss, drawn without any physical evidence [352] An op-ed in state media outlet China Daily said that Malaysia was not wholly to be blamed for its poor handling of such a \"bizarre\" and \"unprecedented crisis,\" and appealed to the Chinese relatives not to allow emotions to prevail over evidence and rationality [353]\n\n\nBoycotts\nSome Chinese citizens boycotted all things Malaysian, including holidays and singers, in protest of Malaysia's handling of the Flight 370 investigation [359] [360] Bookings on Malaysia Airlines from China, where the majority of passengers were from, were down 60% in March [302] In late March, several major Chinese ticketing agencies—eLong, LY.com, Qunar, and Mango—discontinued the sale of airline tickets to Malaysia [359] [361] and several large Chinese travel agencies reported a 50% drop in tourists compared to the same period the year before [362] China was the third-largest source of visitors to Malaysia prior to Flight 370's disappearance, accounting for 1.79 million tourists in 2013 One market analyst predicted a 20–40% drop in Chinese tourists to Malaysia, resulting in a loss of 4–8 billion yuan (RM2.1–4.2 billion; US$0.65–1.3 billion) [362] [363]\n\n\nAir transport industry\nThe fact that a modern aircraft could disappear in a digitally connected world was met with surprise and disbelief by the public While changes in the aviation industry often take years to be implemented, airlines and air transport authorities responded swiftly to take action on several measures to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident [365] [366] [367] [368]\n\n\nAircraft tracking\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA)—an industry trade organisation representing more than 240 airlines (accounting for 84% of global air traffic)—and the ICAO began working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time [369] The IATA created a task force (which included several outside stakeholders) [369] to define a minimal set of requirements that any tracking system must meet, allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft The IATA's task force planned to come up with several short-, medium-, and long-term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search, rescue, and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident [370] The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014, but announced on that date that the report would be delayed, citing the need for further clarification on some issues [371] [372] In December 2014, the IATA task force recommended that, within 12 months, airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15-minute intervals The IATA itself did not support the deadline, which it believed could not be met by all airlines, but the proposed standard had the support of the ICAO Although the ICAO can set standards, it has no legal authority, and such standards must be adopted by member states [373] [374]\n\n\nTransponders\nThere was a call for automated transponders after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001; no changes were made because aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies [378] In the aftermath of Flight 370's disappearance, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting on the need to cut power to equipment in the event of a fire Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered [367]\n\n\nFlight recorders\nThe intensive and urgent search for the flight recorders in early April 2014, due to the 30-day battery life of the underwater locator beacons (ULBs) (or \"pingers\") attached to them, drew attention to their inherent limitations [r] [379] The maximum distance from the ULBs at which the signal can be detected is normally 2,000–3,000 m (6,600–9,800 ft), or 4,500 m (14,800 ft) under favourable conditions [60]: 11  Even if the flight recorders are located, the cockpit voice recorder memory has the capacity to store only two hours of data, continuously recording over the oldest data This storage capacity complies with regulations, which take account of the fact that it is usually only the data recordings from the last section of a flight that are needed to determine the cause of an accident However, the events that led to Flight 370 diverting from its course, before disappearing, took place more than two hours before the flight ended [380] Given these shortcomings, and the importance of the data stored on flight recorders, Flight 370 has brought to attention new technologies that enable data streaming to the ground [381] [382]\n\n\nSafety recommendations\nIn January 2015, the U.S National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety recommendations [s] related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations, and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders [385] [386]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been described as \"one of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation history\" [387] [388]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on to play for the local grammar school, which he attended from 1978 to 1983 He was also a passionate about diving, practising daily to perfect his techniques [8] He was a member of Britain's National Swimming Squad for 12 years, [9] [10] and competed for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10 metre, 3 metre, and 1 metre events [11] He said in a 2003 interview that his time with the national squad was a \"great experience\" that taught him \"discipline, focus, and certainly  [kept him] out of trouble\" [12]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile working as a model for French Connection, Statham was introduced to fledgling filmmaker Guy Ritchie, [18] who was developing a film and needed to fill the role of a streetwise con artist After learning about Statham's past as a market stall salesman, Ritchie cast him in the crime comedy thriller Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) [19] The film was well received by both critics and audiences, and helped put Statham in the public eye;

Born on July 26, 1967, in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, England, Statham rose to fame in the late 1990s with his breakout role in Guy Ritchie's crime comedy thriller Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJason Statham was born to Eileen (née Yates) and Barry Statham, a street seller and dancer. His father also worked odd jobs as a house painter, coal miner, and singer in the Canary Islands. Statham moved to Great Yarmouth, where he initially chose not to follow his father's career working the local market stalls. Instead, he practiced martial arts and became a passionate diver, training daily to perfect his techniques.\n\nStatham was a member of Britain's National Swimming Squad for 12 years, competing for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10 meter, 3 meter, and 1 meter events. He said in a 2003 interview that his time with the national squad was a \"great experience\" that taught him \"discipline, focus, and certainly kept him out of trouble.\"\n\n**Career**\n\nWhile working as a model for French Connection, Statham was introduced to fledgling filmmaker Guy Ritchie, who was developing a film and needed to fill the role of a streetwise con artist. After learning about Statham's past as a market stall salesman, Ritchie cast him in the crime comedy thriller Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). The film was well received by both critics and audiences, and helped put Statham in the public eye. For his role, he was paid £5,000.\n\nStatham's second collaboration with Ritchie came with Snatch (2000), which earned more than $80 million at the box office. For his role in Snatch, he was paid £15,000.

His role in The Mechanic was positively reviewed by the critics both in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nStatham returned to British film by starring in the police drama Blitz as Detective Sergeant Tom Brant. The film received mixed reviews, with Cath Clake of The Guardian reviewing it as \"not half bad\" and \"oddly entertaining.\" He was then cast in the action film Killer Elite, based on real events, which were the subject of Sir Ranulph Fiennes' novel The Feather Men. Statham played an assassin named Danny who comes out of retirement to save an old friend, played by Robert De Niro.\n\n**2016–present: Continued Success**\n\nThe sequel to his 2011 film The Mechanic was scheduled for production in late 2016 and announced to open as Mechanic: Resurrection.

According to Forbes, the film was Statham's \"seventh-biggest earner\" and most commercially successful solo film venture of his career.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nJason Statham's tough-guy image and action-packed film roles have made him a defining feature of the action-thriller genre. Statham has been compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, who dominated the genre in the 1980s and 1990s. Statham has cited Stallone, Bruce Lee, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, and Clint Eastwood as his inspirations.\n\n**In Popular Media**\n\nIn 2003, Statham appeared in three British television commercials for the Kit Kat chocolate bar.

Born in Paris to Malian parents, Kanté rose to prominence in the mid-2010s with his exceptional defensive skills and tireless work rate, earning him numerous accolades and recognition in the football world.\n\n# Club Career\n\n## Early Career\n\nBorn in Paris to Malian parents, Kanté began his career at the age of eight at JS Suresnes, in the western suburbs of the capital, remaining there for a decade. According to assistant manager Pierre Ville, Kanté remained outside the radar of big teams because of his small stature and selfless styles of play. He was rejected from the academy at Clairefontaine during this time.\n\nDuring his last season with Suresnes, in Promotion d'Honneur (PH, French 9th senior level), he scored 10 goals. In 2010, after Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger passed on the offer of signing Kanté, Suresnes' president (one of Wenger's best friends) personally drove him around to visit different clubs. He joined the reserve team of Boulogne, and made his professional debut in the last game of the Ligue 2 season on 18 May 2012, a 1–2 home defeat for his already relegated team to Monaco. He replaced Virgile Reset for the final 11 minutes.\n\n## Caen\n\nIn 2013, he joined Ligue 2 side Caen and played all 38 games in his first season as they came third in Ligue 2, earning them promotion to Ligue 1. In his second match on 9 August, he scored his first goal to equalise in a 2–1 win at Laval. He levelled again with his other goal of the campaign on 11 April 2014, in a 3–2 win at Istres.\n\n## Leicester City\n\nKanté was scouted for Premier League club Leicester City by Steve Walsh, who had previously facilitated the transfers of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez to the team. He was identified as the successor to Esteban Cambiasso. On 3 August 2015, he joined Leicester on a four-year contract, for an undisclosed fee reported to be worth €8 million (£5.6 million). He made his debut five days later by replacing Vardy for the final eight minutes of a 4–2 home win over Sunderland. On 7 November, he scored his first Premier League goal, in a 2–1 home win against Watford.\n\n## Chelsea\n\nOn 16 July 2016, Kanté signed a five-year deal with Chelsea who reportedly paid £32 million in transfer fees. Arsenal allegedly backed out of the deal due to agent fees involved which totaled more than £10 million, instead opting to sign Granit Xhaka. Due to disputes arising from the sharing of agent fees, Kanté was reported to have been subject to death threats. Kanté was given the number 7 shirt, left vacant since the exit of Ramires in January. According to Football Leaks, Chelsea offered to transfer a part of the salary into an offshore account to avoid taxes. Kanté refused; his lawyer stated in an email that \"N'Golo is flexible, he simply wants a normal salary.\"\n\n## 2016–2018: League and FA Cup champion\n\nOn 16 July 2016, Kanté signed a five-year deal with Chelsea who reportedly paid £32 million in transfer fees. Arsenal allegedly backed out of the deal due to agent fees involved which totaled more than £10 million, instead opting to sign Granit Xhaka. Due to disputes arising from the sharing of agent fees, Kanté was reported to have been subject to death threats. Kanté was given the number 7 shirt, left vacant since the exit of Ramires in January. According to Football Leaks, Chelsea offered to transfer a part of the salary into an offshore account to avoid taxes. Kanté refused; his lawyer stated in an email that \"N'Golo is flexible, he simply wants a normal salary.\"\n\n## 2018–2023: European and World champion\n\nHe signed a new five-year contract at Chelsea on 23 November 2018, making him Chelsea's highest-paid player. Kanté scored the first goal of Chelsea's 2–1 EFL Cup semi-final second leg win at home to Tottenham Hotspur. The score was tied 2–2 on aggregate at the end of 90 minutes, with Chelsea winning the shootout 4–2. Kanté scored on his 300th club appearance, a 2–2 home draw against Burnley on 22 April. Despite not being fully fit, Kanté started the 2018–19 Europa League final and dominated Arsenal's midfield as Chelsea won 4–1.\n\n## Al-Ittihad\n\nOn 21 June 2023, Kanté agreed to sign for Saudi Professional League club Al-Ittihad on 1 July upon the expiration of his Chelsea contract.\n\n# International Career\n\nBorn to Malian parents, Kanté was approached by Mali ahead of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations having not played for France in any of their age group teams. Kanté declined on the basis that he was still trying to establish himself in Ligue 1. Mali issued a further invitation to Kanté in January 2016, although he stated that he was still undecided about which national team to represent should he get an invite from France.\n\n# Player Profile\n\nA dynamic, diminutive, and disciplined player, Kanté is known for his relentless energy and excellent ball-winning abilities as a defensive midfielder in the centre of the pitch. This is attributed to his strong positional sense, off the ball movement, and ability to read the game. Predominantly known for his tactical awareness, intelligence, anticipation, and the defensive aspect of his game—his fearless attitude, ruthlessness, ability to tackle and regain possession, intercept passes, and block shots—Kanté is also capable of playmaking from inside his own half and is an efficient passer on the counter-attack, helping kick start attacking plays immediately after winning back the ball. He is also quick up and down the pitch and often makes late attacking runs in to the box.\n\n# Style of Play\n\nA dynamic, diminutive, and disciplined player, Kanté is known for his relentless energy and excellent ball-winning abilities as a defensive midfielder in the centre of the pitch.

His World Cup winning midfield partner, Paul Pogba, said he could outrun an entire team of 11 players. His league-title winning manager, Claudio Ranieri, often joked about him having \"batteries\" and said: \"One day, I'm going to see you cross the ball and then finish the cross with a header yourself.\"\n\n# Personal Life\n\nKanté is a practicing Muslim. He was born in Paris to Malian parents who migrated to France from Mali in 1980. He grew up in a small apartment in Rueil-Malmaison, Hauts-de-Seine. His father died shortly after N'Golo turned 11 and his older sibling Niama died of a heart attack before the 2018 World Cup.\n\n# Career Statistics\n\n| Club | Season | League | Cup | Continental | Other | Total |\n| Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals |\n| Boulogne | 2012–13 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | — | — | 3 | 0 |\n| Caen | 2013–14 | 38 | 0 | 1 | 0 | — | — | 39 | 0 |\n| Leicester City | 2015–16 | 37 | 1 | 3 | 0 | — | — | 40 | 1 |\n| Chelsea | 2016–17 | 37 | 1 | 9 | 0 | 10 | 0 | — | 56 | 1 |\n| 2017–18 | 38 | 2 | 5 | 0 | 14 | 1 | — | 57 | 3 |\n| 2018–19 | 37 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 16 | 0 | — | 55 | 2 |\n| 2019–20 | 34 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 8 | 0 | — | 44 | 1 |\n| 2020–21 | 29 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 0 | — | 37 | 0 |\n| Total | 205 | 7 | 20 | 0 | 55 | 1 | — | 280 | 8 |\n| Career total | 250 | 7 | 26 | 0 | 55 | 1 | — | 331 | 8 |\n\n# Honours\n\n| Team | Competition | Year | Result | Apps | Goals |\n| Leicester City | Premier League | 2015–16 | Winner | 37 | 1 |\n| Chelsea | FA Cup | 2016–17 | Winner | 7 | 0 |\n| UEFA Champions League | 2019–20 | Runner-up | 10 | 0 |\n| UEFA Super Cup | 2021 | Runner-up | 1 | 0 |\n| Al-Ittihad | Saudi Pro League | 2023–24 | Ongoing |  |  |\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"N'Golo_Kanté\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nBorn in Paris to Malian parents, [10] Kanté began his career at the age of eight at JS Suresnes, in the western suburbs of the capital, remaining there for a decade According to assistant manager Pierre Ville, Kanté remained outside the radar of big teams because of his small stature and selfless styles of play [11] He was rejected from the academy at Clairefontaine during this time [clarification needed] [12] During his last season with Suresnes, in Promotion d'Honneur (PH, French 9th senior level), he scored 10 goals [13] [14] In 2010, after Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger passed on the offer of signing Kanté, Suresnes' president (one of Wenger's best friends) personally drove him around to visit different clubs [15] He joined the reserve team of Boulogne, and made his professional debut in the last game of the Ligue 2 season on 18 May 2012, a 1–2 home defeat for his already relegated team to Monaco He replaced Virgile Reset for the final 11 minutes [16]\n\n\nBoulogne\nBorn in Paris to Malian parents, [10] Kanté began his career at the age of eight at JS Suresnes, in the western suburbs of the capital, remaining there for a decade According to assistant manager Pierre Ville, Kanté remained outside the radar of big teams because of his small stature and selfless styles of play [11] He was rejected from the academy at Clairefontaine during this time [clarification needed] [12] During his last season with Suresnes, in Promotion d'Honneur (PH, French 9th senior level), he scored 10 goals [13] [14] In 2010, after Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger passed on the offer of signing Kanté, Suresnes' president (one of Wenger's best friends) personally drove him around to visit different clubs [15] He joined the reserve team of Boulogne, and made his professional debut in the last game of the Ligue 2 season on 18 May 2012, a 1–2 home defeat for his already relegated team to Monaco He replaced Virgile Reset for the final 11 minutes [16]\n\n\nCaen\nIn 2013, he joined Ligue 2 side Caen and played all 38 games in his first season as they came third in Ligue 2, earning them promotion to Ligue 1 In his second match on 9 August, he scored his first goal to equalise in a 2–1 win at Laval;

Schut. The film stars Sylvester Stallone, Javon \"Wanna\" Walton, and Dascha Polanco. It was released on August 26, 2022, by United Artists Releasing and Amazon Studios, and is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in the fictional town of Granite City, where twin brothers Samaritan (Sylvester Stallone) and Nemesis (also played by Stallone) were once considered superhumans. At the time, the residents of Granite City burned down their home in an attempt to kill them, but the twins managed to escape. Their parents died in the fire, and the event left a lasting impact on the brothers.\n\nSamaritan grew up to become a superhero, determined to prove to the world that he is not like the monster they once thought him to be. On the other hand, Nemesis became a supervillain, consumed by a desire for revenge against the world that he believes wronged him.\n\nThe two brothers are evenly matched, and their confrontations are intense and destructive. However, Nemesis has created a mystical sledgehammer that gives him an edge over Samaritan. The hammer can hurt both brothers, and its power is a key factor in their battles.\n\nThe film's plot revolves around a confrontation between Samaritan and Nemesis at the city's power plant. The battle ends with both brothers seemingly killed in the explosion that destroys the plant. The city is left in darkness, and rumors spread that Samaritan may still be alive.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Sylvester Stallone, Javon \"Wanna\" Walton, and Dascha Polanco. Stallone plays the dual roles of Samaritan and Nemesis, bringing depth and nuance to the characters.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Bragi F. Schut and Balboa Productions, with Julius Avery at the helm. Schut wrote the screenplay prior to adapting the story into a series of graphic novels published by Mythos Comics.\n\nThe production team worked tirelessly to bring the film to life, with a focus on creating a visually stunning and action-packed experience. The film's score was composed by Jed Kurzel, who added to the overall tension and atmosphere of the movie.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe release of Samaritan was delayed several times, with initial plans to hit theaters on November 20, 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the film's release to be pushed back several times.\n\nThe film was eventually released on August 26, 2022, in the United States by United Artists Releasing and Amazon Studios. It was made available to stream on Prime Video, allowing audiences to access the film from the comfort of their own homes.\n\n**Streaming**\n\nThe release of Samaritan marked a significant milestone for Amazon Studios, which had acquired MGM earlier in the year. The film's availability on Prime Video marked a new era for the streaming platform, which has continued to grow and expand its offerings in recent years.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on January 3, 2023, by MGM Home Entertainment, in partnership with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received a mixed response from critics, with some praising its action sequences and performances.

candidates for president and vice president in the general election Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin [191]\n\n\nPresidency (2009–2017)\nThe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009 In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq [200] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, [201] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds [202] [203] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee [204] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records [205] He also revoked President George W Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion [206]\n\n\nFirst 100 days\nThe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009 In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq [200] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, [201] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds [202] [203] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee [204] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records [205] He also revoked President George W Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion [206]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nThe first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits [207] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children [208] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research [209]\n\n\nRacial issues\nIn his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, [223] [224] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era [225]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nOn October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability [235] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality [236] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign [237] [238] to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military [239]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nAs a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage [240] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages [241] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman I am not in favor of gay marriage.\" [242] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S president to do so [243] [244] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, [199] Obama became the first U.S president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address [245] [246] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v Perry (regarding same-sex marriage) [247] and United States v Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act) [248]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion (equivalent to $1118 billion in 2023) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession [249] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals [250] In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets [251]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nOn April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review [283] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government [284] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas [285]\n\n\nHealth care reform\nObama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal [296] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans [297] [298]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration [315] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya [316] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran [317] [318] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace [319] On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election [320]\n\n\nWar in Iraq\nOn February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months [330] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011 On August 19, 2010, the last U.S combat brigade exited Iraq Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces [331] [332] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over [333] On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\" [334]\n\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan\nIn his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a \"dangerous distraction\" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan, [342] the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again [343] Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S troop strength in Afghanistan He announced an increase in U.S troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan\", an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\" [344] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt Gen Stanley A McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war [345] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; [346] this took place in July 2011 David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article [347] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S troops by February 2014 [348] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation [349]\n\n\nDeath of Osama bin Laden\nStarting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad [351] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011 [351] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs [351] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound [352] [353] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, [354] which was buried at sea several hours later [355] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square [352] [356] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush [357]\n\n\nRelations with Cuba\nSince the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City [358] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill [359] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg [360]\n\n\nIsrael\nDuring the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries [366] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel [367] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem [368] [369] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so [370] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps [371]\n\n\nLibya\nIn February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring They soon turned violent In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution [382] passed unanimously by the U.S Senate [383] In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire However Gaddafi's forces continued to attack the rebels [384]\n\n\nSyrian civil war\nOn August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\" [395] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015 [396] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels [397] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015 [398] [399]\n\n\nIran nuclear talks\nOn October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015 The deal titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [404] [405] [406] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S and international sanctions.\" [407] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency [408] [409]\nOn a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House [410]\n\n\nRussia\nIn March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third [411] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S Senate ratified it in December 2010 [412] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries [413] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays, [414] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia [415]\n\n\nCultural and political image\nObama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement [418] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\" [419] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\" [420] Additionally, Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator [421] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses [422]\n\n\nJob approval\nAccording to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating, [423] the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in [424] His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009 [425] and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s, [426] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office [427] Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50–53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s [428] [429] [430]\n\n\nForeign perceptions\nPolls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency [444] [445] [446] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful [447] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn [448] [449]\n\n\nThanks, Obama\nIn 2009 the saying \"thanks, Obama\" first appeared in a Twitter hashtag \"#thanks Obama\" and was later used in a demotivational poster It was later adopted satirically to blame Obama for any socio-economic ills Obama himself used the phrase in video in 2015 and 2016 In 2017 the phrase was used by Stephen Colbert to express gratitude to Obama on his last day in office In 2022, President Joe Biden's Twitter account posted the phrase.\n\n\nPost-presidency (2017–present)\nObama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump [457] [458] The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C [459] On March 2, the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\" [460] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics [461] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H W Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities [462] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation, [463] which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office [464]\n\n\nLegacy and recognition\nObama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century [502] [503] [504] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\" Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama \"turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.\" Zeitzer calls this the \"defining paradox of Obama's presidency\" [505]\n\n\nPresidential library\nThe Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned presidential library It will be hosted by the University of Chicago and located in Jackson Park on the South Side of Chicago [530]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nObama received the Norwegian Nobel Committee's Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, The Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education's Ambassador of Humanity Award in 2014, the John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2017, and the Robert F Kennedy

I have ever known\", and \"a lonely witness for secular humanism.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\" [104]\n\n\nLegal career\nHe joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004 In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in Buycks-Roberson v Citibank Fed Sav Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D Ill.)

bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws [118] [119] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare [120] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor George Ryan's payday loan regulations and

of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system [168]\n\n\n2008\nOn February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois [165] [166] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic, as it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his

memoranda directing the U.S military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq [200] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, [201] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds [202] [203] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee [204] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records [205] He also revoked President George W Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion [206]\n\n\nFirst 100 days\nThe inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009 In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq [200] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, [201] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds [202] [203] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee [204] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records [205] He also revoked President George W Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion [206]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nThe first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits [207] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children [208] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research [209]\n\n\nRacial issues\nIn his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, [223] [224] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era [225]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nOn October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability [235] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality [236] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign [237] [238] to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military [239]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nAs a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage [240] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages [241] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman I am not in favor of gay marriage.\" [242] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S president to do so [243] [244] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, [199] Obama became the first U.S president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address [245] [246] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v Perry (regarding same-sex marriage) [247] and United States v Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act) [248]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion (equivalent to $1118 billion in 2023) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession [249] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals [250] In March 2009, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets [251]\n\n\nEnvironmental policy\nOn April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review [283] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government [284] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas [285]\n\n\nHealth care reform\nObama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal [296] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans [297] [298]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \"reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration [315] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya [316] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran [317] [318] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \"A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace [319] On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election [320]\n\n\nWar in Iraq\nOn February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months [330] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011 On August 19, 2010, the last U.S combat brigade exited Iraq Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces [331] [332] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over [333] On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\" [334]\n\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan\nIn his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a \"dangerous distraction\" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan, [342] the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again [343] Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S troop strength in Afghanistan He announced an increase in U.S troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan\", an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\" [344] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt Gen Stanley A McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war [345] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; [346] this took place in July 2011 David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article [347] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S troops by February 2014 [348] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation [349]\n\n\nDeath of Osama bin Laden\nStarting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad [351] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011 [351] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs [351] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound [352] [353] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, [354] which was buried at sea several hours later [355] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square [352] [356] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush [357]\n\n\nRelations with Cuba\nSince the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City [358] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill [359] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg [360]\n\n\nIsrael\nDuring the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries [366] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel [367] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem [368] [369] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so [370] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps [371]\n\n\nLibya\nIn February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring They soon turned violent In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution [382] passed unanimously by the U.S Senate [383] In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire However Gaddafi's forces continued to attack the rebels [384]\n\n\nSyrian civil war\nOn August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\" [395] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015 [396] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels [397] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015 [398] [399]\n\n\nIran nuclear talks\nOn October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015 The deal titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [404] [405] [406] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S and international sanctions.\" [407] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency [408] [409]\nOn a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House [410]\n\n\nRussia\nIn March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third [411] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S Senate ratified it in December 2010 [412] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries [413] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays, [414] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia [415]\n\n\nCultural and political image\nObama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement [418] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\" [419] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\" [420] Additionally, Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator [421] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses [422]\n\n\nJob approval\nAccording to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating, [423] the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in [424] His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009 [425] and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s, [426] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office [427] Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50–53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s [428] [429] [430]\n\n\nForeign perceptions\nPolls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency [444] [445] [446] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful [447] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn [448] [449]\n\n\nThanks, Obama\nIn 2009 the saying \"thanks, Obama\" first appeared in a Twitter hashtag \"#thanks Obama\" and was later used in a demotivational poster It was later adopted satirically to blame Obama for any socio-economic ills Obama himself used the phrase in video in 2015 and 2016 In 2017 the phrase was used by Stephen Colbert to express gratitude to Obama on his last day in office In 2022, President Joe Biden's Twitter account posted the phrase.\n\n\nPost-presidency (2017–present)\nObama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump [457] [458] The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C [459] On March 2, the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\" [460] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics [461] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H W Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities [462] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation, [463] which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office [464]\n\n\nLegacy and recognition\nObama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century [502] [503] [504] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\" Zeitzer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party

Wales (later King Charles III), and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, during the reign of his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II [3] [4] [5] Buckingham Palace announced his name – William Arthur Philip Louis – on 28 June [3] William was christened in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, on 4 August, coinciding with the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother [6] [b]\n\n\nEducation\nWilliam was educated at private schools, starting at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London [30] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by Rory Stewart [31] At Ludgrove, he participated in football, swimming, basketball, clay pigeon shooting, and cross country running He was subsequently admitted to Eton College, studying geography, biology, and history of art at A-Level He obtained an 'A' in geography, a 'C' in biology, and a 'B' in history of art [32] [33] [34] William was captain of the swimming team and his house football team at Eton, also taking up water polo [35] [36]\n\n\nEarly appointments and duties\nAt the age of 21, William was appointed a Counsellor of State; he first served in that capacity when the Queen attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the same year [50] In July 2005, he embarked on his first solo public engagements on an overseas tour of New Zealand, travelling to participate in World War II commemorations [51] [50] According to author Tina Brown, he had, like his father, expressed a desire to become Governor-General of Australia [52] In 2009 the Queen set up a private office for William and Harry with David Manning as their adviser [53] Manning accompanied William on his first official tour in January 2010 as the latter toured Auckland and Wellington; William opened the new building of the Supreme Court of New Zealand and was welcomed by a Māori chief [54] [55]  The visit spurred crowds of \"many thousands\", with positive  public reception compared to that of his mother's 1983 tour [56] In March 2011, William visited Christchurch, New Zealand, shortly after the earthquake, [57] and spoke at the memorial service at Hagley Park on behalf of his grandmother [58] He also travelled to Australia to visit areas affected by flooding in Queensland and Victoria [59] [60]\n\n\nMilitary and air ambulance service\nHaving decided on a military career, William was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006; his admission was based on successfully completing a 44-week course as an Officer Cadet which led to his commission as a British Army officer [65] [66] As \"Lieutenant Wales\" – a name based on his father's then title Prince of Wales – he followed his brother [67] into the Blues and Royals in December that year as a troop commander in an armoured

He was born on June 21, 1982, to Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. William is the elder son of the couple and has two younger siblings, Prince Harry and Lady Sarah McCorquodale.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPrince William was born at 21:03 BST on June 21, 1982, in St Mary's Hospital, London. The announcement of his birth was made by Buckingham Palace on June 28, 1982.

His christening coincided with the 82nd birthday of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\n\n**Education**\n\nWilliam was educated at private schools, starting at Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London. He later attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by Rory Stewart.

Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus on the day of his wedding in April 2011 [148] [149] He and Catherine toured Canada that summer [150] Nicholas Witchell, writing for BBC News, noted that the tour to Canada had been an \"unqualified success\" for the couple as they engaged in various activities from tree planting to street hockey, with their warm interactions and thoughtful gestures enhancing their popularity and reinforcing positive sentiments towards the monarchy in Canada [151] The couple served as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, during multiple sporting events throughout the games [152]\n\n\nPrince of Wales\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, and William's father succeeded as Charles III William, now heir apparent, was created Prince of Wales by his father on 9 September [195] Controversy regarding the title became a topic of public debate in Wales [196] By 17 September, a petition calling for the end of the title had received over 30,000 signatures, [197] while a YouGov poll showed 66 per cent support for William to be given the title compared to 22 percent of respondents opposed [198] On 30 October, Senedd Llywydd Elin Jones noted that an investiture is not a constitutional requirement and suggested that contemporary Wales would deem it unnecessary [199] Kensington Palace also stated an investiture is \"not on the table\" [200] As the eldest son of the British monarch, William has inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, which brings him additional income [201] [202] The duchy is \"a £760 million (about US$1.25 billion) entity established in 1337\" to provide a private income to the monarch's eldest son [62]\n\n\nCharity work\nWilliam became aware of HIV/AIDS in the mid-1990s when he accompanied his mother and brother on visits to shelters and clinics for patients In January 2005, he and Harry volunteered at a British Red Cross aid distribution centre to pack emergency supplies for countries affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami [213] Later, in December 2005, William spent two weeks in North Wales with Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW) [214] In May 2007, he became patron of MREW and president of the Royal Marsden Hospital, the latter of which was a role previously held by his mother [215]\n\n\nHumanitarian causes\nIn March 2020, William appeared in a video for the National Emergencies Trust, launching a fundraising appeal to help charities during the pandemic The appeal raised £11 million in its first week, eventually totalling to £90 million, with the money going out to \"front line charities\" and to the UK Community Foundations to be distributed among \"local community foundations\" [222] In April 2020, he officially became patron of the organisation [223] Later that month, he made a surprise appearance on The Big Night In, a telethon held during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a skit which he held a video call with Stephen Fry, who reprised his role as (a descendant of) Lord Melchett, from the Blackadder series [224]\n\n\nConservation\nWilliam became patron of the Tusk Trust in December 2005, a charity that works towards conserving wildlife and initiating community development across Africa [235] He carried out his first official duty with the Trust in launching a 5,000-mile (8,000 km) bike ride across the African continent in April 2008 [236] Later, William helped with launching the Tusk Conservation Awards, which have been presented to selected environmental activists annually since 2013 [237] In June 2010, he and his brother visited Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa, undertaking projects relating to wildlife, sport, and young children [238] In 2013 he succeeded his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, as president of Fields in Trust and transitioned into the role of patron in 2024 [239] [240] He established the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce in December 2014, with the goal of reducing global illegal wildlife trade [241] In 2014 Jane Goodall stated that William had expressed the view that all ivory in the royal collection needed to be destroyed [242] William has occasionally commented on the effects of overpopulation on the wildlife of Africa, but his remarks have been criticised in the media for not taking resource consumption and population density into consideration [243]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nWilliam has spoken out for LGBT rights as part of his work against cyberbullying, stating the importance of being \"proud of the person you are\" and discussing the effects of online abuse and discrimination [252] In 2016 he appeared in the July issue of Attitude and became the first member of the royal family to be featured on the cover of a gay magazine [253] He was recognised at the British LGBT Awards in May 2017 [252] William hosted a commemorative Pride Month discussion with mental health charity volunteers at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in June 2023 [254]\n\n\nMental health\nSince 2009, William has been patron of Child Bereavement UK, which provides support to children and families who have lost a loved one [255] In 2016 the Royal Foundation launched multiple mental health initiatives, including Heads Together, a campaign led by William, Catherine and Harry to de-stigmatise mental health [256] Legacy programmes include Mental Health at Work, launched in September 2018 to change the approach to workplace mental health in the United Kingdom, as well as Heads Up, launched in May 2019 in partnership with the Football Association, utilising football to affect the conversation surrounding mental health in adults [257] Later that month, William and Catherine, together with William's brother Harry and sister-in-law Meghan, launched Shout, the United Kingdom's first 24/7 text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues [258] William later volunteered on the crisis helpline during the COVID-19 lockdowns to provide support via text message [259] He attributes his interest in mental health to his experiences as an air ambulance pilot, his work with the homeless, veterans' welfare, and his wife's anti-addiction advocacy [26]\n\n\nHomelessness\nIn September 2005, William became patron of Centrepoint, a charity that assists the homeless [270] In December 2009, as part of a Centrepoint-organised event, the prince spent the night in a sleeping bag near Blackfriars Bridge to raise awareness of the experiences of homeless youth [271] He opened their new facility, Apprenticeship House, in November 2019 to mark their 50th anniversary [272]\n\n\nSport\nWilliam often plays polo to raise money for charity [283] He is a fan of football, and supports the English club Aston Villa [284] He became president of England's Football Association (FA) in May 2006 and vice-royal patron of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in February 2007, supporting the Queen as patron [285] The same year, the WRU's decision to name the Prince William Cup drew criticism as some believed it would have been more appropriate to name it after Ray Gravell [286] [287] William became patron of the WRU and the FA in 2016 and 2024, respectively [288] [240]\n\n\nPublic image\nWilliam has been one of the most popular members of the British royal family since his birth [305] [306] [307] Having lived a public life since birth, he was regarded as a \"heartthrob\" and eligible as a young adult, similar to his father [308] [309] [310] Ruth La Ferla of The New York Times contrasted William's \"refined\" and \"polite\" appeal to Leonardo DiCaprio's \"bad-boy\" popularity [311] Following his marriage, William's public image assumed a more \"staid\" and fatherly demeanour, having \"settled into a stable domestic order.\" [312] [313]\n\n\nPrivacy and the media\nThe death of William's mother while being chased by the paparazzi in August 1997 [321] has since influenced his attitude towards the media [322] He and Catherine have often requested that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected [322] In 2005 William spoke with ITV reporter Tom Bradby and concluded that it was likely that their voicemails were being accessed [323] An investigation under then Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke concluded that the compromised voice mail accounts belonged to William's aides, including Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, [324] and not the prince himself [325] However, Clive Goodman later stated that he had hacked William's phone on 35 occasions [326] William later sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of News of the World and The Sun, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement in 2020 [327] He and his brother Harry brought a claim privately through their mutual attorneys, but Harry later pursued his case separately with a new solicitor [327] [328]\n\n\nTitles, styles, and honours\nWilliam has been a British prince since birth, and was known as \"Prince William of Wales\" until April 2011 He was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus by his grandmother, Elizabeth II, on the day of his wedding The letters patent granting these titles were issued on 26 May that year [343] [344]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nWilliam has been a British prince since birth, and was known as \"Prince William of Wales\" until April 2011 He was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of

The game is played with a unique set of rules and variations, reflecting the informal and dynamic nature of children's play.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe Squid Game is typically played between two teams, with a designated playing area that consists of a large figure, often referred to as the \"squid.\" The squid is usually drawn on the ground, and the game court is divided into three main areas: the top circle, the middle triangle, and the bottom rectangle. The top circle serves as the home base for the offensive team, while the middle triangle and bottom rectangle form the home base for the defensive team.\n\n**General Rule Elements**\n\nOne of the defining features of the Squid Game is the concept of \"houses.\" In the game, the home bases for each team are referred to as \"houses.\" The top circle, which serves as the home base for the offensive team, is often referred to as \"area 1,\" while the middle triangle and bottom rectangle, which form the home base for the defensive team, are referred to as \"area 3.\" The figure that makes up the game court, excluding area 1, is commonly referred to as the \"squid.\"\n\n**Regional Variations**\n\nDue to the informal and dynamic nature of children's play, there are no official rules governing the Squid Game. As a result, the game has evolved into various regional variations, each with its unique set of rules and characteristics. These regional variations often reflect the local culture and traditions of the area where the game is played.\n\n**Regional Names**\n\nIn different parts of Korea, the Squid Game is known by various names.

The game typically involves ten or more participants and is believed to have originated from the large presence of squid in the waters around Gadeokdo island, as well as the popularity of squid as a snack among local children.\n\nThe game starts with the division of two teams, each consisting of at least ten players. A squid with a pentagon-shaped body and a round tail is drawn, and the team that wins a game of rock-paper-scissors becomes the defensive team, while the team that loses becomes the offensive team. If the offensive team reaches the house of the defensive team and shouts \"Ttaeng!\" (땡!), the sound of a bell, the game is won by the offensive team, and the two teams change sides.\n\n**Squid Unification Game**\n\nSquid Unification Game, also known as \"ojingeo tongilnoli,\" is a regional variation of the Squid Game that is based in Haenam.
