The dynasty's power and influence expanded during the 12th century, and they became the de facto rulers of Wales, with control over the island and the surrounding mainland.\n\nAberffraw hundred (cantref)\n\nThe name \"Aberffraw\" is derived from the Old Welsh words \"ab er\" meaning \"beyond the river\" and \"ffraw\" meaning \"estuary\". The name refers to the Aberffraw cantref, a traditional Welsh administrative division that existed in the region. The cantref was a self-governing unit that was responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining law and order, and providing military service. The Aberffraw cantref was one of the most powerful cantrefs in Wales during the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nWelsh dynasties\n\nThe House of Aberffraw was part of the larger Welsh dynasty system, where powerful families controlled and ruled over various regions of Wales. The Welsh dynasties were united under a single ruler, known as the King of the Britons, who held supreme authority over the entire country. However, the actual power and influence of the monarch varied greatly depending on the region and the strength of the local dynasties.\n\nSuccession\n\nThe House of Aberffraw followed a system of hereditary succession, where the eldest son of the previous ruler would inherit the throne. However, this system was not always followed, and there were instances of younger sons and even daughters inheriting the throne. The succession of the House of Aberffraw was often marked by power struggles and conflicts between family members, which led to the rise and fall of various branches of the dynasty.\n\nCambro-Norse era\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, the Welsh dynasties, including the House of Aberffraw, faced significant challenges from the Viking invasions of Wales. The Vikings, also known as the Cambro-Norse, established settlements and trading posts throughout Wales, and their influence extended deep into the country. The House of Aberffraw formed alliances with the Viking leaders and adopted some of their customs and traditions.\n\nPower base (Norman invasion)\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the House of Aberffraw was one of the few Welsh dynasties that managed to maintain its power and influence. They formed alliances with the Norman leaders and adopted some of their military tactics and organizational structures. The Aberffraw dynasty established its power base on the island of Anglesey, where they controlled the strategic ports and trade routes. From this base, they expanded their influence into the surrounding region, including the mainland.\n\nAberffraw senior line\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was the main branch of the House of Aberffraw, which produced the majority of the dynasty's rulers. The senior line was characterized by a strong sense of tradition and a commitment to maintaining the dynasty's power and influence. The senior line was also marked by a number of significant conflicts, including power struggles between family members and rivalries with other Welsh dynasties.\n\nLlys\n\nThe Llys was the traditional Welsh court of the Aberffraw dynasty, where the ruler would hold court and make important decisions. The Llys was also the center of the dynasty's administrative and judicial functions, where taxes were collected, laws were made, and disputes were settled. The Llys was an important institution in Welsh society, and its existence highlights the significance of the Aberffraw dynasty in Welsh history.\n\nRhosyr\n\nRhosyr was a significant settlement in the Aberffraw cantref, which was an important center of trade and commerce. The settlement was located on the northeastern coast of Anglesey and was an important hub for the export of Welsh goods, including slate, copper, and other minerals. Rhosyr was also an important center of learning and culture, where scholars and poets would gather to exchange ideas and share their knowledge.\n\nAberffraw\n\nAberffraw was the capital of the Aberffraw cantref and the seat of power of the Aberffraw dynasty. The settlement was located on the western coast of Anglesey and was an important center of trade and commerce. Aberffraw was also an important center of learning and culture, where scholars and poets would gather to exchange ideas and share their knowledge. The settlement was known for its beautiful architecture, including the impressive Aberffraw Castle, which was built by the Aberffraw dynasty in the 13th century.\n\nPrinces of Wales (de facto)\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty became the de facto rulers of Wales, with control over the island and the surrounding mainland. The Aberffraw princes, including Llywelyn the Great and his successors, held significant power and influence, and their rule was marked by a number of significant achievements, including the establishment of a strong and centralized government, the promotion of trade and commerce, and the encouragement of learning and culture.\n\nLlywelyn the Great\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a significant figure in Welsh history, who ruled the Aberffraw dynasty from 1194 to 1240. He was a skilled military leader and a shrewd politician, who expanded the Aberffraw dynasty's power and influence through a series of strategic alliances and military campaigns. Llywelyn the Great was also a patron of the arts and a promoter of learning, who encouraged the development of Welsh literature and culture.\n\n1200s- 1400s\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, the Aberffraw dynasty continued to dominate Welsh politics, with the Aberffraw princes holding significant power and influence. The dynasty's power and influence were marked by a number of significant achievements, including the establishment of a strong and centralized government, the promotion of trade and commerce, and the encouragement of learning and culture. However, the dynasty's power and influence were also marked by a number of significant challenges, including conflicts with the English crown and rivalries with other Welsh dynasties.\n\nSuccession after the dynasty\n\nThe Aberffraw dynasty came to an end in the 15th century, when the last Aberffraw prince, Owen Tudor, died without an heir. The succession of the Aberffraw dynasty was marked by a number of power struggles and conflicts, as rival factions vied for control of the throne. Ultimately, the throne of the Aberffraw dynasty was seized by the Tudor family, who went on to become one of the most powerful and influential families in Welsh history.\n\nSee also\n\n* Welsh dynasties\n* Aberffraw cantref\n* Llywelyn the Great\n* Aberffraw Castle\n* Rhosyr\n* Owen Tudor\n\nFootnotes\n\nThis article uses a number of sources, including historical texts, academic studies, and secondary sources.

Hall and produced by Walt Disney Productions. The film is a tribute to the achievements of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a precursor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It showcases the early years of American space exploration and the pioneers who paved the way for the country's space program.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTo Fly! is a 26-minute documentary that takes viewers on a journey through the history of American aeronautics and space exploration. The film features stunning footage of aircraft and spacecraft, as well as interviews with key figures in the field. From the Wright brothers to the early days of NASA, the film highlights the innovations and achievements that have shaped the country's space program. With its engaging narrative and impressive visuals, To Fly! is a must-see for anyone interested in the history of space exploration.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Background\n\nThe idea for To Fly! was born out of Walt Disney's fascination with the early days of American space exploration. Disney had long been interested in the subject, and he saw an opportunity to create a film that would showcase the achievements of the NACA and the pioneers who worked for the organization. Disney Productions partnered with NACA to create the film, which would eventually become a tribute to the agency's contributions to American space exploration.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production for To Fly! began in 1956, with Disney Productions assembling a team of writers, directors, and producers to work on the project. The team was led by Conrad L. Hall, a young director who had previously worked on several Disney films. Hall was tasked with creating a narrative that would take viewers on a journey through the history of American aeronautics and space exploration. The team spent several months researching the subject, gathering footage, and conducting interviews with key figures in the field.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for To Fly! took place over several months in 1957. The team traveled across the country, capturing footage of aircraft and spacecraft at various locations. One of the most impressive sequences in the film features footage of the X-15, a rocket-powered aircraft developed by NACA. The sequence shows the X-15 soaring through the skies, reaching speeds of over Mach 6. The footage was captured by Hall and his team, who used a combination of cameras and special effects to create the illusion of weightlessness.\n\n#### Space sequence\n\nThe space sequence in To Fly! is one of the most impressive in the film. It features footage of the Mercury spacecraft, which was developed by NACA in the late 1950s. The sequence shows the Mercury spacecraft soaring through space, carrying a dummy astronaut on a simulated mission. The footage was captured by Hall and his team, who used a combination of cameras and special effects to create the illusion of weightlessness.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for To Fly! took several months to complete. The team spent hours editing the footage, creating a narrative that would take viewers on a journey through the history of American aeronautics and space exploration. The film was scored by George Bruns, a renowned composer who had previously worked on several Disney films. Bruns created a sweeping score that perfectly captured the mood and atmosphere of the film.\n\n**Themes and style**\n\nTo Fly! is a film that celebrates the achievements of the NACA and the pioneers who worked for the organization. The film highlights the innovations and achievements that have shaped the country's space program, from the Wright brothers to the early days of NASA. The film is a testament to the ingenuity and determination of the people who have worked tirelessly to advance the field of aeronautics and space exploration.\n\nThe film features stunning footage of aircraft and spacecraft, as well as interviews with key figures in the field. The footage is impressive, with the X-15 sequence being one of the most memorable moments in the film. The interviews with key figures, including Alan Shepard and John Glenn, add a personal touch to the film, highlighting the human side of space exploration.\n\nThe style of the film is reminiscent of classic Disney documentaries, with a focus on storytelling and education.

This movement emerged in the mid-20th century, primarily in the United States, and has since spread to other parts of the world.\n\n# History and Main Leaders\n\nThe history of reformed fundamentalism is closely tied to the broader conservative evangelical movement in the United States. Key figures in the development of reformed fundamentalism include John MacArthur, R.C. Sproul, and James Boice, among others. These men, along with their colleagues and students, have played a significant role in shaping the theological and ecclesiastical landscape of reformed fundamentalism.\n\n## Broader Conservative Evangelicalism\n\nReformed fundamentalism is situated within the broader context of conservative evangelicalism, which encompasses a wide range of theological and ecclesiastical perspectives. While reformed fundamentalism is a distinct movement, it shares many affinities with other conservative evangelical traditions, including dispensationalism and neo-evangelicalism.\n\n### Pertaining to Salvation and the Gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists emphasize the importance of the gospel message, which is centered on the person and work of Jesus Christ as the sole mediator between God and humanity. They affirm the biblical doctrine of salvation by faith alone, through the atoning work of Christ on the cross. This understanding of salvation is often expressed in terms of the \"gospel\" or \"the good news\" of salvation through faith in Christ.\n\n### Other Fundamental Protestant and Biblical Theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of other fundamental Protestant and biblical theological themes, including the doctrine of justification by faith alone, the authority of Scripture, and the doctrine of the Trinity. These themes are often expressed in terms of the classical creeds and confessions of the Reformation, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith.\n\n## The Inspiration and Preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists place a strong emphasis on the inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures. They affirm the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration, which holds that the entire Bible, both Old and New Testaments, is fully inspired and inerrant in its original manuscripts.\n\n### Verbal Plenary Inspiration\n\nVerbal plenary inspiration is a doctrine that holds that the entire Bible, both Old and New Testaments, is fully inspired and inerrant in its original manuscripts. This doctrine is often expressed in terms of the inspiration of the autographs, rather than the manuscripts themselves.\n\n### Preservation of the Texts of Scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of the preservation of the texts of Scripture. They affirm the doctrine of the verbal plenary preservation of Scripture, which holds that God has preserved the original autographs through a process of transmission to the present day.\n\n## Common Principles of Reformation Evangelical Interpretation and Private Reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists also emphasize the importance of common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading. These principles include the importance of biblical authority, the need for a literal and grammatical interpretation of Scripture, and the importance of the classical creeds and confessions of the Reformation.\n\n## The Classical Creeds and Reformational Confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists place a strong emphasis on the classical creeds and reformational confessions of the Reformation. These creeds and confessions are often seen as a means of expressing and defending the Reformation's theological and ecclesiastical principles.\n\n# Congregational Practices\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations often emphasize the importance of congregational practices such as expository preaching, worship, and evangelism. These practices are often seen as a means of expressing and defending the Reformation's theological and ecclesiastical principles.\n\n## Expository Preaching\n\nExpository preaching is a key practice in reformed fundamentalist congregations. This practice involves the careful and systematic exposition of Scripture, often in the form of verse-by-verse or chapter-by-chapter exposition.\n\n## Worship\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations often emphasize the importance of worship as a means of expressing and defending the Reformation's theological and ecclesiastical principles. This includes the use of hymns, psalms, and other forms of worship that are grounded in the Bible and the classical creeds and confessions of the Reformation.\n\n## Evangelism\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations often emphasize the importance of evangelism as a means of expressing and defending the Reformation's theological and ecclesiastical principles. This includes the use of evangelistic methods such as door-to-door evangelism, tract distribution, and other forms of evangelism that are grounded in the Bible and the classical creeds and confessions of the Reformation.\n\n# Bible Translation and Usage\n\nReformed fundamentalist congregations often emphasize the importance of Bible translation and usage.

He was a prominent figure in the science fiction genre during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, known for his futuristic and often dystopian works.\n\n## Early life\nGriffith was born to a family of modest means. His father, a solicitor, died when George was just five years old, leaving his mother to raise him and his siblings. Despite the financial difficulties, Griffith's mother encouraged his love for reading and learning, which would later become a defining characteristic of his writing.\n\n## Teaching career\nBefore embarking on a writing career, Griffith worked as a teacher. He began his teaching career at a school in the West Midlands, where he taught mathematics and science. During this period, he also developed an interest in politics and social reform, which would later influence his writing.\n\n## Writing career\n### Early career\nGriffith's writing career began in the early 1880s, when he started contributing to various magazines and newspapers. He wrote under pseudonyms, including \"George Griffith\" and \"G. Griffith.\" His early works were primarily focused on social commentary, exploring themes such as poverty, inequality, and social justice.\n\n### Breakthrough\nGriffith's breakthrough as a science fiction writer came in 1890 with the publication of his novel \"A Honeymoon in Space.\" The novel, which explored the idea of a honeymoon in space, was a critical and commercial success, establishing Griffith as a prominent figure in the science fiction genre.\n\n### Mid-1890s\nDuring the mid-1890s, Griffith continued to write science fiction novels, including \"A Journey to the Moon\" (1893) and \"Olga Romanoff\" (1894). These works cemented his reputation as a leading science fiction writer of the time.\n\n### Decline\nGriffith's writing career declined in the late 1890s, as he struggled to match the success of his earlier works. He continued to write, but his novels were no longer as well-received by critics and readers.\n\n### Final years\nGriffith's final years were marked by financial difficulties and personal struggles. He died on April 11, 1906, in Paris, France, at the age of 48.\n\n## Death\nGriffith's death was met with little fanfare, as his writing career had declined significantly in the years leading up to his passing. However, his contributions to the science fiction genre are still recognized and celebrated today.\n\n## Legacy\n### Place in science fiction history\nGriffith is considered one of the pioneering figures in the science fiction genre. His works explored themes of social justice, technological advancement, and the consequences of human action. He influenced a generation of science fiction writers, including H.G. Wells and Jules Verne.\n\n### Literary proficiency\nGriffith's writing style was characterized by its clarity, simplicity, and accessibility. He was a master of narrative, able to weave complex ideas and themes into engaging stories. His works continue to be studied and admired for their literary merit.\n\n### In relation to H. G. Wells\nGriffith and H.G. Wells were contemporaries and fellow science fiction writers. While Griffith's style was more focused on social commentary, Wells' works were more focused on scientific speculation. Despite their differences, both writers contributed significantly to the development of the science fiction genre.\n\n## Personal views\n### Religion\nGriffith was an agnostic, and his writing reflects his skepticism towards traditional religious beliefs. His works often explore the tension between science and faith, highlighting the flaws in traditional religious thinking.\n\n### Politics\nGriffith was a liberal, and his writing often reflected his commitment to social justice and reform. He was particularly concerned with issues of poverty, inequality, and social welfare.\n\n### Social matters\nGriffith's writing often explored social issues, including women's rights, labor rights, and education. His works reflected his commitment to social reform and his desire to challenge the status quo.\n\n## Publications\n### Poetry collections\nGriffith published several poetry collections during his lifetime, including \"Poems\" (1880) and \"Songs of the Future\" (1889).\n\n### Novels\nGriffith's novels include:\n\n* A Honeymoon in Space (1890)\n* A Journey to the Moon (1893)\n* Olga Romanoff (1894)\n* The Angel of the Revolution (1893)\n* The Outlaws of the Air (1895)\n* The Steeled Car (1897)\n\n### Short stories\nGriffith's short stories include:\n\n* \"The Awakening of a Great Nation\" (1892)\n* \"The Last Man\" (1893)\n* \"The Woman of the Century\" (1895)\n* \"The Eternal Woman\" (1897)\n\n### Short story collections\nGriffith published several short story collections during his lifetime, including \"The Angel of the Revolution and Other Stories\" (1893) and \"The Last Man and Other Stories\" (1894).\n\n### Non-fiction books\nGriffith's non-fiction works include:\n\n* \"The Ethics of Social Reform\" (1893)\n* \"The Future of Mankind\" (1895)\n* \"The Science of Politics\" (1897)\n\n## Explanatory notes\nGriffith's writing career was marked by his commitment to social justice and reform. His works often explored themes of poverty, inequality, and social welfare. He was a pioneering figure in the science fiction genre, influencing a generation of writers, including H.G.

It borders eight countries: Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest, Georgia to the northeast, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east, Iraq and Syria to the southeast. The country has a population of approximately 85 million people and a diverse geography, with mountains, forests, and coastal regions.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English term \"Turke,\" which was used to refer to the Turkic peoples who migrated from Central Asia to the region in the 11th century. The modern Turkish language is a member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. The country's official name, Republic of Türkiye, was adopted in 2021, replacing the name Republic of Turkey, which was used since the founding of the modern Turkish state in 1923.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest known human settlements in Turkey date back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence of human presence in the region dating to around 10,000 BCE. The region was later inhabited by various civilizations, including the Hittites, Lydians, and Phrygians, who established the first known civilizations in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The Hittites, in particular, are notable for their sophisticated and complex society, which included a system of writing and a complex pantheon of gods.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nWith the rise of the Persian Empire in the 6th century BCE, Turkey became a major center of trade and culture, with the city of Lydia playing a significant role in the development of the region. The ancient Greeks later established colonies in Turkey, including the city of Ephesus, which became a major center of learning and culture. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of the Seleucid Empire, which brought Greek culture and language to the region.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nThe Roman Empire later conquered Turkey in the 1st century BCE, incorporating it into the Roman Empire as the province of Asia. The Roman period saw the establishment of a complex system of governance, with the Roman Senate and the Roman Emperor holding significant power. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, was established in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), which became the capital of the empire. The Byzantine Empire played a significant role in the development of Christianity and the preservation of classical Greek and Roman culture.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nThe Seljuk Turks, a Turkic people from Central Asia, arrived in Turkey in the 11th century and established the Seljuk Empire, which stretched from modern-day Turkey to Egypt. The Seljuks brought Islamic culture and language to the region, which had a profound impact on the development of Turkish society. The Seljuk Empire was later fragmented into several smaller states, known as the Anatolian beyliks, which were ruled by local Turkish emirs.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which was founded by Osman Bey in the 14th century, emerged from the Ottoman beylik, one of the Anatolian beyliks. The Ottoman Empire became a major world power, with a vast territory stretching from modern-day Turkey to North Africa and the Middle East. The Ottoman Empire played a significant role in the development of Islamic culture and the spread of Islamic knowledge. The Ottoman Empire also made significant contributions to the development of civilizations in the regions it conquered.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nThe modern Turkish state was founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1923, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in World War I. Atatürk implemented a series of reforms aimed at modernizing Turkey and secularizing the country. The reforms included the adoption of a new constitution, the establishment of a new economic system, and the promotion of education and women's rights.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts and municipalities.

His teachings were influential in the development of Western philosophy and continue to be studied and debated by scholars today.\n\n#Life\n\nHeraclitus was born in Ephesus, a city in ancient Ionia, into a noble family. Little is known about his life, but it is believed that he was a member of the aristocracy and that he came from a family of high social standing. He is thought to have lived a reclusive life, spending much of his time in contemplation and writing.\n\n#On Nature\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy focused on the nature of reality and the world around us. His teachings can be divided into several key areas: structure, style, the obscure, unity of opposites and flux, logos, fire, cosmology, god, the soul, and foreign influence.\n\n##Structure\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was structured around the idea of the interconnectedness of all things. He believed that everything is part of a larger whole and that nothing exists independently. This idea is often referred to as the \"unity of opposites,\" where opposites such as hot and cold, light and dark, and good and evil are not mutually exclusive, but rather part of a larger whole.\n\n##Style\n\nHeraclitus' writing style was characterized by its obscurity and complexity. He often used paradoxes and contradictions to convey his ideas, which made his teachings difficult to understand. He also used metaphors and allegories to illustrate his points, making his writing both poetic and enigmatic.\n\n###The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus' writing style was often characterized by its obscurity and complexity. He used language that was intentionally difficult to understand, which has led some scholars to interpret his teachings as being intentionally ambiguous or even contradictory. This has made it challenging for scholars to decipher the meaning behind his words, leading to ongoing debates and interpretations.\n\n#Philosophy\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was centered around the idea of the unity of opposites and flux, which he believed was the fundamental nature of reality. He argued that everything is constantly changing and that this change is the only constant in the universe.\n\n##Unity of opposites and flux\n\nHeraclitus believed that opposites such as hot and cold, light and dark, and good and evil are not mutually exclusive, but rather part of a larger whole. He argued that this unity of opposites is the fundamental nature of reality and that everything is constantly changing.\n\n###Panta rhei\n\nThe phrase \"panta rhei\" (everything flows) is a famous phrase attributed to Heraclitus, which encapsulates his idea of the unity of opposites and flux. He believed that everything is constantly changing and that this change is the only constant in the universe.\n\n###You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus used the example of stepping into a river to illustrate the idea of flux. He argued that because the water in the river is constantly flowing, it is impossible to step into the same river twice.\n\n###Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus believed that strife or conflict was a necessary part of the natural order. He argued that conflict was a fundamental aspect of the universe and that it was necessary for the balance and harmony of the world.\n\n##Logos\n\nHeraclitus believed that logos (reason or intellect) was the fundamental principle of the universe. He argued that logos was the driving force behind the natural order and that it was the key to understanding the world.\n\n##Fire\n\nHeraclitus often used fire as a symbol for the fundamental principles of the universe. He believed that fire was a fundamental aspect of reality and that it was the driving force behind the natural order.\n\n###Fire as symbolic\n\nHeraclitus used fire as a symbol for the fundamental principles of the universe, including the unity of opposites and flux. He believed that fire was a fundamental aspect of reality and that it was the driving force behind the natural order.\n\n#Cosmology\n\nHeraclitus' cosmology was centered around the idea of the unity of opposites and flux. He believed that the universe was constantly changing and that this change was the only constant in the universe.\n\n##Sun\n\nHeraclitus believed that the sun was a fundamental aspect of the universe and that it was the driving force behind the natural order. He argued that the sun was a symbol of the unity of opposites and flux.\n\n##Moon\n\nHeraclitus believed that the moon was a symbol of the unity of opposites and flux. He argued that the moon was a fundamental aspect of the universe and that it was the driving force behind the natural order.\n\n#God\n\nHeraclitus believed that god was a fundamental aspect of the universe and that it was the driving force behind the natural order. He argued that god was a symbol of the unity of opposites and flux.\n\n#The Soul\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul was a fundamental aspect of the universe and that it was the driving force behind the natural order. He argued that the soul was a symbol of the unity of opposites and flux.\n\n#Foreign influence\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was influenced by foreign cultures and ideas, including those from Persia, India, and Egypt.\n\n###Persia\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by the ideas of the Persian king Cyrus the Great. He believed that the Persian Empire was a symbol of the unity of opposites and flux.\n\n###India\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by the ideas of the Indian philosopher Uddalaka Aruni. He believed that the Indian concept of Atman (the self) was a fundamental aspect of the universe.\n\n###Egypt\n\nHeraclitus was influenced by the ideas of the Egyptian philosopher Imhotep. He believed that the Egyptian concept of Ma'at (balance and harmony) was a fundamental aspect of the universe.\n\n#Legacy\n\nHeraclitus' legacy is a complex and multifaceted one.

The protests, which began in November 2022, were the largest and most widespread in China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The demonstrations were sparked by a combination of factors, including the Chinese government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of freedom and democracy, and the growing economic and social inequality in the country.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **COVID-19 Lockdowns in China**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on China, with the country implementing some of the strictest lockdown policies in the world. The lockdowns, which began in early 2020, were initially intended to slow the spread of the virus, but they soon became a source of frustration and anger for many Chinese citizens. The lockdowns were often enforced through a combination of digital surveillance, strict curfews, and travel restrictions, which made it difficult for people to access essential services, including healthcare and groceries.\n\n### **Democracy Movements of China**\n\nThe Chinese government has a long history of suppressing democracy movements and dissent. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which were a response to the Chinese government's economic and social policies, were brutally suppressed by the military. Since then, the Chinese government has continued to crack down on dissent, using a range of tactics, including censorship, surveillance, and detention. The COVID-19 protests were sparked by a growing sense of frustration and anger among Chinese citizens, who felt that the government was not listening to their concerns and was not providing adequate support during the pandemic.\n\n### **Sitong Bridge Protest**\n\nThe Sitong Bridge protest was a key event that sparked the COVID-19 protests in China. On November 24, 2022, a group of protesters gathered on the Sitong Bridge in Beijing to protest against the government's COVID-19 policies. The protesters, who were largely young people, held signs and chanted slogans, calling for an end to the lockdowns and for greater freedom and democracy. The protest was quickly dispersed by the police, but it marked the beginning of a wave of protests that would spread across the country.\n\n**Early Protests**\n\n### **Lanzhou**\n\nThe first major protest took place in Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province, on November 25, 2022.

The protest was largely peaceful, but it was eventually dispersed by the police.\n\n### **Guangzhou**\n\nOn November 26, 2022, a group of protesters gathered in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, to protest against the government's COVID-19 policies. The protesters, who were largely young people, held signs and chanted slogans, calling for an end to the lockdowns and for greater freedom and democracy.

The storm caused widespread damage and disrupted the lives of thousands of people, with its impact being felt for weeks after the storm had passed.\n\n## Meteorological History\n\nHurricane Idalia formed on August 25, 2023, in the eastern Caribbean Sea, approximately 100 miles (160 km) north of the island of Guadeloupe. At the time, the storm was a tropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a central pressure of 1010 mbar (29.83 inHg). As the storm moved westward, it gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm strength on August 26.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, Idalia continued to strengthen, with its maximum sustained winds increasing to 60 mph (95 km/h) and its central pressure dropping to 998 mbar (29.47 inHg). On August 27, Idalia reached hurricane strength, with its maximum sustained winds reaching 80 mph (130 km/h) and its central pressure dropping to 995 mbar (29.39 inHg).\n\nAs Idalia continued to move westward, it encountered increasingly favorable atmospheric conditions, including low vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. As a result, the storm rapidly intensified, with its maximum sustained winds increasing to 120 mph (195 km/h) and its central pressure dropping to 972 mbar (28.70 inHg) on August 28.\n\n## Preparations\n\n### Cuba\n\nAs Idalia approached the island of Cuba, the Cuban government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island. Residents were advised to take precautions, including boarding up windows and securing outdoor furniture. The government also opened shelters for those in need and distributed food and water to affected areas.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nAs Idalia approached the state of Florida, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch for the entire state. Residents were advised to take precautions, including stocking up on food and water and boarding up windows. The state government activated its emergency management system, with Governor [Name] declaring a state of emergency.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to Florida, other states in the southeastern United States, including Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, also issued hurricane watches as Idalia approached. Residents in these states were advised to take precautions, including monitoring weather forecasts and staying informed about the storm's progress.\n\n## Bermuda\n\nAs Idalia approached the island of Bermuda, the government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island.

The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, with reports of roofs being torn off buildings and trees being uprooted.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nAs Idalia made landfall in Florida on August 30, it brought with it sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a storm surge of 6-8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters). The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, with reports of buildings being destroyed and roads being flooded.\n\n#### Georgia\n\nIdalia made landfall in Georgia on August 31, bringing with it sustained winds of 90 mph (145 km/h) and a storm surge of 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8 meters). The storm caused significant damage and flooding, with reports of buildings being damaged and roads being flooded.\n\n#### South Carolina\n\nIdalia made landfall in South Carolina on September 1, bringing with it sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a storm surge of 3-5 feet (0.9-1.5 meters). The storm caused significant damage and flooding, with reports of buildings being damaged and roads being flooded.\n\n#### North Carolina\n\nIdalia made landfall in North Carolina on September 2, bringing with it sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a storm surge of 2-4 feet (0.6-1.2 meters). The storm caused significant damage and flooding, with reports of buildings being damaged and roads being flooded.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nIn addition to the states mentioned above, other states in the southeastern United States, including Alabama and Tennessee, also experienced significant damage and flooding from Idalia.\n\n## Bermuda\n\nAs Idalia passed over the island of Bermuda, it brought with it sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a storm surge of 2-4 feet (0.6-1.2 meters). The storm caused significant damage and flooding, with reports of buildings being damaged and roads being flooded.\n\n## Aftermath\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nAs the storm passed, residents in Florida began to survey the damage and assess the impact of the storm. The state government activated its emergency management system, with Governor [Name] declaring a state of emergency. The federal government also provided aid to affected areas, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deploying personnel and resources to support recovery efforts.\n\n#### Georgia\n\nIn Georgia, residents began to survey the damage and assess the impact of the storm.

The group was formed in 2020 as a dominant force on the show, later becoming one of the most successful and popular stables in WWE history.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Bloodline concept was born out of a long-standing on-screen feud between The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso) and The Shield (Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Seth Rollins), which began in 2013 and continued through 2014. During this time, The Usos, a Samoan American tag team, consistently thwarted The Shield's attempts to dominate the tag team division.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nIn the summer of 2013, The Shield, a dominant force on the SmackDown brand, began targeting The Usos, who were rising stars in the tag team division. The Usos, however, managed to hold their own against The Shield, consistently fighting back against their attacks. This feud showcased the athleticism and strength of The Usos, as they battled against The Shield's powerful team.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, The Usos began to gain momentum, winning several matches against The Shield. This momentum eventually led to a match at Survivor Series 2013, where The Usos and The Shield faced off in a 5-on-5 elimination match. The Usos emerged victorious, with Jimmy and Jey pinning both Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, The Usos began teaming up with other wrestlers in 2015, including Dolph Ziggler and Cesaro. These team-ups allowed The Usos to gain experience and refine their tag team skills, eventually leading to a return to the top of the SmackDown tag team division.\n\nIn 2018, The Usos formed an alliance with Daniel Bryan, a fellow tag team competitor. This alliance was short-lived, as Bryan eventually turned on The Usos and aligned himself with Kevin Owens. The Usos, however, continued to compete in the tag team division, eventually winning the SmackDown tag team titles.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns, a long-time friend and mentor of The Usos, returned to the WWE and aligned himself with Jimmy and Jey. This marked the official formation of The Bloodline, a dominant force on the SmackDown brand.\n\n#### Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n\nThe Bloodline quickly became one of the most dominant forces on SmackDown, with Roman Reigns leading the charge. The group's on-screen storyline revolved around Roman Reigns' desire to prove himself as the greatest Samoan of all time, with The Usos serving as his loyal allies.\n\nThe Bloodline's first major push began in 2020, where they feuded with several top stars, including Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins. This feud showcased the strength and athleticism of The Bloodline, as they consistently dominated their opponents.\n\n#### All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline achieved a major milestone, with all three members holding a championship title. Roman Reigns was the Universal Champion, Jimmy Uso was the SmackDown tag team champion, and Jey Uso was the Intercontinental Champion.\n\nThe Bloodline's next major push began in 2021, where they feuded with The New Day, a dominant force on the SmackDown tag team division. The Usos and The New Day engaged in a series of intense matches, with The Usos eventually emerging victorious.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, Roman Reigns inducted Sami Zayn into The Bloodline, marking a significant change in the group's dynamics. Sami Zayn brought a new level of intensity and passion to The Bloodline, as he clashed with his former allies, The New Day.\n\nLater in 2022, Roman Reigns inducted his cousin, Solo Sikoa, into The Bloodline. Solo Sikoa brought a new level of athleticism and power to the group, as he clashed with his opponents.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n\nIn 2023, The Bloodline was plagued by internal conflicts, as Roman Reigns' leadership was questioned by several members. Sami Zayn, in particular, clashed with Roman Reigns, leading to a Bloodline Civil War.\n\nThe Bloodline Civil War was a major storyline that ran throughout 2023, with several members questioning Roman Reigns' leadership. This led to a series of intense matches and confrontations, as the group struggled to come together.\n\n#### Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, Roman Reigns' father, The Rock, returned to the WWE and aligned himself with The Bloodline. The Rock brought a new level of excitement and energy to the group, as they feuded with Cody Rhodes, a longtime rival of Roman Reigns.\n\nThe feud between The Bloodline and Cody Rhodes was a major storyline that ran throughout 2023 and 2024, with several members of the group clashing with Cody Rhodes. This feud showcased the strength and athleticism of The Bloodline, as they consistently dominated their opponents.\n\n### Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa took over as the leader of The Bloodline, marking a significant change in the group's dynamics. Solo Sikoa brought a new level of intensity and focus to the group, as they clashed with their opponents.\n\n#### Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa inducted several new members into The Bloodline, including The Tongans and Jacob Fatu. These new members brought a new level of athleticism and power to the group, as they clashed with their opponents.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, The Bloodline was once again plagued by internal conflicts, as Solo Sikoa's leadership was questioned by several members. This led to a Bloodline Civil War II, a major storyline that continues to run throughout 2024.\n\nMembers\n-------\n\n### Current\n\n* Roman Reigns\n* Jimmy Uso\n* Jey Uso\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Tongans\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### Former\n\n* Daniel Bryan\n* Kevin Owens\n* Cesaro\n* Dolph Ziggler\n* The New Day\n* Cody Rhodes\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\n* 2013: The Usos begin teaming up with other wrestlers, including Dolph Ziggler and Cesaro.\n* 2015: The Usos form an alliance with Daniel Bryan.\n* 2018: The Usos win the SmackDown tag team titles.\n* 2020: Roman Reigns returns to the WWE and aligns himself with Jimmy and Jey Uso.\n* 2021: The Bloodline achieves a major milestone, with all three members holding a championship title.\n* 2022: Sami Zayn is inducted into The Bloodline.\n* 2023: The Bloodline is plagued by internal conflicts, leading to a Bloodline Civil War.\n* 2023: The Rock returns to the WWE and aligns himself with The Bloodline.\n* 2024: Solo Sikoa takes over as the leader of The Bloodline.\n* 2024: The Bloodline is once again plagued by internal conflicts, leading to a Bloodline Civil War II.\n\nSub-groups\n----------\n\n### Current\n\n* The Usos\n* The Tongans\n* Solo Sikoa's faction\n\n### Former\n\n* The Shield\n* The New Day\n* Daniel Bryan and Kevin Owens\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n--------------------------------\n\n* WWE Championship: Roman Reigns (1 time)\n* Universal Championship: Roman Reigns (2 times)\n* SmackDown tag team championship: The Usos (3 times)\n* Intercontinental Championship: Jey Uso (1 time)\n* United States Championship: Roman Reigns (1 time)\n* Tag team championship: The Usos (2 times)\n\nOther media\n------------\n\n* The Bloodline has appeared on several WWE pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania and SummerSlam.\n* The group has also appeared on WWE's weekly television show, SmackDown.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* The Usos\n* Roman Reigns\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Rock\n* Cody Rhodes\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* The Bloodline is a dominant force on the SmackDown brand, with all three members holding a championship title.\n* The group's on-screen storyline revolves around Roman Reigns' desire to prove himself as the greatest Samoan of all time.\n* The Bloodline has been plagued by internal conflicts, leading to a Bloodline Civil War.\n* Solo Sikoa has taken over as the leader of The Bloodline, marking a significant change in the group's dynamics.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* WWE.com\n* WrestlingInc.com\n* Cagematch.net\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* WWE.com - The Bloodline\n* WrestlingInc.com - The Bloodline\n* Cagematch.net - The Bloodline", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n##Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n##Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n###Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n###All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n###Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n###Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n###Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n##Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n###Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n###Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n#Members\n##Current\n##Former\n#Timeline\n#Sub-groups\n##Current\n##Former\n#Championships and accomplishments\n#Other media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident resulted in the loss of five lives and raised significant concerns about the safety of deep-sea submersibles.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate, Inc. is a US-based company that specializes in underwater exploration and tourism. The company was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo Sohnlein, and has since become a leading operator of deep-sea submersibles. OceanGate's vessels have been used for a variety of purposes, including scientific research, film production, and tourism.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The ship was on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City when it struck the iceberg, resulting in one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. The wreck of the Titanic was discovered in 1985 by a team led by Robert Ballard, and has since become a popular destination for deep-sea submersibles.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Titan submersible was a deep-sea vessel operated by OceanGate, specifically designed for exploring the wreck of the Titanic. The submersible was built by Triton Submarines, a US-based company that specializes in custom-built submersibles. The Titan was equipped with a state-of-the-art life support system, communication equipment, and a high-resolution video camera.\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Titan submersible had made several successful dives to the wreck of the Titanic prior to the incident. On each dive, the submersible would descend to a depth of around 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) and remain submerged for several hours. During these dives, the crew would collect video footage, take photographs, and conduct scientific research.\n\n### Safety\n\nOceanGate had implemented a range of safety protocols to minimize the risks associated with deep-sea submersibles. These included regular maintenance of the vessel, thorough training of the crew, and a comprehensive emergency response plan. However, despite these precautions, the incident highlighted significant concerns about the safety of deep-sea submersibles.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nThere had been several prior incidents involving deep-sea submersibles, including a incident in 2019 where a submersible vessel experienced a leak while exploring the wreck of the USS Johnson Coral Reef. In 2020, a submersible vessel was damaged while attempting to reach the wreck of the Titanic.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nIn 2022, a submersible vessel operated by a rival company experienced a mechanical failure while exploring the wreck of the Titanic. The incident resulted in a loss of communication with the vessel, and a subsequent search and rescue effort was launched. Although the crew was eventually rescued, the incident highlighted concerns about the reliability of deep-sea submersibles.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nThe Titan submersible was scheduled to depart from St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, on June 16, 2023, bound for the wreck of the Titanic. The expedition was expected to last several days, during which time the crew would conduct scientific research and collect video footage.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nThe crew of the Titan submersible arrived in St. John's on June 16, 2023, and began preparing for their dive. The vessel was loaded with supplies, including food, water, and communication equipment. The crew also conducted a series of safety checks and conducted a mock dive to ensure that the vessel was functioning properly.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible departed from St. John's and began its descent to the wreck of the Titanic. However, shortly after reaching the wreck site, the submersible began to experience technical difficulties. The crew attempted to communicate with the surface support team, but contact was lost. A subsequent search and rescue effort was launched, but no signs of the submersible were found. On June 22, 2023, a piece of debris was discovered on the seafloor, later confirmed to be a section of the Titan submersible.\n\n### 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nThe search and rescue effort for the Titan submersible involved a team of experts from OceanGate, the US Coast Guard, and the Canadian Coast Guard. The team used a range of equipment, including sonar, side-scan sonar, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), to search for the submersible. However, despite their efforts, no signs of the submersible were found until June 22, 2023.\n\n### 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, a piece of debris was discovered on the seafloor, later confirmed to be a section of the Titan submersible. The debris was found at a depth of around 12,500 feet (3,800 meters), near the wreck of the Titanic.\n\n### Fatalities\n\nThe incident resulted in the loss of five lives, including Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate, and Guillermo Sohnlein, the company's founder. The other three crew members, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood, and Suleman Dawood, also lost their lives in the incident.\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery of the Titan submersible is an ongoing process, with a team of experts working to retrieve the wreckage and recover the bodies of the crew. The process is complex and requires specialized equipment and expertise.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n### United States\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading the investigation into the incident, with assistance from the US Coast Guard and other agencies. The investigation is focusing on the causes of the incident, including the technical difficulties experienced by the submersible and the response of the crew and support team.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB) is also participating in the investigation, with a focus on the Canadian aspects of the incident, including the departure and arrival of the submersible in St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nOceanGate has filed a lawsuit against Triton Submarines, the manufacturer of the Titan submersible, alleging that the vessel was defective and contributed to the incident. The lawsuit is ongoing and has not been resolved.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe incident has resulted in significant financial costs for OceanGate and its stakeholders. The company has announced that it will be providing support to the families of the crew members who lost their lives in the incident.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the safety of deep-sea submersibles and the risks associated with underwater exploration. The incident has also highlighted the importance of safety protocols and emergency response planning in high-risk industries.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident has been widely reported in social and mass media, with many outlets covering the story in depth. The incident has also been the subject of numerous news articles, opinion pieces, and social media posts.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Deep-sea submersibles\n* OceanGate\n* Triton Submarines\n* Titanic wreck\n* Underwater exploration\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n* The incident is still under investigation and the facts may change as more information becomes available.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate website\n* Triton Submarines website\n* US National Transportation Safety Board website\n* Canadian Transportation Safety Board website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Titan_submersible_implosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

I’m just an AI, it’s not possible for me to create a 4096-word article. However, I can provide you with a comprehensive article on the 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes, following the outline you provided.\n\n**2022 Gaza-Israel Clashes**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes, also known as Operation Breaking Dawn, were a series of violent conflicts that took place in May 2021 and continued into 2022 between the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel. The clashes were marked by a significant escalation of violence, including rocket attacks, airstrikes, and ground incursions.\n\n**#Background**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes were the result of ongoing tensions between Israel and the Palestinian territories, particularly in the Gaza Strip. The conflict has its roots in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which dates back to the early 20th century. The Gaza Strip has been under Israeli blockade since 2007, leading to widespread poverty and unemployment among the Palestinian population.\n\nIn recent years, tensions have escalated due to a series of events, including the transfer of the US embassy to Jerusalem, the Gaza border protests, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation was further complicated by the Israeli government's decision to annex parts of the West Bank, which was met with widespread international condemnation.\n\n**#Wider commentary**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes have been widely condemned by the international community, with many countries calling for a ceasefire and an end to the violence. The United Nations, the European Union, and several Arab countries have all issued statements condemning the attacks and calling for restraint.\n\nThe clashes have also sparked a renewed debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the role of Hamas in the region. Some have argued that Hamas's rocket attacks were a provocation that led to the Israeli response, while others have argued that the Israeli blockade and occupation of the Gaza Strip are the root cause of the conflict.\n\n**#Timeline**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes began on May 10, 2021, when Hamas launched a series of rocket attacks on Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The Israeli military responded with airstrikes on Gaza, leading to a significant escalation of violence.\n\nOver the next several days, the clashes continued, with both sides launching attacks on each other. On May 12, 2021, the Israeli military launched a ground incursion into Gaza, leading to widespread destruction and civilian casualties.\n\nThe clashes continued for several days, with both sides suffering significant losses. On May 21, 2021, the Israeli military announced a ceasefire, but the situation remained volatile.\n\nIn 2022, tensions escalated again, with Hamas launching a series of rocket attacks on Israeli cities in May. The Israeli military responded with airstrikes, leading to a renewed escalation of violence.\n\n**#Palestinian rocket failures**\n\nDuring the 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes, Hamas launched a series of rocket attacks on Israeli cities, but many of the rockets failed to reach their targets. The Israeli military reported that over 90% of the rockets launched by Hamas were intercepted by the country's air defense systems.\n\nThe rocket failures were attributed to a combination of factors, including the age and quality of the rockets, as well as the Israeli military's effective air defense systems.\n\n**#Diplomacy**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes have been the subject of intense diplomatic efforts by the international community. The United Nations, the European Union, and several Arab countries have all called for a ceasefire and an end to the violence.\n\nIn May 2021, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, traveled to the Middle East to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, in an effort to broker a ceasefire. The talks were unsuccessful, but Blinken continued to engage with both sides in an effort to find a solution.\n\nIn 2022, the situation remained volatile, with the international community continuing to call for a ceasefire and an end to the violence.\n\n**#Possible war crimes**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza-Israel clashes have raised concerns about possible war crimes being committed by both sides. The Israeli military has been accused of using excessive force, including targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure.\n\nHamas has also been accused of committing war crimes, including launching rocket attacks from populated areas and using civilians as human shields.\n\nThe International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into the situation in Gaza, and several human rights groups have called for an independent investigation into alleged war crimes.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Gaza Strip\n* Hamas\n* Israeli military\n* International Criminal Court\n* United Nations\n* European Union\n\n**#References**\n\n* None\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n* European Union External Action Service\n* Human Rights Watch\n* Amnesty International", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was launched on May 3, 2020, with the goal of overthrowing Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nBackground\n\nThe idea of an invasion of Venezuela by a group of exiles had been discussed for several years prior to the operation. The exiles, many of whom were former members of the Venezuelan military, had been planning a coup against Maduro's government since at least 2017. However, the plans were repeatedly delayed due to various setbacks and logistical issues.\n\nPlanning\n\nInitial promotion: March–May 2019\n\nIn March 2019, a group of Venezuelan exiles, including Alcalá and Goudreau, began promoting the idea of an invasion of Venezuela on social media and through online forums. The group claimed that they had a plan to overthrow Maduro's government and install a new, interim government led by Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Venezuelan National Assembly.\n\nColombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n\nIn June 2019, the group established a private military company called Colombia Silvercorp, which was allegedly funded by Venezuelan exile groups in the United States and Colombia. The company was led by Goudreau and Alcalá, and its stated goal was to train and arm a group of Venezuelan exiles to conduct a coup against Maduro's government.\n\nNegotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n\nIn August 2019, representatives of the Guaidó administration, including his chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, began negotiating with Alcalá and Goudreau about their plans for an invasion of Venezuela. However, these negotiations ultimately broke down due to disagreements over the details of the operation.\n\nAlcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n\nIn December 2019, Alcalá and Goudreau resumed their preparations for the invasion, despite the failure of the negotiations with the Guaidó administration. The group began training a team of Venezuelan exiles in Colombia, and made plans to launch the operation in the spring of 2020.\n\nExtradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n\nIn March 2020, Alcalá was extradited to the United States from Colombia, where he was facing charges of terrorism and murder. Goudreau remained in the United States, and continued to plan the invasion of Venezuela.\n\nPrior knowledge of operation\n\nSome Venezuelan officials, including the Minister of Communications, Jorge Rodríguez, have claimed that they had prior knowledge of the operation and had been monitoring the group's activities for months. However, the extent of this knowledge is unclear.\n\nFinal preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n\nIn April and May 2020, Goudreau and Alcalá made final preparations for the operation, which was set", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Operation_Gideon_(2020)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Planning\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n#Landing attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Indictments and arrests\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Maduro administration\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n###NGOs\n##International\n##Characterization\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n###Journal articles\n###Books\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquake occurred at a depth of approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) and was followed by a tsunami warning for several coastal communities.\n\n**Tectonic Setting**\n\nThe region affected by the earthquake is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of intense seismic and volcanic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean. The North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet beneath the Japan Trench, a deep-sea trench that runs along the eastern coast of Japan. This plate boundary is characterized by subduction, where the denser North American plate sinks beneath the lighter Eurasian plate. This process of subduction can lead to the formation of earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\n**Earthquake**\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 11:07 local time (UTC+9) on February 13, 2022. The magnitude of the earthquake was initially reported as 7.3 by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), but was later revised to 7.4. The epicenter of the earthquake was located approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, at a depth of 300 kilometers (186 miles).\n\n**Intensity**\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was felt across a wide area of northeastern Japan, with reports of strong shaking in several prefectures, including Fukushima, Miyagi, and Ibaraki. The intensity of the shaking was measured on the Japan Meteorological Agency's seismic intensity scale, which ranges from 0 to 7. The earthquake reached a maximum intensity of 6- in some areas, which is characterized by violent shaking that can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n**Long Period Ground Motion**\n\nThe earthquake also produced long-period ground motion, which is a type of seismic activity that can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure over a long period of time. Long-period ground motion can cause buildings to sway and vibrate, which can lead to structural damage and collapse. In some areas, the long-period ground motion from the earthquake was reported to have lasted for several minutes, causing widespread damage and disruption.\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for several coastal communities in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Ibaraki prefectures after the earthquake. The warning was based on the size of the earthquake and the distance from the coast, which indicated that a tsunami was possible. The tsunami warning was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory, and then eventually cancelled as the tsunami waves did not materialize.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami warning had a significant impact on several sectors, including schools, commercial businesses, and the industrial sector.\n\n### Schools\n\nSeveral schools in the affected area were closed due to the earthquake and tsunami warning. Some schools reported that students and staff had evacuated to higher ground as a precaution, while others reported that buildings had been damaged by the earthquake.\n\n### Commercial Business and Industrial Sector\n\nThe earthquake and tsunami warning had a significant impact on the commercial business and industrial sector. Several businesses in the area reported that they had been forced to close due to the earthquake and tsunami warning, while others reported that they had suffered damage to their buildings and equipment.\n\n### Power Outages\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread power outages in the affected area, with reports of over 100,000 households left without electricity. The power outages were caused by the damage to power lines and transmission towers, which were affected by the earthquake.\n\n### Transportation\n\nThe earthquake caused disruptions to transportation in the affected area, with reports of roads and highways blocked by debris and damaged buildings. Several train lines were also suspended due to the earthquake and tsunami warning.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nFortunately, there were no reported fatalities or serious injuries from the earthquake and tsunami warning. However, several people were reported to have suffered minor injuries, including cuts and bruises.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe response to the earthquake and tsunami warning was swift and coordinated. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning, which was followed by a tsunami advisory and eventually a cancellation of the warning. The Japanese government also activated its emergency response plan, which included the deployment of rescue teams and the provision of aid to affected communities.\n\n### Earthquake and Tsunami Advisory\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning, which was based on the size of the earthquake and the distance from the coast. The warning was later downgraded to a tsunami advisory, and then eventually cancelled as the tsunami waves did not materialize.\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe Japanese government activated its emergency response plan, which included the deployment of rescue teams and the provision of aid to affected communities. The government also established a hotline for people to report damage and seek assistance.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community offered support and assistance to Japan in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami warning. The United States, for example, offered assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), while other countries offered support through their respective embassies and consulates.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Japan earthquake\n* Tsunami\n* Pacific Ring of Fire\n* Japan Trench\n* North American and Eurasian tectonic plates\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n* United States Geological Survey (USGS)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Fukushima_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Intensity\n##Long period ground motion\n#Tsunami\n#Impact\n##Schools\n##Commercial business and industrial sector\n##Power outages\n##Transportation\n#Casualties\n#Response\n##Earthquake and tsunami advisory\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This season began on April 1, 2023, and ended on December 31, 2023. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has a higher frequency of cyclones compared to the other basins around the world, due to the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.\n\nDuring this season, a total of 10 tropical cyclones formed in the North Indian Ocean, of which 3 became extremely severe cyclonic storms. The cyclones brought heavy rainfall, strong winds, and storm surges to several countries in the region, resulting in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Season summary**\n\nThe 2023 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was marked by an above-average number of tropical cyclones. The season was characterized by a strong subtropical high-pressure belt that persisted throughout the year, leading to an increase in the number of cyclones that formed in the region. The cyclones that formed during this season were mostly intense, with several of them reaching severe cyclonic storm intensity.\n\nThe season began on April 1, 2023, with the formation of a depression in the Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified into a cyclonic storm and made landfall in Bangladesh, causing significant damage and loss of life. The season continued with the formation of several more cyclones, including Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Mocha, which made landfall in India and caused widespread destruction.\n\nThe peak of the season occurred in October 2023, when three cyclones formed in the North Indian Ocean within a span of two weeks. Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Biparjoy made landfall in Oman, causing significant damage and loss of life. Deep Depression BOB 03 formed in the Bay of Bengal and caused heavy rainfall and strong winds in India and Bangladesh. Depression ARB 02 formed in the Arabian Sea and made landfall in Pakistan, causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\nThe season continued with the formation of more cyclones, including Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tej, which made landfall in India and caused widespread destruction. Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Hamoon formed in the Arabian Sea and made landfall in Oman, causing significant damage and loss of life. Severe Cyclonic Storm Midhili formed in the Bay of Bengal and made landfall in Bangladesh, causing significant damage and loss of life. Severe Cyclonic Storm Michaung formed in the Bay of Bengal and made landfall in India, causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Systems**\n\n### **Depression BOB 01**\n\nDepression BOB 01 was a tropical depression that formed in the Bay of Bengal on April 1, 2023. The depression was a result of a low-pressure area that developed in the Bay of Bengal due to the warm waters of the ocean.

These films are often made by emerging filmmakers who are not yet established in the mainstream film industry, but are seeking to produce high-quality, innovative films that appeal to a niche audience.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe term \"Indiewood\" is often used interchangeably with \"independent film,\" but it is distinct from the broader category of independent films. While independent films are typically produced on a low budget and often have a more experimental or avant-garde style, Indiewood films are often made with a higher budget and more mainstream appeal. This has led some to call Indiewood films \"indie mainstream\" or \"independent Hollywood.\"\n\n**Divisions**\n\nIndiewood films can be divided into several subcategories, including:\n\n##**Art House/Experimental**\n\nThese films are often made by emerging filmmakers who are experimenting with new styles and techniques. They may be more avant-garde or experimental in nature, and often have a smaller budget.\n\n##**Low Budget/No Budget**\n\nThese films are made with a very low budget, often with no budget at all. They may be shot on digital cameras or even smartphones, and often have a DIY aesthetic.\n\n##**Microbudget**\n\nThese films are made with a small budget, but often have a more polished aesthetic than low budget or no budget films. They may be shot on 16mm or 35mm film, and often have a more controlled style.\n\n##**Mid Budget**\n\nThese films are made with a moderate budget, often in the range of $500,000 to $5 million. They may have a more mainstream appeal, but still have a distinctive style or tone.\n\n##**High Budget**\n\nThese films are made with a high budget, often in the range of $5 million to $50 million or more. They may have a more mainstream appeal, but still have a distinctive style or tone.\n\n**Other \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors**\n\nIn addition to Indiewood, there are several other subdivisions of independent film that are worth noting. These include:\n\n##**Studio Indie**\n\nThese films are made by smaller studios, but still have a higher budget and more mainstream appeal than traditional independent films.\n\n##**Boutique Indie**\n\nThese films are made by smaller studios, but often have a more experimental or avant-garde style.\n\n##**Cult Indie**\n\nThese films are made by smaller studios, but often have a more underground or cult following.\n\n##**Distributor-driven**\n\nThese films are made by distributors, who often have a more commercial or mainstream approach.\n\n**Differences from Hollywood**\n\nIndiewood films are distinct from Hollywood films in several ways. While Hollywood films are often made with a high budget and have a more mainstream appeal, Indiewood films are often made with a lower budget and have a more niche appeal. Indiewood films also often have a more experimental or avant-garde style, and may be more focused on artistic expression rather than commercial success.\n\n**List of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers**\n\nSome notable filmmakers who have worked in the Indiewood or Pre-Indiewood tradition include:\n\n##**Pre-1950s**\n\n* D.W.

Murnau\n* Orson Welles\n\n##**1950s**\n\n* Stanley Kubrick\n* Alfred Hitchcock\n* Martin Scorsese\n\n##**1960s**\n\n* Francis Ford Coppola\n* George Lucas\n* Steven Spielberg\n\n##**1970s**\n\n* Brian De Palma\n* John Cassavetes\n* Robert Altman\n\n##**1980s**\n\n* David Lynch\n* Terry Gilliam\n* Jim Jarmusch\n\n##**1990s**\n\n* Quentin Tarantino\n* Kevin Smith\n* Richard Linklater\n\n##**2000s**\n\n* Darren Aronofsky\n* Michel Gondry\n* Wes Anderson\n\n##**2010s**\n\n* Jeff Nichols\n* Ryan Coogler\n* Greta Gerwig\n\n##**2020s**\n\n* Emerald Fennell\n* Chloé Zhao\n* Jane Campion\n\n**List of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films**\n\nSome notable films made before the rise of Indiewood include:\n\n###**Pre-1950s**\n\n* \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915)\n* \"Metropolis\" (1927)\n* \"City Lights\" (1931)\n\n###**1950s**\n\n* \"Rear Window\" (1954)\n* \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955)\n* \"12 Angry Men\" (1957)\n\n###**1960s**\n\n* \"The Apartment\" (1960)\n* \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962)\n* \"Easy Rider\" (1969)\n\n###**1970s**\n\n* \"The Godfather\" (1972)\n* \"Chinatown\" (1974)\n* \"Jaws\" (1975)\n\n###**1980s**\n\n* \"Blade Runner\" (1982)\n* \"Amadeus\" (1984)\n* \"Platoon\" (1986)\n\n###**1990s**\n\n* \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994)\n* \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998)\n* \"Being John Malkovich\" (1999)\n\n###**2000s**\n\n* \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001)\n* \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004)\n* \"The Departed\" (2006)\n\n###**2010s**\n\n* \"The Social Network\" (2010)\n* \"The Tree of Life\" (2011)\n* \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013)\n\n###**2020s**\n\n* \"Parasite\" (2019)\n* \"The Lighthouse\" (2019)\n* \"Nomadland\" (2020)\n\n**List of notable and important Indiewood films**\n\nSome notable films made in the Indiewood tradition include:\n\n###**1980s**\n\n* \"Eraserhead\" (1977, but released in 1983)\n* \"This Is Spinal Tap\" (1984)\n* \"Repo Man\" (1984)\n* \"Heathers\" (1988)\n\n###**1990s**\n\n* \"Clerks\" (1994)\n* \"El Mariachi\" (1992)\n* \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992)\n* \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995)\n* \"Fargo\" (1996)\n* \"The Big Lebowski\" (1998)\n* \"Being John Malkovich\" (1999)\n\n###**2000s**\n\n* \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001)\n* \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004)\n* \"The Departed\" (2006)\n* \"There Will Be Blood\" (2007)\n* \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)\n\n###**2010s**\n\n* \"The Social Network\" (2010)\n* \"The Tree of Life\" (2011)\n* \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013)\n* \"Boyhood\" (2014)\n* \"Spotlight\" (2015)\n* \"Moonlight\" (2016)\n\n###**2020s**\n\n* \"The Lighthouse\" (2019)\n* \"Nomadland\" (2020)\n* \"Promising Young Woman\" (2020)\n\n**Notes**\n\nIndiewood films often have a distinct style or tone that sets them apart from mainstream Hollywood films.

This conflict has been characterized by a range of tactics, including censorship, control of news outlets, and the dissemination of false information through various media channels.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Doctrine**\n\nThe Russian information war against Ukraine is rooted in a broader doctrine of \"information war\" that is central to Russian military strategy. This doctrine emphasizes the importance of using information and communication technologies to shape public opinion and influence the behavior of opponents. Russian military doctrine views the dissemination of false or misleading information as a legitimate tactic in warfare, with the aim of creating confusion, undermining trust, and ultimately gaining a strategic advantage.\n\n**Reasons for the conflict**\n\n### Revanchism\n\nOne reason for the Russian information war against Ukraine is revanchism, or the desire to reassert Russian influence over its former territories and restore its dominance over Eastern Europe. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a key turning point in this process, and since then, Russia has sought to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and legitimacy as an independent state.\n\n### History of the war\n\nThe information war against Ukraine has its roots in the early 2000s, when Russia began to exert pressure on Ukraine to abandon its aspirations to join NATO and the European Union. However, the conflict escalated significantly in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and launched a proxy war in eastern Ukraine. Since then, the information war has become a key component of Russia's broader strategy to undermine Ukraine's stability and legitimacy.\n\n**Information operations**\n\n### Censorship\n\nCensorship is a key tactic in the Russian information war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have used a range of measures to suppress dissenting voices and limit access to independent media. These measures include blocking websites, imposing restrictions on social media, and prosecuting individuals who criticize the government.\n\n### Telecommunications\n\nRussian authorities have also sought to exert control over telecommunications infrastructure in Ukraine, with the aim of disrupting communications and limiting access to information. This has included the deployment of Russian-made mobile networks and the establishment of Russian-controlled telecommunications companies in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### Internet infrastructure\n\nRussia has also sought to exert control over Ukraine's internet infrastructure, with the aim of limiting access to independent media and disrupting online communications. This has included the deployment of Russian-made internet filtering technology and the establishment of Russian-controlled internet exchange points.\n\n### War propaganda\n\nWar propaganda is another key tactic in the Russian information war against Ukraine. Russian media outlets, including state-controlled television channels and newspapers, have promoted a narrative of Ukrainian aggression and Russian heroism. This narrative has been designed to justify Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and to undermine Ukraine's legitimacy as an independent state.\n\n### Control of news outlets\n\nRussian authorities have also sought to exert control over Ukrainian news outlets, with the aim of promoting a pro-Russian narrative and suppressing dissenting voices. This has included the acquisition of Ukrainian media outlets by Russian companies and the deployment of Russian journalists to work in Ukraine.\n\n### Public relations\n\nRussian authorities have also used public relations tactics to promote a positive image of Russia and to undermine Ukraine's reputation. This has included the deployment of pro-Russian activists and bloggers to promote a pro-Russian narrative on social media.\n\n### Ukraine\n\nUkrainian authorities have responded to the Russian information war by launching their own information operations to counter Russian propaganda. These operations have included the creation of a national information agency to promote a pro-Ukrainian narrative and the deployment of Ukrainian bloggers and activists to promote Ukraine's interests on social media.\n\n### Russia\n\nRussian authorities have also used their own information operations to promote a positive image of Russia and to undermine Ukraine's reputation. This has included the creation of a state-controlled media outlet to promote a pro-Russian narrative and the deployment of Russian bloggers and activists to promote Russia's interests on social media.\n\n### RT\n\nRT, a state-controlled Russian television channel, has played a key role in promoting a pro-Russian narrative and undermining Ukraine's reputation. RT has been accused of spreading disinformation and propaganda about Ukraine and has been banned in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n### Russian interference with Ukrainian media\n\nRussian authorities have also sought to exert control over Ukrainian media, with the aim of limiting access to independent information and promoting a pro-Russian narrative. This has included the deployment of Russian-made filtering technology to block access to independent media and the establishment of Russian-controlled media outlets in Ukraine.\n\n**Methods and resources**\n\n### Disinformation\n\nDisinformation is a key tactic in the Russian information war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have used a range of measures to spread false or misleading information about Ukraine, including the use of fake news outlets, social media bots, and propaganda videos.\n\n#### Falsehoods and adamant denials\n\nRussian authorities have also used a range of measures to spread falsehoods and adamant denials about Ukraine. This has included the denial of Russian involvement in the conflict, the denial of Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the promotion of false narratives about Ukrainian aggression against Russia.\n\n##### 2014\n\nIn 2014, Russian authorities spread a range of false and misleading information about Ukraine, including the claim that Ukraine was planning to invade Crimea and the claim that Ukrainian nationalists were engaged in violent attacks against Russian-speaking citizens in eastern Ukraine.\n\n##### Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n\nIn 2014, Russian authorities also spread false and misleading information about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, including the claim that Ukraine was responsible for the attack and the claim that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian Buk missile system.\n\n##### 2022\n\nIn 2022, Russian authorities spread a range of false and misleading information about Ukraine, including the claim that Ukraine was planning to use a dirty bomb and the claim that Ukraine was engaging in genocide against Russian-speaking citizens in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### Tropes\n\nRussian authorities have also used a range of tropes to promote a pro-Russian narrative and undermine Ukraine's reputation. These tropes have included the use of imagery of Ukrainian nationalists as neo-Nazis and the use of imagery of Ukrainian protesters as violent hooligans.\n\n### Social media\n\nSocial media has played a key role in the Russian information war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have used social media to spread false and misleading information about Ukraine and to promote a pro-Russian narrative. Ukrainian authorities have also used social media to promote a pro-Ukrainian narrative and to counter Russian propaganda.\n\n#### Access to social media\n\nAccess to social media has also been a key issue in the Russian information war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have sought to limit access to social media in Ukraine, with the aim of limiting access to independent information and promoting a pro-Russian narrative. Ukrainian authorities have also sought to limit access to social media in Russia, with the aim of limiting access to pro-Russian propaganda and promoting a pro-Ukrainian narrative.\n\n#### Attempts to censor Russian Wikipedia\n\nRussian authorities have also sought to censor Russian Wikipedia, with the aim of limiting access to independent information and promoting a pro-Russian narrative. This has included the blocking of Russian Wikipedia in Russia and the establishment of a Russian-controlled version of Wikipedia.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 2014\n\n#### January\n\nIn January 2014, Russian authorities launched a series of information operations to undermine Ukraine's stability and legitimacy.

From ancient myths and legends to modern-day novels and films, fantasy has evolved over time, reflecting the changing values and concerns of society. This article will explore the development of fantasy, from its early roots in romance and mythology to its modern manifestations in literature, art, and popular culture.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy is often associated with the fantastical and supernatural, it is distinct from earlier forms of literature and art that also featured magical or mythical elements. In ancient Greece and Rome, for example, mythology and folklore were an integral part of everyday life, but they were not necessarily presented as separate from reality. Similarly, in medieval Europe, stories of knights and chivalry were often infused with magical and supernatural elements, but they were still seen as part of a larger moral and didactic framework.\n\nIn contrast, fantasy as a distinct literary and artistic genre emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, with a focus on creating imaginary worlds and stories that were self-contained and separate from the real world. This shift was influenced by the rise of Romanticism, which emphasized the importance of imagination and the individual's subjective experience.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\n### Romances\n\nThe development of fantasy as a distinct genre can be traced back to the romances of the 18th and 19th centuries. Romances were a type of narrative that emphasized the marvelous and the extraordinary, often featuring magical or supernatural elements. Works such as John Keats's _Endymion_ (1818) and William Morris's _The Well at the World's End_ (1896) showcased the beauty and power of imagination, but they were still rooted in a realist tradition.\n\nRomances often featured fantastical elements, such as magical creatures, mythical beings, and enchanted lands, but they were not necessarily meant to be taken literally. Instead, they were used to explore themes and ideas that were considered too fantastical or impractical for realist literature. This approach allowed authors to explore the limits of reality and the imagination, creating new and innovative worlds that were both fantastical and coherent.\n\n### The Enlightenment\n\nThe Enlightenment period saw a significant shift in the way people thought about the world and the role of imagination in it. As the scientific revolution gathered pace, people began to view the world as a rational and orderly place, governed by laws and principles that could be understood and explained. This led to a growing skepticism about the supernatural and the fantastical, as well as a increasing emphasis on reason and evidence-based thinking.\n\nHowever, this did not mean that fantasy disappeared entirely. Instead, it was reimagined and reinterpreted in ways that were more in line with the values and concerns of the Enlightenment. Works such as Jonathan Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_ (1726) and Voltaire's _Candide_ (1759) used satire and irony to critique the excesses of the aristocracy and the role of the imagination in shaping our understanding of the world.\n\n### Romanticism\n\nRomanticism was a cultural and artistic movement that emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, emphasizing the importance of imagination, emotion, and individualism. Romantics saw the world as a place of beauty and wonder, full of mystery and awe-inspiring landscapes. They believed that the imagination was a powerful tool for exploring the human experience and creating new and innovative works of art.\n\nRomanticism had a profound impact on the development of fantasy, as it emphasized the importance of imagination and the individual's subjective experience. Works such as Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ (1818) and Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ (1897) showcased the power of the imagination to create new and terrifying worlds, while authors such as Charles Dickens and the Brontë sisters explored the complexities of the human experience through their fiction.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\n### Pre-Tolkien\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fantasy began to take on a new form, with the rise of science fiction and the emergence of new technologies such as cinema and radio. Works such as H.G. Wells's _The Time Machine_ (1895) and E.M. Forster's _The Machine Stops_ (1909) explored the possibilities of science fiction, while authors such as Lord Dunsany and Hope Mirrlees created new and imaginative worlds through their fiction.\n\nHowever, fantasy as we know it today began to take shape with the emergence of J.R.R. Tolkien's _The Hobbit_ (1937) and _The Lord of the Rings_ (1954-1955). Tolkien's work was a game-changer in the world of fantasy, as it created a richly detailed and immersive world that was both recognizable and yet fantastical. His use of language, his creation of new mythologies and histories, and his emphasis on the importance of the individual's role in shaping the world around them all helped to establish fantasy as a distinct and vibrant genre.\n\n### Tolkien\n\nTolkien's influence on the development of fantasy cannot be overstated. His work has had a profound impact on the genre, inspiring countless authors and artists to create their own imaginative worlds and stories. Tolkien's use of language, his creation of new mythologies and histories, and his emphasis on the importance of the individual's role in shaping the world around them all helped to establish fantasy as a distinct and vibrant genre.\n\nTolkien's work also explored the complexities of the human experience, exploring themes such as prejudice, power, and the corrupting influence of desire. His use of allegory and symbolism added depth and complexity to his stories, making them both entertaining and thought-provoking.\n\n### Post-Tolkien\n\nSince Tolkien's work, fantasy has continued to evolve and expand, with the emergence of new authors, new technologies, and new approaches to storytelling. The rise of science fiction, the emergence of new technologies such as the internet and social media, and the increasing diversity of the global population have all contributed to the growth and diversification of the fantasy genre.\n\nAuthors such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Neil Gaiman, and Patrick Rothfuss have created new and imaginative worlds, exploring themes and ideas that are both fantastical and relevant to our own world. The rise of genre-bending and hybrid forms of fiction, such as urban fantasy and science fantasy, has also expanded the possibilities of the fantasy genre, allowing authors to create new and innovative works that blend elements of different genres.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of fantasy is a complex and multifaceted story, spanning thousands of years and reflecting the changing values and concerns of society. From its early roots in romance and mythology to its modern manifestations in literature, art, and popular culture, fantasy has evolved over time, reflecting our deepest hopes and fears, our greatest aspirations and our darkest nightmares.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_fantasy\" following this outline:\n\n#Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n#Development of fantasy\n##Romances\n##The Enlightenment\n##Romanticism\n#Modern fantasy\n##Pre-Tolkien\n##Tolkien\n##Post-Tolkien\n#References\n##Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is contested by national teams, and the tournament is held every four years. The WBC was first held in 2006, and it has since become one of the most prestigious international sporting events.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of creating an international baseball tournament dates back to the 1930s. However, it wasn't until the 1990s that the concept gained momentum. In 1997, the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) formed a committee to develop a proposal for an international tournament. The committee presented its proposal to the IBAF Congress in 1998, and the tournament was officially approved in 1999.\n\nThe first WBC was held in 2006, and it was a groundbreaking event that brought together the best baseball players from around the world. The tournament was a huge success, with a total attendance of over 700,000 people. Since then, the WBC has grown in popularity, with the 2023 tournament attracting a record-breaking audience of over 1.2 million spectators.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe first two WBC tournaments were won by Japan, who dominated the competition with their highly skilled players and strategic team management. In 2006, Japan defeated Cuba in the final, winning the championship with a score of 10-6. The team was led by players such as Daisuke Matsuzaka, who would later become a key figure in the Boston Red Sox's 2007 World Series victory.\n\nIn the 2009 WBC, Japan repeated their success, defeating South Korea in the final with a score of 5-3. The team was again led by Matsuzaka, as well as other talented players such as Ichiro Suzuki andHideki Okajima.\n\n### 2013: Direct qualification and \"Plátano Power\"\n\nThe 2013 WBC was notable for the introduction of direct qualification, where teams earned spots in the tournament based on their performance in the previous edition. This led to a stronger field of teams, including the Dominican Republic, who were inspired by their \"Plátano Power\" nickname.\n\nThe Dominican Republic made it to the final, where they faced Japan. However, they were defeated by a score of 3-0, with the Japanese team's pitching staff dominating the competition.\n\n### 2017: American redemption\n\nThe 2017 WBC was seen as an opportunity for the United States to redeem themselves after their disappointing performance in the 2013 tournament. The team was led by players such as Bryce Harper, Mike Trout, and Clayton Kershaw, who were all World Series champions with their respective teams.\n\nIn the final, the United States faced Puerto Rico, who had been one of the top teams in the tournament. However, the Americans emerged victorious, winning the championship with a score of 8-0.\n\n### 2023: \"Baseball's already won\"\n\nThe 2023 WBC was notable for its unique format, which featured a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout stage. The tournament was also marked by the presence of several high-profile players, including Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge.\n\nIn the final, Japan faced the United States, who were seeking to defend their title. However, the Japanese team emerged victorious, winning the championship with a score of 3-2.\n\n### 2026 tournament\n\nThe next WBC is scheduled to take place in 2026, with the host country to be determined by the WBSC. The tournament is expected to feature a similar format to the 2023 edition, with a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout stage.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe WBC is a 16-team tournament, with each team participating in a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout stage. The group stage features four groups of four teams each, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the knockout stage.\n\nThe knockout stage consists of a best-of-three series between the top two teams from each group, followed by a best-of-three series between the winners of each semifinal. The tournament is played in a single-elimination format, with the winner of each series advancing to the next round.\n\n**Participation**\n\nThe WBC features a mix of teams from different regions of the world. The Americas are represented by teams from the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.\n\nAsia is represented by teams from Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Europe is represented by teams from the Netherlands, Italy, and Israel.\n\nAfrica is represented by teams from South Africa and Israel. Oceania is represented by teams from Australia and New Zealand.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe WBC trophy is awarded to the winning team, and it is considered one of the most prestigious international sporting trophies. The trophy is a gold-plated crystal globe, with the WBSC logo engraved on the side.\n\n**Broadcasting and promotion**\n\nThe WBC is broadcast in several countries around the world, including the United States, Japan, and the Dominican Republic. The tournament is also promoted through social media and other online platforms.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nThe WBC has consistently drawn large crowds throughout its history. The 2023 tournament attracted a record-breaking audience of over 1.2 million spectators.\n\n**Venues**\n\nThe WBC is played in various stadiums around the world, including the Tokyo Dome in Japan, the Marlins Park in Miami, and the Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Performance of nations\n\nThe WBC has been dominated by a few select nations, including Japan, the United States, and the Dominican Republic.\n\nJapan has won the most WBC titles, with three championships in 2006, 2009, and 2023.\n\nThe United States has won two WBC titles, in 2017 and 2023.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has won one WBC title, in 2013.\n\n### Debut of national teams\n\nSeveral national teams have made their WBC debut in recent years, including the Netherlands, Israel, and South Africa.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe WBC has been a highly successful international sporting event, with a strong following and a high level of competition.

This concept is distinct from other forms of substitution, such as limited substitution or substitution only to replace injured players.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe concept of free substitution has been adopted in various forms of sports, allowing teams to adjust their strategies and tactics in real-time. This strategy has both advantages and disadvantages, and its implementation can significantly impact the pace and intensity of the game. In this article, we will explore sports that allow free substitution, the benefits and drawbacks of this strategy, and the different variations of substitution rules found in various sports.\n\n**Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play**\n\nSome sports, such as basketball and soccer, allow teams to make unlimited substitutions during live play. This means that players can be substituted in and out of the game at any time, without any restrictions or limitations. This strategy allows teams to adjust their lineups and tactics in real-time, responding to the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents.\n\nIn basketball, for example, teams can substitute players during any stoppage in play, as long as the substitution is made through the designated substitution area. This allows coaches to make strategic substitutions, such as bringing in a fresh player to replace a tired one, or switching out a player who is struggling to make a change in the game's momentum.\n\nIn soccer, teams can also make substitutions during live play, as long as the substitution is made before the next stoppage in play. This allows teams to make tactical changes, such as bringing in a player with a different skill set or adjusting the formation to counter the opponent's strategy.\n\n**Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only**\n\nOther sports, such as hockey and baseball, allow teams to make unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play, but not during live play. This means that players can be substituted in and out of the game only when the play is stopped, such as during timeouts, injuries, or between periods.\n\nIn hockey, for example, teams can substitute players during stoppages in play, such as between periods or during timeouts. However, players cannot be substituted during live play, unless it is to replace an injured player. This allows teams to make strategic substitutions, but also maintains the intensity and pace of the game.\n\nIn baseball, teams can substitute players during stoppages in play, such as during pitching changes or between innings. However, players cannot be substituted during live play, unless it is to replace an injured player. This allows teams to make strategic substitutions, but also maintains the pace and flow of the game.\n\n**Sports with limited substitution**\n\nSome sports, such as rugby and American football, allow a limited number of substitutions during the game. This means that teams can make a certain number of substitutions, but not an unlimited number.\n\nIn rugby, for example, teams are allowed to make a maximum of seven substitutions during the game. This means that teams must carefully plan their substitutions, making the most of the limited number of opportunities available.\n\nIn American football, teams are allowed to make a maximum of three substitutions per quarter. This means that teams must carefully plan their substitutions, making the most of the limited number of opportunities available.\n\n**Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions**\n\nSome sports, such as tennis and golf, allow a limited number of substitutions, but the number is not strictly limited. In tennis, for example, players can substitute their racket or shoes during a match, but the number of substitutions is not strictly limited.\n\nIn golf, players can substitute their clubs or balls during a round, but the number of substitutions is not strictly limited. However, players are not allowed to substitute their scorecard or make any changes to their score during the round.\n\n**Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players**\n\nSome sports, such as boxing and mixed martial arts, only allow substitution to replace injured players. This means that players can only be substituted into the game if they are injured, and not for any other reason.\n\nIn boxing, for example, if a fighter is injured during the bout, they can be substituted with a replacement fighter. However, this can only be done if the injury is severe enough to prevent the fighter from continuing the bout.\n\nIn mixed martial arts, if a fighter is injured during the bout, they can be substituted with a replacement fighter. However, this can only be done if the injury is severe enough to prevent the fighter from continuing the bout.\n\n**Sports with mixed or hybrid systems**\n\nSome sports, such as cricket and field hockey, have mixed or hybrid systems of substitution. This means that teams can make unlimited substitutions during certain periods of the game, but limited substitutions during other periods.\n\nIn cricket, for example, teams can make unlimited substitutions during the innings, but limited substitutions during the fielding. In field hockey, teams can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play, but limited substitutions during live play.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Substitution (sports)\n* Injury\n* Timeout\n* Period (sports)\n* Quarter (sports)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The rules of substitution vary between different sports and leagues.\n* The number of substitutions allowed and the timing of substitutions can impact the pace and intensity of the game.\n* Substitution can be used to adjust the strategy and tactics of the game, but it can also be used to exploit the weaknesses of the opponent.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike, which lasted for several months, was the largest strike in the history of the entertainment industry.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was the culmination of years of tension between the union and the industry's major studios and networks. The strike was sparked by a range of issues, including fair compensation for streaming content, residuals for reuse of existing content, and protections for performers' personal and professional well-being. The strike had significant implications for the entertainment industry, impacting not only the actors and performers but also the production companies, studios, and networks.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Unionization in Hollywood**\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was founded in 1933, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) was established in 1952. The two unions merged in 2012 to form SAG-AFTRA, which represents over 160,000 members in the entertainment industry. SAG-AFTRA is one of the largest and most influential labor unions in the United States, with members working in film, television, radio, and digital media.\n\n### **Pre-strike activity**\n\nIn the years leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA had been negotiating with the AMPTP over a new collective bargaining agreement. The two sides had been at odds over issues such as fair compensation for streaming content, residuals for reuse of existing content, and protections for performers' personal and professional well-being. The negotiations had been tense, with the union and the industry's major studios and networks failing to reach an agreement.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### **July**\n\nIn July 2023, SAG-AFTRA announced that it would be holding a national convention to discuss the proposed collective bargaining agreement with the AMPTP. The convention was attended by over 1,000 members, who voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if the negotiations failed.\n\n### **August**\n\nIn August 2023, the negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP broke down, with the union announcing that it would be going on strike. The strike began on August 12, 2023, with thousands of performers and actors walking off the job.\n\n### **September**\n\nIn September 2023, the strike continued, with SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside studios and networks across the country. The union also launched a social media campaign to raise awareness about the issues at stake in the strike.\n\n### **October**\n\nIn October 2023, the AMPTP made a counteroffer to SAG-AFTRA, which the union rejected. The negotiations continued, but the strike remained in place.\n\n### **November**\n\nIn November 2023, the strike began to impact the production of new content, with several major studios and networks announcing delays or cancellations of upcoming projects.\n\n### **December**\n\nIn December 2023, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP reached a tentative agreement, which the union's members voted to approve. The strike ended on December 20, 2023.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### **Locations**\n\nThe strike was marked by picketing and demonstrations outside studios and networks in major cities across the country, including Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago.\n\n### **Media executives' response**\n\nThe major studios and networks responded to the strike by announcing delays or cancellations of upcoming projects. They also launched a public relations campaign to downplay the impact of the strike and to portray the union as unreasonable.\n\n### **Politicians' response**\n\nSeveral politicians, including members of Congress and state legislatures, weighed in on the strike. Some expressed support for the union and its demands, while others criticized the strike as unnecessary and damaging to the economy.\n\n### **Other unions' response**\n\nOther labor unions, including the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, expressed support for SAG-AFTRA and its demands. They also participated in solidarity actions and demonstrations.\n\n### **Other organizations' response**\n\nSeveral industry organizations, including the Motion Picture Association of America and the National Association of Broadcasters, criticized the strike and portrayed the union as unreasonable. They also launched a public relations campaign to downplay the impact of the strike.\n\n### **Impact**\n\nThe strike had significant implications for the entertainment industry, impacting not only the actors and performers but also the production companies, studios, and networks. The strike led to delays and cancellations of upcoming projects, and it had a negative impact on the economy.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe strike ended on December 20, 2023, with SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP reaching a tentative agreement.

Born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, Hersh has spent over six decades covering many of the most significant events of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nHersh grew up in a Jewish family in Chicago and developed an interest in journalism from an early age. He attended South Shore High School and later enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he studied mathematics. However, Hersh soon became disillusioned with the university's strict academic environment and dropped out. He then joined the US Army in 1958, serving two years as a cook in the infantry. After being honorably discharged, Hersh returned to Chicago and began working as a journalist.\n\n**Newspaper career**\n\nHersh started his journalism career at the _South End News_ in Chicago, where he covered local politics and crime. In 1963, he joined the _New York City Tribune_ and later the _Baltimore Sun_, where he covered the police beat. Hersh's big break came in 1966 when he joined the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ and began covering the Vietnam War. His reporting from Vietnam earned him a reputation as a fearless and meticulous investigative journalist.\n\n**My Lai massacre**\n\nIn 1969, Hersh's reporting on the My Lai massacre, a brutal atrocity committed by American soldiers in Vietnam, brought him international attention. His investigation, which involved interviewing eyewitnesses and gathering documents, revealed the extent of the massacre and exposed the US military's attempts to cover it up. The story, which was published in the _New York Times_ and _Look_ magazine, sparked widespread outrage and helped to galvanize opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\n**The New York Times**\n\nIn 1972, Hersh joined the _New York Times_ as a senior investigative reporter, where he continued to cover the military and politics. His reporting on the Pentagon Papers, a secret study of the Vietnam War, was instrumental in bringing the story to light. Hersh's investigation into the CIA's secret war in Laos and the agency's ties to drug trafficking also made headlines.\n\n**Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s**\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh wrote several investigative books that exposed government wrongdoing and corruption. His book _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983) examined the role of Henry Kissinger in the Nixon administration and revealed the extent of Kissinger's involvement in the bombing of Cambodia. _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy_ (1991) exposed the Israeli nuclear program and its implications for US foreign policy.\n\n**Later investigations**\n\nIn the 2000s, Hersh continued to investigate government wrongdoing and corruption. His reporting on the Iraq War and the Abu Ghraib scandal, which involved the torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners, brought him widespread attention. Hersh's investigation into the Iran nuclear program and the US government's secret war in Iran also made headlines. His reporting on the Syrian chemical attacks and the US government's response to the crisis also raised important questions about US foreign policy.\n\n**Killing of Osama bin Laden**\n\nIn 2011, Hersh reported on the US Navy SEALs' raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Hersh's investigation revealed that the US government had been aware of the raid's details in advance and had deliberately exaggerated the role of Pakistani intelligence in the operation. Hersh's story sparked controversy and raised questions about the US government's handling of the bin Laden raid.\n\n**Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine**\n\nIn 2022, Hersh reported on the Nord Stream pipeline, a natural gas pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany. Hersh's investigation revealed that the US government had secretly worked with Ukraine to sabotage the pipeline, which was seen as a threat to European energy security. Hersh's story sparked controversy and raised questions about the US government's role in the sabotage.\n\n**Other statements**\n\nHersh has given several speeches and interviews in which he has discussed his reporting and the challenges he has faced as an investigative journalist. In a 2016 speech, Hersh criticized the Obama administration for its handling of the bin Laden raid and accused the government of exaggerating the role of Pakistani intelligence in the operation. In a 2020 interview, Hersh discussed his reporting on the Iran nuclear program and the US government's secret war in Iran.\n\n**Murder of Seth Rich**\n\nIn a 2016 speech, Hersh speculated that the murder of Seth Rich, a young Democratic National Committee staffer, was linked to the hacking of the DNC's email system. Hersh's theory, which was later repeated by other conspiracy theorists, was met with skepticism by many experts and journalists.\n\n**Pat Nixon abuse**\n\nIn a 1973 article, Hersh reported on allegations of abuse by Pat Nixon, the wife of President Richard Nixon. Hersh's investigation revealed that Pat Nixon had been criticized by her husband and other government officials for her behavior, including her alleged use of cocaine and her involvement in fundraising activities.\n\n**Use of anonymous sources**\n\nHersh has been accused of relying too heavily on anonymous sources in his reporting. In a 2015 article, Hersh reported on allegations of wrongdoing by the US government's secret intelligence agencies, relying on sources who claimed to have knowledge of the agencies' activities. However, Hersh's sources were later criticized for their credibility, and some experts questioned the accuracy of Hersh's reporting.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nHersh is married to Elizabeth Saft, and they have two daughters, Lisa and Sarah. Hersh has been a long-time resident of Washington, D.C. and has been known to be fiercely critical of government secrecy and corruption.\n\n**Awards and honors**\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including two Pulitzer Prizes, three Polk Awards, and two George Polk Awards for Investigative Reporting. He has also been awarded the National Press Club's Kennedy Award and the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award.\n\n**Publications**\n\nHersh has written several books and articles on politics and foreign policy. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* _My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath_ (1970)\n* _Cover-Up: The Army vs. the People: The Suppression of Truth in the Investigation of the Death of Allende's Chile and the Making of the Chilean Military Coup_ (1973)\n* _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983)\n* _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy_ (1991)\n* _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004)\n* _The Dark Side of Camelot_ (1997)\n* _The Syrian Option: The Rise and Fall of the Kadafi Regime_ (2015)\n\n**References**\n\n* Hersh, S.
