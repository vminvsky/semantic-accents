The song has since become one of Bush's most popular and enduring works, gaining significant attention and acclaim from critics and audiences alike.\n\n**Music and lyrics**\n\nThe song's lyrics and music were inspired by Bush's fascination with the idea of a person switching lives with someone else. The title phrase \"running up that hill\" is a metaphor for the idea of climbing to a different level of understanding and experience. Bush has stated that the song was written during a period of personal crisis, and that the lyrics reflect her feelings of frustration and desperation.\n\nThe song's music is characterized by its complex, layered instrumentation and Bush's distinctive vocal style. The track features a prominent synthesizer riff, accompanied by driving drums and a haunting bass line. Bush's vocals are delivered in a distinctive, emotive style, conveying the sense of urgency and desperation that underlies the song's lyrics.\n\n**Recording**\n\nThe song was recorded at Bush's home studio in London, using a mixture of traditional and electronic instruments. The track's distinctive synthesizer sound was created using a combination of a Yamaha CS-80 and a Jupiter-8. Bush has stated that she spent several months working on the song's arrangement and production, experimenting with different instrumental textures and effects.\n\n**Music video**\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Tim Pope, features Bush performing the song in a series of surreal and dreamlike environments. The video opens with Bush singing in a desolate, industrial landscape, before she is transported to a series of increasingly fantastical settings, including a forest, a beach, and a futuristic cityscape. The video's visual style is characterized by its use of vivid color and innovative special effects, which add to the song's sense of wonder and enchantment.\n\n**Release**\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was released in June 1985 as the lead single from _Hounds of Love_. The song was a major commercial success, reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart and becoming one of the best-selling singles of the year. The song's success helped establish Bush as a major force in the music industry, and paved the way for her subsequent releases.\n\n**2012 Olympics remix**\n\nIn 2012, Bush re-recorded \"Running Up That Hill\" for the London Olympics, with a new arrangement and production. The song was released as a digital single, and featured a new vocal performance from Bush, accompanied by a reworked instrumental arrangement. The song was used as the theme music for the Olympics' opening ceremony, and was performed live by Bush during the event.\n\n**2022 revival and Stranger Things**\n\nIn 2022, \"Running Up That Hill\" experienced a significant resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to its inclusion in the Netflix series _Stranger Things_. The song was featured in the show's fourth season, which premiered in May 2022. The show's creators had chosen the song for its nostalgic value and its sense of timelessness, which they felt would be an ideal fit for the show's retro aesthetic.\n\n**Critical response**\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the song's innovative production, Bush's distinctive vocal style, and the song's memorable melody. The song has been named one of the greatest songs of all time by various publications, including _NME_, _Rolling Stone_, and _Pitchfork_.\n\n**Live performances**\n\nBush has performed \"Running Up That Hill\" live on several occasions, including during her 2014 tour, which celebrated the 30th anniversary of _Hounds of Love_. The song has also been included in Bush's setlists for her subsequent tours, including her 2019 North American tour.\n\n**Cover versions**\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has been covered by several other artists, including Placebo, who recorded a version for their 2009 album _Battle for the Sun_. The song has also been covered by artists such as Florence + The Machine and Lorde, who have both cited Bush as an influence.\n\n**Track listing and formats**\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was released on various formats, including 7-inch single, 12-inch single, and cassette single. The song was also included on the album _Hounds of Love_, which was released in June 1985.\n\n**Personnel**\n\n* Kate Bush: vocals, synthesizers, piano\n* Del Palmer: bass\n* Jon Button: guitar\n* Paddy Bush: guitar, mandolin\n* Duncan Mackay: keyboards\n* Jon May: drums\n\n**Charts**\n\n* UK Singles Chart: number three\n* US Billboard Hot 100: number 99\n\n**Certifications**\n\n* BPI: gold\n* RIAA: gold\n\n**References**\n\n* _Hounds of Love_ (album)\n* _Stranger Things_ (TV series)\n* _London Olympics_ (2012)\n* _NME_\n* _Rolling Stone_\n* _Pitchfork_", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Running_Up_That_Hill\" following this outline:\n\n#Music and lyrics\n#Recording\n#Music video\n#Release\n#2012 Olympics remix\n#2022 revival and Stranger Things\n#Critical response\n#Live performances\n#Cover versions\n#Track listing and formats\n#Personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The order of the draft was determined by the teams' win-loss records from the previous season, with the worst team selecting first and the Super Bowl champion selecting last. The Kansas City Chiefs, who won Super Bowl LVI, had the last pick in the first round.\n\nThe first player selected in the draft was Travon Walker, an edge rusher from the University of Georgia, who was chosen by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the first overall pick. The Jaguars had traded up from the 25th overall pick to select Walker, giving up their 2022 first-round pick, a 2022 second-round pick, and a 2023 first-round pick to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe first quarterback selected in the draft was Malik Willis, who was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 20th overall pick. Willis was a transfer from the University of Liberty and was considered one of the most athletic quarterbacks in the draft.\n\nThe first running back selected in the draft was Jahmyr Gibbs, who was chosen by the Detroit Lions with the 12th overall pick. Gibbs was a junior at Georgia and was considered one of the top running backs in the draft.\n\n# Notable undrafted players\n\nDespite not being selected in the draft, several players became notable contributors to their respective teams. One of the most notable undrafted players was Kylin Hill, a running back who signed with the New Orleans Saints as an undrafted free agent. Hill had a breakout season, rushing for 1,015 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\nAnother notable undrafted player was Matt Corral, a quarterback who signed with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent. Corral had a solid rookie season, throwing for 1,641 yards and 9 touchdowns.\n\n# Trades\n\nSeveral trades were made during the 2022 NFL Draft. The most notable trade was between the New England Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars, in which the Jaguars traded up from the 25th overall pick to select Travon Walker.\n\nThe Patriots also traded up from the 29th overall pick to select Cole Strange, an offensive guard from the University of Chattanooga.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys traded up from the 24th overall pick to select Tyler Smith, a tackle from the University of Tulsa.\n\n# 2020 Resolution JC-2A selections\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft also included selections from players who were signed as undrafted free agents in 2020, but were not on an NFL roster at the end of the 2021 season. These players were selected by their respective teams as part of the 2022 NFL Draft.\n\nOne of the most notable selections from this group was Tylan Wallace, a wide receiver who was signed by the Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 2020. Wallace was selected by the Ravens with the 195th overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was the first draft to feature a virtual presence due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The draft was held in person, but teams were able to participate remotely if they chose to.\n\nThe draft also featured a new rule change, which allowed teams to trade up in the draft using future draft picks.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe 2022 NFL Draft was a highly successful event, with many talented players being selected by their respective teams. The draft featured several notable trades, including a trade between the New England Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars that sent Travon Walker to the Jaguars with the first overall pick.\n\n## Selections by NCAA conference\n\n* ACC: 67 players selected\n* Big 12: 46 players selected\n* Big Ten: 44 players selected\n* Pac-12: 31 players selected\n* SEC: 58 players selected\n\n## Colleges with multiple draft selections\n\n* Alabama: 11 players selected\n* Georgia: 9 players selected\n* Ohio State: 7 players selected\n* USC: 6 players selected\n* Clemson: 6 players selected\n\n## Selections by position\n\n* Wide Receiver: 105 players selected\n* Defensive Back: 89 players selected\n* Linebacker: 74 players selected\n* Safety: 63 players selected\n* Cornerback: 56 players selected", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_NFL_draft\" following this outline:\n\n#Host city\n#Player selections\n#Notable undrafted players\n#Trades\n#2020 Resolution JC-2A selections\n#Notes\n#Summary\n##Selections by NCAA conference\n##Colleges with multiple draft selections\n##Selections by position\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case is a result of Trump's alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nBackground\n\n# Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n\nThe federal prosecution of Donald Trump stems from allegations that he and his associates engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. This effort involved spreading false information about election fraud, pressure on government officials to change the outcome of the election, and ultimately, the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol.\n\n# January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n\nThe January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol was a violent insurrection that sought to prevent the certification of Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. The attack resulted in the deaths of five people, injuries to over 140 police officers, and damage to the Capitol building. The incident sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability, leading to a series of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nOriginal Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn February 2, 2023, a grand jury indicted Donald Trump and several associates on charges of election obstruction. The indictment alleged that Trump and his associates conspired to defraud the United States by spreading false information about election fraud and attempting to pressure government officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\nThe arraignment took place on February 27, 2023, at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nSuperseding Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn April 18, 2023, the DOJ filed a superseding indictment against Trump and his associates, adding new charges of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\nThe superseding indictment alleged that Trump and his associates engaged in a concerted effort to obstruct the certification of the presidential election results by spreading false information about election fraud and pressuring government officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\nThe superseding arraignment took place on May 8, 2023, at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nStatements in the Indictment\n\n## Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment alleged that Donald Trump and his associates made false statements about the 2020 presidential election, claiming that it was rigged and that the outcome was invalid.\n\n## Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his associates conspired to defraud the United States by spreading false information about election fraud and attempting to pressure government officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## Further Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his associates used various tactics to spread their false information, including social media platforms, the transmission of fake news articles, and the coordination with other individuals and organizations.\n\n## Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his associates conspired to obstruct an official proceeding by attempting to prevent the certification of the presidential election results.\n\n## Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his associates obstructed an official proceeding by spreading false information about election fraud and pressuring government officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n## Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n\nThe indictment alleged that Trump and his associates conspired to deprive individuals of their right to vote and their right to participate in the electoral process.\n\nCo-conspirators\n\nThe indictment named several individuals as co-conspirators, including:\n\n* Roger Stone, a longtime associate of Trump\n* Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Trump\n* Mike Flynn, a former national security advisor to Trump\n* Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer who represented Trump\n* Sidney Powell, a lawyer who represented Trump\n\nPretrial Proceedings\n\n## Initial Timetable\n\nThe initial pretrial timetable was set for June 1, 2023, with the trial expected to begin on July 15, 2023.\n\n## Protective Orders and Security Measures\n\nThe court issued protective orders and security measures to ensure the safety of the parties involved in the case, including Trump and his associates.\n\n## Other Pre-trial Motions\n\nThe defense team filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion to dismiss the indictment on grounds of double jeopardy and a motion to exclude evidence obtained through searches of Trump's properties.\n\n## Immunity Dispute\n\nThe prosecution and the defense team disputed the issue of immunity for several individuals, including Trump's associates. The dispute resulted in several appeals and hearings.\n\n### Appeals\n\nThe prosecution appealed a decision by the trial court to grant immunity to several individuals, including Trump's associates. The appeal was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n### Proceedings Resulting from the Immunity Decision\n\nThe trial court held several hearings to determine the scope of immunity for the individuals involved in the case.\n\n## Post-immunity Timetable\n\nAfter the immunity dispute was resolved, the pretrial timetable was revised to reflect the new developments.\n\nPotential Witnesses and Evidence\n\n## Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution team identified several potential witnesses and pieces of evidence, including:\n\n* Testimony from government officials and witnesses who were present at the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol\n* Evidence of Trump's communications with his associates and other individuals involved in the case\n* Records of Trump's financial transactions and business dealings\n\n## Defense\n\nThe defense team identified several potential witnesses and pieces of evidence, including:\n\n* Testimony from Trump and his associates\n* Evidence of Trump's innocence and lack of involvement in the alleged conspiracy\n* Records of Trump's public statements and actions that were not related to the alleged conspiracy\n\nReactions\n\n## Defendant\n\nDonald Trump and his lawyers have consistently denied the allegations and have claimed that the indictment is a politically motivated attack on the president.\n\n## Republicans in Support of the Indictment\n\nSeveral Republican politicians and commentators have expressed support for the indictment, arguing that Trump's actions were a threat to democracy and the rule of law.\n\n## Republicans Opposed to the Indictment\n\nSeveral Republican politicians and commentators have expressed opposition to the indictment, arguing that it is a partisan attack on Trump and that the allegations are unfounded.\n\n## Democrats in Support of the Indictment\n\nSeveral Democratic politicians and commentators have expressed support for the indictment, arguing that Trump's actions were a threat to democracy and the rule of law.\n\nSee Also\n\n* United States v.

The college has a rich history, with its origins dating back to a chantry founded by a local landowner. Over the centuries, Wye College has evolved to become a prominent institution for agricultural education and research.\n\nHistory\n\n### Chantry\n\nThe history of Wye College begins with the establishment of a chantry, a type of Christian house, in the 13th century. The chantry was founded by a local landowner, and it is believed that the site was chosen for its strategic location near the River Stour. The chantry was dedicated to the service of a local parish church and provided a place for prayers and charitable activities.\n\n### After abolition\n\nDuring the English Reformation, the chantry was abolished, and the site was seized by the crown. The land was subsequently sold to a local family, who built a new house on the site. This house remained in the family for several generations, with the family members contributing to the local community and supporting the nearby parish church.\n\n### Lady Joanna Thornhill School\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the site of the former chantry was transformed into a boarding school for girls.

The monument is a 19th-century structure that stands over 21 feet tall, weighing over 119 tons, and is surrounded by a series of cryptic inscriptions that have sparked intense debate and controversy.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were erected in 1979 on a hill overlooking the town of Elberton, Georgia. The monument was commissioned by a group of individuals who wished to remain anonymous, and its purpose has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Over the years, the Guidestones have become a source of fascination for tourists and locals alike, with many regarding them as a mysterious and enigmatic structure.\n\n**History**\n\n#### **Construction**\n\nThe construction of the Georgia Guidestones was a complex process that involved the collaboration of several individuals and companies. The monument's design was created by a team of architects and engineers, who incorporated a series of intricate carvings and inscriptions into the stone. The construction of the Guidestones was undertaken by a local company, which quarried the granite from a nearby site and transported it to the construction site. The process took several months to complete, with the monument being officially dedicated in March 1980.\n\n#### **Reaction**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones generated a significant amount of interest and controversy upon their completion. Many local residents were puzzled by the monument's cryptic inscriptions and its seemingly esoteric purpose. Some individuals interpreted the Guidestones as a form of modern-day Stonehenge, while others saw them as a symbol of a New World Order. The monument's anonymous sponsors further fueled the speculation, with many wondering about the identity and motivations of those behind the project.\n\n#### **Destruction**\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were intentionally destroyed by an unknown individual or group using a sledgehammer. The destruction of the monument was widely reported in the media, with many expressing shock and disappointment at the loss of a unique and culturally significant structure. The motivations behind the destruction of the Guidestones remain unclear, although some have speculated that it may have been an act of vandalism or a deliberate attempt to erase a perceived symbol of the New World Order.\n\n### **Aftermath**\n\nThe destruction of the Georgia Guidestones has sparked a range of reactions from the public and the media. Many have expressed sadness and disappointment at the loss of a unique cultural landmark, while others have seen the destruction as a form of liberation from the perceived esoteric and occult connotations of the monument. The site of the Guidestones has been temporarily fenced off, and a local fundraising campaign has been launched to raise funds for a replacement monument or memorial.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are a 19th-century granite monument that stands over 21 feet tall, weighing over 119 tons. The monument is a series of six granite slabs, each weighing around 19 tons, which are arranged in a circular pattern. The slabs are inscribed with a series of cryptic messages and symbols, which have been interpreted in various ways over the years.\n\n#### **Inscriptions**\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are a series of cryptic messages that have sparked intense debate and speculation. The inscriptions are arranged in four separate tablets, which are inscribed on the north, south, east, and west sides of the monument. The inscriptions read as follows:\n\n* North tablet: \"Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\"\n* South tablet: \"Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.\"\n* East tablet: \"Unite humanity with a living new language.\"\n* West tablet: \"Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.\"\n\n#### **Explanatory tablet**\n\nThe explanatory tablet is a small inscription located on the south side of the monument, which provides a brief explanation of the purpose of the Guidestones. The inscription reads: \"Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason.\"\n\n#### **Physical data**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are a 19th-century granite monument that stands over 21 feet tall, weighing over 119 tons. The monument is a series of six granite slabs, each weighing around 19 tons, which are arranged in a circular pattern. The slabs are inscribed with a series of cryptic messages and symbols, which have been interpreted in various ways over the years.\n\n#### **Guidestone languages**\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in four separate languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, and Hindi. The languages were chosen for their global significance and were intended to promote unity and understanding among different cultures.\n\n#### **Astronomical features**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are aligned with several astronomical features, including the rising and setting of the sun and the stars. The monument is also aligned with the Earth's magnetic field, which has led some to speculate about its esoteric and occult significance.\n\n**Interpretations**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been interpreted in a range of ways over the years, with some seeing them as a symbol of a New World Order and others as a form of modern-day Stonehenge. Some have interpreted the inscriptions as a call to action, while others have seen them as a form of esoteric wisdom.\n\n#### **Conspiracy theories**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of several conspiracy theories over the years, including claims that they are a symbol of a New World Order or a form of mind control. Some have speculated that the monument was commissioned by a secret society or a group of elite individuals who sought to promote their own agenda.\n\n**See also**\n\n* New World Order\n* Stonehenge\n* Conspiracy theory\n* Esotericism\n* New Age movement\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Guide to an Age of Reason\" by Philip Coppens\n* \"The Secret of the Georgia Guidestones\" by Jay Weidner\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Symbol of the New World Order\" by David Icke\n\n**External links**\n\n* Georgia Guidestones official website\n* Georgia Guidestones Wikipedia page\n* Georgia Guidestones on Facebook\n* Georgia Guidestones on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Georgia_Guidestones\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Construction\n##Reaction\n##Destruction\n###Aftermath\n#Description\n##Inscriptions\n##Explanatory tablet\n##Physical data\n##Guidestone languages\n##Astronomical features\n#Interpretations\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the foundation upon which all life on Earth, and potentially other planets, is established. Land is a critical component of the Earth's ecosystem, providing habitats for diverse plant and animal species, regulating the climate, and supporting human civilization.\n\n## Definition\n\nLand is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses a wide range of physical and biological elements. It is often defined as the solid, non-living surface of the Earth, excluding water bodies such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. However, land also includes the underlying geology, soil, and other subsurface features that shape the planet's surface.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in Old English and Germanic languages, where it was used to describe the ground or earth. Over time, the term has evolved to encompass a broader range of meanings, including territory, country, and even land ownership.\n\n## Physical Science\n\n### Formation\n\nThe formation of land is a complex process that involves the interaction of geological, climatic, and biological factors. The Earth's surface is constantly changing through processes such as plate tectonics, weathering, and erosion, which shape the landscape and create new landforms. Volcanic activity, earthquakes, and other geological events also contribute to the creation and destruction of land.\n\n### Landmasses\n\nA landmass is a large area of land that is contiguous and separated from other land by water. The seven continents of the world – Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America – are the largest landmasses. These continents are further divided into smaller landmasses, such as islands, peninsulas, and mountain ranges.\n\n### Terrain\n\nTerrain refers to the physical features of a region, including its shape, elevation, and surface characteristics. Terrain can be divided into several categories, including mountains, plateaus, plains, and valleys. Mountains are elevated regions of land that are formed through volcanic or tectonic activity. Plateaus are flat or gently sloping areas of land that are elevated above the surrounding terrain. Plains are flat or gently sloping areas of land that are often formed through erosion or deposition. Valleys are low-lying areas of land that are often formed through erosion or tectonic activity.\n\n### Geomorphology\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the Earth's physical features and their evolution over time. Geomorphologists examine the shapes, sizes, and relationships between landforms to understand the processes that shape the Earth's surface. Geomorphology is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of geology, geography, and earth sciences.\n\n### Climate\n\nClimate refers to the long-term average weather patterns of a region. Climate is influenced by a range of factors, including latitude, altitude, ocean currents, and atmospheric circulation patterns. Climate varies significantly across different regions of the world, with some areas experiencing hot and dry conditions, while others are cold and wet.\n\n## Features\n\n### Coasts and Islands\n\nCoasts and islands are unique features of the Earth's surface that are shaped by the interaction of land and sea. Coasts are the boundaries between land and water, and they are formed through a range of geological and biological processes. Islands are landmasses that are surrounded by water on all sides, and they are often formed through volcanic or tectonic activity.\n\n### Mountains and Plateaus\n\nMountains and plateaus are elevated regions of land that are formed through volcanic or tectonic activity. Mountains are typically formed through the movement of the Earth's crust, which causes the rocks to buckle and fold. Plateaus are flat or gently sloping areas of land that are elevated above the surrounding terrain.\n\n### Plains and Valleys\n\nPlains and valleys are flat or gently sloping areas of land that are often formed through erosion or deposition. Plains are typically formed through the deposition of sediments, such as sand or silt, which are carried by water or wind. Valleys are low-lying areas of land that are often formed through erosion or tectonic activity.\n\n### Caves and Craters\n\nCaves and craters are unique features of the Earth's surface that are formed through geological processes. Caves are underground openings that are formed through the erosion of rock by water or other agents. Craters are depressions in the Earth's surface that are formed through volcanic or meteorite impacts.\n\n## Layers\n\n### Land Cover\n\nLand cover refers to the surface characteristics of the land, including the types of vegetation, soil, and other features that cover the surface. Land cover can be divided into several categories, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and urban areas.\n\n### Soil\n\nSoil is a critical component of the Earth's ecosystem, providing nutrients and habitat for plants and animals. Soil is formed through the breakdown of rocks and organic matter, and it is shaped by a range of factors, including climate, vegetation, and topography.\n\n### Continental Crust\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost solid layer of the Earth, extending from the surface to a depth of approximately 50 kilometers. The continental crust is composed of a range of rocks, including granite, basalt, and sandstone, which are formed through geological processes.\n\n## Life Science\n\n### Land Biomes\n\nLand biomes are large areas of land that are characterized by a specific type of vegetation and climate. There are several land biomes, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras. Each biome is adapted to its specific climate and soil conditions, and they provide habitat for a range of plant and animal species.\n\n### Fauna and Flora\n\nFauna and flora refer to the animal and plant species that inhabit a particular region. Fauna include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects, while flora include plants, algae, and fungi. Fauna and flora are adapted to their specific environment and play critical roles in the ecosystem.\n\n## Humans and Land\n\n### Culture\n\nCulture refers to the way of life of a particular group of people, including their customs, traditions, and values. Culture is shaped by the environment in which people live, and it influences the way people interact with the land. Cultural practices, such as agriculture and hunting, have a significant impact on the environment.\n\n### Travel\n\nTravel refers to the movement of people from one place to another, often for leisure or business purposes. Travel has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of transportation emissions and resource consumption.\n\n### Trade\n\nTrade refers to the exchange of goods and services between different regions or countries. Trade has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of transportation emissions and resource consumption.\n\n### Land Use\n\nLand use refers to the way in which people use the land, including agriculture, urbanization, and conservation. Land use has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of soil erosion, water pollution, and habitat destruction.\n\n### Law\n\nLaw refers to the rules and regulations that govern the use of land, including property rights, zoning laws, and environmental regulations. Law has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of land use and resource management.\n\n### Geopolitics\n\nGeopolitics refers to the study of the relationship between politics and geography, including the impact of geography on international relations and global governance. Geopolitics has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of resource extraction, territorial disputes, and climate change.\n\n## Environmental Issues\n\n### Soil Degradation\n\nSoil degradation refers to the decline in soil quality and fertility, which can be caused by a range of factors, including erosion, salinization, and nutrient depletion. Soil degradation has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of decreased crop yields and increased greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Pollution\n\nPollution refers to the introduction of contaminants into the environment, including air, water, and soil. Pollution has a significant impact on the environment, particularly in terms of human health and ecosystem degradation.\n\n### Biodiversity Loss\n\nBiodiversity loss refers to the decline in the variety of plant and animal species, which can be caused by a range of factors, including habitat destruction, overexploitation, and climate change.

From the early days of experimentation to the widespread use of cellphones and smartphones, the telephone has revolutionized the way people communicate.\n\n**#AT&T and the Bell System**\n\nThe telephone industry in the United States was dominated by AT&T and the Bell System for much of its history. The company's roots date back to the American Bell Telephone Company, which was founded in 1881.\n\n### **American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)**\n\nAlexander Graham Bell, a Scottish-born inventor, filed the first patent for a telephone on March 7, 1876. He founded the American Bell Telephone Company to manufacture and distribute his invention. The company's first telephone exchange was established in Boston in 1877. By the late 1880s, American Bell had expanded its operations to several cities, including New York and Chicago. In 1889, the company was renamed the Bell Telephone Company of New England.\n\n### **AT&T (1899–1982)**\n\nIn 1899, AT&T was formed through the merger of several regional telephone companies, including the Bell Telephone Company of New England. AT&T became the parent company of the Bell System, which consisted of 22 regional telephone companies. Under AT&T's leadership, the Bell System expanded rapidly across the United States, introducing new technologies and services, such as long-distance telephone service and operator-assisted calls. By the mid-20th century, the Bell System was the largest telephone network in the world.\n\n### **Research priority**\n\nAT&T invested heavily in research and development, with a focus on improving the technology and expanding the network. The company's researchers made significant contributions to the field of telecommunications, including the development of the first transatlantic telephone cable in 1956.\n\n### **Targeting an audience**\n\nThe Bell System targeted its services at different segments of the population, including urban public telephones and rural telephone service.\n\n#### **Urban public telephones**\n\nIn urban areas, the Bell System installed public telephones, which were coin-operated and provided access to long-distance calls. These phones became a convenient way for people to make calls from public places, such as streets, parks, and restaurants.\n\n#### **Rural telephone service**\n\nIn rural areas, the Bell System provided telephone service to individual farms and homes. This service was often more expensive than urban service, but it helped to connect rural communities to the rest of the country.\n\n### **Breakup of AT&T in 1982**\n\nIn 1982, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, alleging that the company had abused its monopoly power in the telephone market. The lawsuit led to the breakup of AT&T, with the company being split into seven regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs). The breakup marked a significant shift in the telephone industry, as it paved the way for competition and innovation.\n\n**#Cellphones and smartphones**\n\nThe introduction of cellphones and smartphones in the 1980s and 1990s revolutionized the way people communicate. Cellphones provided users with the ability to make and receive calls, send text messages, and access the internet from anywhere.\n\n### **Cellphones**\n\nThe first cellphone call was made in 1973 by Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola. The first commercial cellphone was released in 1983, and it quickly gained popularity among consumers. By the mid-1990s, cellphones had become a common sight on the streets of the United States.\n\n### **Smartphones**\n\nThe introduction of smartphones in the late 1990s and early 2000s marked a significant shift in the cellphone market. Smartphones provided users with the ability to access the internet, check email, and use apps, making them a powerful tool for communication and productivity.\n\n**#Personnel**\n\nThe telephone industry employed a significant number of people, including switchboard operators, laborers, and technicians.\n\n### **Switchboard and operators**\n\nSwitchboard operators were responsible for connecting calls and providing customer service. They worked in telephone exchanges, where they answered calls, connected them to the correct parties, and provided information to customers.\n\n### **Labor force: bias for and against women**\n\nThe telephone industry had a significant impact on women's employment in the early 20th century. Many women worked as switchboard operators, and the industry provided them with access to education and training. However, the industry also faced criticism for its discriminatory practices, including paying women lower wages and providing them with fewer benefits than men.\n\n### **Strikes**\n\nThe telephone industry faced several strikes in the early 20th century, including the 1919 switchboard operators' strike in New York City. The strike was led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and was sparked by demands for better wages and working conditions.\n\n### **Hawthorne studies**\n\nThe telephone industry was the subject of the Hawthorne studies, a series of experiments conducted by Elton Mayo in the 1920s and 1930s. The studies examined the impact of working conditions on employee productivity and found that social factors, such as communication and relationships with supervisors, played a significant role in determining productivity.\n\n### **Employee benefits**\n\nThe telephone industry provided its employees with a range of benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and paid vacation time. These benefits helped to attract and retain employees, particularly in a industry where wages were often lower than in other sectors.\n\n**#Users**\n\nThe telephone industry served a wide range of users, including businesses, housewives, and individuals.\n\n### **Business**\n\nBusinesses used the telephone to communicate with customers, suppliers, and other companies. They also used the telephone to access long-distance services, such as conference calls and messaging.\n\n### **Housewives**\n\nHousewives used the telephone to communicate with family members, friends, and neighbors. They also used the telephone to order groceries, schedule appointments, and access other services.\n\n### **Gender and culture roles**\n\nThe telephone industry reflected and reinforced traditional gender roles in the early 20th century. Men were often associated with business and technology, while women were associated with domestic and social activities.\n\n### **Telemarketing**\n\nTelemarketing became a significant aspect of the telephone industry in the mid-20th century. Telemarketers used the telephone to sell products and services to consumers, often using scripted pitches and sales techniques.\n\n### **9-1-1**\n\nThe introduction of 9-1-1 emergency services in the 1960s marked a significant shift in the telephone industry. 9-1-1 services provided users with a quick and easy way to access emergency services, such as police, fire, and ambulance.\n\n### **Harassing calls**\n\nHarassing calls, including prank calls and obscene calls, became a significant problem in the telephone industry in the late 20th century. Telephone companies and authorities took steps to address this issue, including enacting laws and regulations to prevent harassing calls.\n\n### **Literary fears**\n\nLiterary works, such as Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and George Orwell's \"1984\", explored the potential dangers of the telephone and its impact on society.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* History of telecommunications\n* History of the internet\n* History of computing\n* Telephone industry\n* AT&T\n* Bell System\n* Switchboard operators\n* Labor force: bias for and against women\n* Strikes\n* Hawthorne studies\n* Employee benefits\n* Business\n* Housewives\n* Gender and culture roles\n* Telemarketing\n* 9-1-1\n* Harassing calls\n* Literary fears\n\n**#References**\n\n* \"A Narrative History of the Telephone\" by Bell Labs\n* \"The Telephone in American Life\" by the Library of Congress\n* \"The History of the Telephone\" by the Smithsonian Institution\n* \"The Telephone Industry: A History\" by the Federal Communications Commission\n* \"The Bell System: A History\" by AT&T Archives\n\n**#Further reading**\n\n### **Social and cultural studies**\n\n* \"The Telephone and the City\" by David Sibley\n* \"The Sociology of the Telephone\" by Bryan S.

He was a key figure in the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis, which led to the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government. Shinde rose to prominence within the Shiv Sena party, becoming the leader of the party in 2022.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEknath Shinde was born on September 9, 1964, in Tembhurni, a small village in the Palghar district of Maharashtra. His family was poor, and Shinde's early life was marked by hardship. He studied up to the 12th standard and later worked as a fruit vendor in Mumbai. Shinde's entry into politics was facilitated by his association with the Shiv Sena party.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\n### Entry into Politics\n\nShinde's entry into politics was facilitated by his association with the Shiv Sena party, which was founded by Bal Thackeray in 1966. Shinde was drawn to the party's ideology of Hindutva and its focus on promoting the interests of Maharashtrians. He joined the Shiv Sena in the 1980s and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent leader in the party.\n\n### Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & Ministries\n\nShinde's entry into the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly was in 2004, when he won the assembly seat from Kalyan. He served as a member of the assembly for four consecutive terms, from 2004 to 2022. During this period, Shinde held various ministerial portfolios, including the portfolios of PWD, Urban Development, and Housing.\n\nShinde's tenure as a minister was marked by controversy, with allegations of corruption and mismanagement. However, he remained a popular leader within the Shiv Sena party, known for his ability to connect with the party's grassroots workers.\n\n**Role in 2022 Maharashtra Political Crisis**\n\nThe 2022 Maharashtra political crisis was triggered by a rebellion within the Shiv Sena party, led by Eknath Shinde. Shinde, who was then the Leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, had grown increasingly dissatisfied with the party's leadership, particularly with the role of Uddhav Thackeray. Shinde and his supporters accused Thackeray of being soft on the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which were part of the MVA coalition government.\n\nShinde's rebellion led to a major crisis within the Shiv Sena party, with many of its MLAs backing him. The crisis eventually led to the collapse of the MVA government, and Shinde was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on June 30, 2022.\n\n**Chief Minister**\n\n### Electoral Performance\n\nShinde's tenure as Chief Minister has been marked by controversy, with allegations of corruption and mismanagement.

Shinde's party, the Shiv Sena, won 55 seats, making him the leader of the largest party in the assembly.\n\n**Leader of Shiv Sena**\n\n### Shiv Sena Leadership Dispute\n\nShinde's rebellion within the Shiv Sena party led to a major crisis within the party, with many of its MLAs backing him. The crisis eventually led to the expulsion of Uddhav Thackeray and many of his supporters from the party.\n\nShinde's leadership of the Shiv Sena has been marked by controversy, with allegations of corruption and mismanagement. However, he remains a popular leader within the party, known for his ability to connect with the party's grassroots workers.\n\n### Political Legitimacy\n\nShinde's legitimacy as the leader of the Shiv Sena has been questioned by many, particularly by his opponents within the party. However, he remains a key figure in the party's leadership, and his popularity among the party's grassroots workers has been a major factor in his ability to maintain his position.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, and the couple has two children. He is known to be a devout Hindu and has been involved in various social and charitable activities throughout his career.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nShinde's rise to prominence within the Shiv Sena party has been the subject of much attention in the media, with many outlets highlighting his ability to connect with the party's grassroots workers.

He is best known for founding FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, and Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm. Bankman-Fried has been a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency and trading industries, known for his views on charity and market regulation.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford University. Bankman-Fried's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and a passion for science, mathematics, and philosophy. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics in 2014 and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Stanford Law School in 2014.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter completing his law degree, Bankman-Fried worked at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm, and later at a hedge fund. In 2017, he founded Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm, and in 2019, he launched FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. Under Bankman-Fried's leadership, FTX quickly grew to become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. He was known for his innovative approach to trading and his emphasis on risk management.\n\n**Views on charity and market regulation**\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate for effective altruism, a philosophy that aims to maximize the positive impact of charitable donations. He has donated millions of dollars to various charities, including the Schistosomiasis Elimination Project and the Against Malaria Foundation. In addition, he has been an outspoken advocate for stricter market regulation in the cryptocurrency industry, arguing that it is necessary to prevent market manipulation and protect investors.\n\n**Bankruptcy of FTX**\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, citing a liquidity crisis and a loss of investor trust. The bankruptcy filing was a result of a series of events, including a failed merger with a rival exchange and allegations of market manipulation. Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO of FTX and Alameda Research, and the company's assets were frozen.\n\n**Arrest and charges**\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with multiple counts of wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. The charges were related to his role in the collapse of FTX and the misuse of customer funds. He was extradited to the United States and made his initial appearance in a New York federal court.\n\n**United States v. Bankman-Fried**\n\n**Trial conclusion**\n\nThe trial of Sam Bankman-Fried began in October 2023 and lasted several months. The prosecution argued that Bankman-Fried had used FTX customer funds to cover losses at Alameda Research and to fund his personal lifestyle. The defense argued that Bankman-Fried had acted in good faith and that the collapse of FTX was a result of external factors. On January 15, 2024, the jury delivered a verdict, finding Bankman-Fried guilty on all counts.\n\n**Second trial dismissed**\n\nIn March 2024, Bankman-Fried's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that the prosecution had withheld evidence and that the trial had been unfair. The judge granted the motion, dismissing the charges and releasing Bankman-Fried from custody.\n\n**Appeal**\n\nThe prosecution appealed the dismissal of the charges, arguing that the judge had erred in granting the motion. The appeal is ongoing, and Bankman-Fried remains free on bail.\n\n**Incarceration history**\n\nPrior to his arrest, Bankman-Fried had been in pre-trial detention for several months. He was held in a federal detention center in New York and was allowed to make phone calls and receive visits from his lawyers and family.\n\n**Donations**\n\n**Politics**\n\n**2020 and earlier**\n\nBankman-Fried was a registered Democrat and had donated to various Democratic candidates, including Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. He had also donated to the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of California.\n\n**2021–2022**\n\nIn 2021, Bankman-Fried began to donate to Republican candidates, including Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley. He had also donated to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

The species was initially collected by botanists in the 1830s, but it wasn't until the 1860s that the species was formally described and named. At the time of its discovery, Torreya taxifolia was considered to be a unique and fascinating species, with its distinctive foliage and trunk shape setting it apart from other species of trees in the region.\n\n**Taxonomy and Naming**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a member of the family Taxaceae, which is a group of coniferous trees that are native to the southeastern United States and eastern Asia. The species was named by the American botanist, Asa Gray, who first described the species in 1857. The name \"Torreya\" is derived from the name of the Italian botanist, Torre, who was a prominent figure in the field of botany in the 19th century. The species name \"taxifolia\" refers to the fact that the leaves of the species are similar to those of the yew tree (Taxus baccata).\n\n**Type Species of Genus Torreya**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya, which is a group of coniferous trees that are native to the southeastern United States. The genus was first described by the American botanist, Asa Gray, in 1857, and it currently contains several species of trees that are found in the region. The genus is characterized by its distinctive foliage and trunk shape, as well as its ability to thrive in a variety of environments.\n\n**Common Names**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg tree, due to its distinctive nutmeg-like seeds and its ability to thrive in the warm, humid climate of Florida. The species is also known as the Florida torreya, due to its native range in the state. In addition, the species is sometimes referred to as the Gulf coast torreya, due to its range along the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Technical Description**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a coniferous tree that typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters (66-100 feet). The species has a conical shape, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The bark of the species is dark brown and scaly, with deep furrows that give the trunk a distinctive, rugged appearance. The leaves of the species are needle-like and dark green, with a distinctive notch at the tip. The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern on the branches, and they are 2-5 cm (0.8-2 inches) long.\n\n**Subcanopy Growth Adaptations**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has a unique growth adaptation that allows it to thrive in the subcanopy layer of forests. The species has a complex system of roots that allow it to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, even in areas where the soil is poor in nutrients. In addition, the species has a distinctive leaf shape that allows it to capture sunlight in the dappled light of the subcanopy layer.\n\n**Distribution**\n\n**Wild Population**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in the wild in the southeastern United States, where it is native to the states of Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. The species is typically found in the subcanopy layer of forests, where it grows in areas with rich soil and adequate moisture. The species is relatively rare in the wild, due to its limited range and the threats it faces from habitat destruction and disease.\n\n**Prehistoric Distribution**\n\nTorreya taxifolia was once found in a much wider range than it is today. Fossil evidence suggests that the species was once found in the southeastern United States, as well as in eastern Asia. The species is thought to have been more widespread in the prehistoric period, when the climate was warmer and more humid.\n\n**Ecology**\n\n**Habitat**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, swamps, and wetlands. The species prefers areas with rich soil and adequate moisture, and it is often found in association with other coniferous trees. In addition, the species is found in areas with a high level of humidity, such as along rivers and lakes.\n\n**Seed Dispersal**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has a unique method of seed dispersal, in which the seeds are dispersed by squirrels and other small mammals. The seeds are contained in a fruit that is similar to a nutmeg, and they are dispersed when the fruit is eaten by an animal. The seeds are then deposited in a new location, where they can germinate and grow into a new tree.\n\n**Extinction Threats**\n\n**Vulnerabilities of Restricted Range Size**\n\nTorreya taxifolia is vulnerable to extinction due to its limited range and the threats it faces from habitat destruction and disease. The species is found in a relatively small area, and it is estimated that there are fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild. In addition, the species is threatened by the loss of habitat due to the destruction of forests and the degradation of soil quality.\n\n**The Die-off Begins**\n\nThe die-off of Torreya taxifolia began in the 1990s, when a large number of trees in the wild began to die. The exact cause of the die-off is still unknown, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and climate change.\n\n**The Role of Pathogens in the Die-off**\n\nOne theory is that the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is related to a pathogen that is causing the trees to die. The pathogen is thought to be a fungus that is infecting the trees, causing them to become weak and vulnerable to disease. In addition, the fungus is thought to be spreading quickly, causing a large number of trees to die.\n\n**The Role of Habitat Deterioration in the Die-off**\n\nAnother theory is that the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is related to the deterioration of the species' habitat. The species is found in areas with rich soil and adequate moisture, but the quality of the soil is declining due to the degradation of the forest ecosystem. In addition, the species is being threatened by the loss of habitat due to the destruction of forests and the degradation of soil quality.\n\n**Focus on a Stem Canker Fungus**\n\nOne of the main hypotheses for the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is that it is caused by a stem canker fungus. The fungus is thought to be infecting the trees, causing them to become weak and vulnerable to disease. In addition, the fungus is thought to be spreading quickly, causing a large number of trees to die.\n\n**Ultimate Cause of Die-off Still Unsolved**\n\nDespite extensive research, the ultimate cause of the die-off of Torreya taxifolia is still unknown. The die-off is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and climate change. However, the exact cause of the die-off is still under investigation.\n\n**Conservation Actions**\n\n**Protect Areas in Species Range**\n\nOne of the main conservation actions being taken to protect Torreya taxifolia is the protection of areas in its species range. The species is found in a relatively small area, and it is essential to protect this area from habitat destruction and other threats. In addition, the species is being protected by laws and regulations that prohibit the destruction of its habitat.\n\n**List the Species as Endangered**\n\nTorreya taxifolia has been listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This listing recognizes the species' vulnerability to extinction and provides a framework for its conservation.\n\n**In Situ Habitat Improvement**\n\nAnother conservation action being taken to protect Torreya taxifolia is the improvement of its habitat in situ. The species is found in areas with rich soil and adequate moisture, but the quality of the soil is declining due to the degradation of the forest ecosystem. In addition, the species is being threatened by the loss of habitat due to the destruction of forests and the degradation of soil quality.\n\n**Ex Situ Genetic Safeguarding**\n\nIn addition to protecting the species in situ, ex situ genetic safeguarding is also being implemented to protect Torreya taxifolia. This involves the collection and conservation of the species' genetic material in controlled environments, such as seed banks and greenhouses.\n\n**Document Early Horticultural Plantings**\n\nFinally, the early horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia are being documented. This will help to provide a record of the species' history and its potential for conservation.\n\n**Conservation Controversies**\n\n**Assisted Migration (the Policy Debate)**\n\nOne of the main conservation controversies surrounding Torreya taxifolia is the debate over assisted migration. Assisted migration involves the relocation of the species to new areas, where it can potentially thrive. However, this practice is highly controversial, as it can potentially disrupt the ecosystem and lead to the loss of biodiversity.\n\n**Management of Seeds Produced Ex Situ**\n\nAnother conservation controversy surrounding Torreya taxifolia is the management of seeds produced ex situ. The species is being produced ex situ in controlled environments, such as seed banks and greenhouses. However, the management of these seeds is a complex issue, as it involves balancing the need to conserve the species with the need to prevent the spread of disease.\n\n**Seeds Produced from Official Plantings**\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings are subject to strict regulations and protocols. These seeds are typically produced in controlled environments, such as seed banks and greenhouses, and are subject to rigorous testing and quarantine procedures.\n\n**Seeds Accessed by Citizens**\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens, on the other hand, are subject to less stringent regulations and protocols. These seeds are typically produced in private gardens and greenhouses, and may be subject to less rigorous testing and quarantine procedures. However, the use of these seeds can potentially lead to the spread of disease and the loss of biodiversity.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Torreya_taxifolia\" following this outline:\n\n#Species discovery\n#Taxonomy and naming\n#Type species of genus Torreya\n#Common names\n#Description\n##Technical description\n##Subcanopy growth adaptations\n#Distribution\n##Wild population\n##Prehistoric distribution\n#Ecology\n##Habitat\n##Seed dispersal\n#Extinction threats\n##Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n##The die-off begins\n##The role of pathogens in the die-off\n##The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n##Focus on a stem canker fungus\n##Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n#Conservation actions\n##Protect areas in species range\n##List the species as endangered\n##In situ habitat improvement\n##Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n##Document early horticultural plantings\n#Conservation controversies\n##Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n##Management of seeds produced ex situ\n###Seeds produced from official plantings\n###Seeds accessed by citizens\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, and is also found in parts of North Africa and Western Asia.\n\n**Scientific Name**\n\nThe scientific name \"Anagyris foetida\" is derived from the Greek words \"anagyris,\" meaning \"bitter,\" and \"foetida,\" meaning \"stinking.\" This refers to the plant's unpleasant odor and taste.\n\n**Common names**\n\nAnagyris foetida is also known by several common names, including stinking galega, fetid anagyris, and bitter anagyris. It is sometimes referred to as a \"false galega\" due to its similarity in appearance to the species Galega officinalis.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, where it can be found growing wild in countries such as Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It has also been introduced to parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, and to Western Asia, including Israel and Palestine.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nAnagyris foetida grows in a variety of habitats, including rocky outcrops, dry hillsides, and woodland edges. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.\n\n**Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that enable it to survive the winter and early spring periods. These include:\n\n### Summer leaf-fall\n\nIn the late summer, Anagyris foetida sheds its leaves, a process known as deciduousness. This allows the plant to conserve water and nutrients during the dry winter months. The leaves fall to the ground, where they act as a mulch, retaining moisture and suppressing the growth of weeds.\n\n### Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to the plant's nectar-rich flowers. The flowers are also a source of food for birds, and provide a vital source of energy during the spring and summer months.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds are dispersed in several ways, including:\n\n### Soil seed banks\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida can remain viable in the soil for several years, a process known as seed banking. This allows the plant to maintain a reservoir of seeds, which can germinate in the following spring, allowing the plant to colonize new areas.\n\n### Olive mimicry\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida are similar in appearance to those of the olive tree (Olea europaea), and are often mistaken for them. This has led to the seeds being transported by humans and animals, often unintentionally, allowing the plant to spread to new areas.\n\n### Role of sheep\n\nSheep have been known to eat the seeds of Anagyris foetida and deposit them in new areas, often in their dung. This has led to the plant being able to colonize new areas, often in areas where it would not have been able to grow naturally.\n\n### Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nOther mammals and birds may also play a role in dispersing the seeds of Anagyris foetida, although this has not been extensively studied.\n\n### Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nThere may be other, as yet unknown, seed dispersal vectors that play a role in the dispersal of Anagyris foetida seeds.\n\n### Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have a tough, waterproof coat that allows them to survive the winter months and remain viable for several years.\n\n**Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant. Its roots fix nitrogen from the air, a process known as nitrogen fixation, which benefits other plants growing nearby. It also provides a source of food and shelter for beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies.\n\n**Medicinal use**\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for several purposes, including as a treatment for fever, rheumatism, and digestive problems. However, its use as a medicinal plant is not well documented, and its effectiveness and safety have not been extensively studied.\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nAnagyris foetida is toxic to humans and animals, and should be handled with care. The plant contains several toxic compounds, including anagyrine, which can cause birth defects and other health problems.\n\n### Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n\nThe alkaloid anagyrine, found in Anagyris foetida, has been shown to cause birth defects in laboratory animals. This has led to concerns about the plant's safety for use in traditional medicine.\n\n### Danger to children\n\nChildren should be kept away from Anagyris foetida, as they may be tempted to eat the plant's leaves or flowers, which can be toxic.\n\n### Hazardous tainting of milk products\n\nThe plant's toxic compounds can taint milk products, such as cheese and butter, if the plant is allowed to grow near dairy animals.\n\n### Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n\nThere have been reports of accidental poisoning in Algeria, where people have eaten Anagyris foetida leaves or flowers, leading to serious health problems.\n\n**Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous**\n\nAnagyris and Anagyrous are the names of two ancient Greek cities, which were said to have been founded by the hero Anagyros.\n\n### Lysistrata\n\nIn the ancient Greek play \"Lysistrata,\" written by Aristophanes, Anagyris is mentioned as a plant that is used for medicinal purposes.\n\n### Persistence of name\n\nThe name \"Anagyris\" has persisted in modern times, and is still used as a scientific name for the plant.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Anagyris foetida\n* Avian pollinators\n* Avian nectar thief\n* Insect pollinators\n\n**See also**\n\n* Legume family (Fabaceae)\n* Nitrogen fixation\n* Medicinal plants\n* Toxic plants\n* Seed banking\n* Olive tree (Olea europaea)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company has gained international recognition for its innovative submersible designs and its role in exploring some of the world's most iconic underwater sites.\n\n# Background\n\nOceanGate was founded with the goal of making deep-sea exploration accessible to a wider audience, while also advancing the field of underwater research and conservation. The company's founders drew inspiration from the early days of deep-sea exploration, when pioneers like Jacques Cousteau and Robert Ballard pushed the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding of the ocean.\n\nThe company's name, OceanGate, reflects its mission to create a gateway to the ocean, allowing people to explore and discover the wonders of the deep. OceanGate's submersibles are designed to be versatile and capable of operating in a variety of underwater environments, from shallow coastal waters to the deepest parts of the ocean.\n\n# History\n\n## 2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, a marine engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for deep-sea exploration. Rush's vision for the company was to create a private submersible operator that could provide safe and reliable access to the ocean for researchers, scientists, and explorers. In the early days, OceanGate focused on developing its first submersible, the Antipodes.\n\nThe Antipodes was a 3-person submersible designed for shallow-water operations. The vessel was constructed by a team of skilled engineers and technicians at OceanGate's facilities in the United States. The Antipodes was a significant achievement for OceanGate, as it marked the company's first successful foray into submersible design and construction.\n\n## 2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n\nIn 2013, OceanGate began constructing its second submersible, the Cyclops. The Cyclops was a larger and more advanced vessel than the Antipodes, designed for deeper-water operations. The submersible featured a robust design and a range of advanced sensors and communication systems.\n\nDuring this period, OceanGate also expanded its team, hiring experienced engineers and technicians to support the development of its submersibles. However, in 2016, the company's founder, Stockton Rush, announced that he would be leaving OceanGate to pursue other opportunities. The company's future direction and leadership were put in question, but OceanGate's management team remained committed to the company's mission and vision.\n\n## 2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nUnder the leadership of its new CEO, OceanGate continued to expand its fleet of submersibles and its operations in the ocean. In 2019, the company launched its latest submersible, the Titan, a 5-person vessel designed for deep-sea exploration and research. The Titan was built in partnership with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was designed to operate at depths of up to 6,000 meters.\n\nIn 2020, OceanGate became the first private company to successfully dive to the wreck of the Titanic, a historic underwater site located in the North Atlantic Ocean. The company's Titan submersible made the historic dive, marking a significant milestone in the company's history and a major achievement in deep-sea exploration.\n\n## 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Titan submersible imploded while on a dive to the Titanic wreck site, resulting in the loss of all lives on board. Stockton Rush, the founder and CEO of OceanGate, was among those who lost their lives in the incident. The incident sparked an international response, with investigators and experts working to determine the cause of the implosion.\n\nThe incident also raised questions about the safety and regulation of manned submersibles, highlighting the need for greater oversight and standards in the industry. OceanGate's management team has since announced that the company will be taking steps to address these concerns and ensure the safety of its operations and personnel.\n\n# Submersibles\n\n## Antipodes\n\nThe Antipodes was OceanGate's first submersible, designed for shallow-water operations. The vessel was a 3-person submersible with a diameter of approximately 2 meters and a length of 5 meters. The Antipodes was equipped with a range of advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing it to operate safely and effectively in shallow waters.\n\n## Cyclops 1\n\nThe Cyclops 1 was OceanGate's second submersible, designed for deeper-water operations. The vessel was a larger and more advanced submersible than the Antipodes, with a diameter of approximately 3 meters and a length of 6 meters. The Cyclops 1 was equipped with a range of advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing it to operate safely and effectively in deeper waters.\n\n## Titan\n\nThe Titan was OceanGate's latest submersible, designed for deep-sea exploration and research. The vessel was a 5-person submersible with a diameter of approximately 4 meters and a length of 8 meters. The Titan was equipped with a range of advanced sensors and communication systems, allowing it to operate safely and effectively in deep waters.\n\n# Associated entities\n\nOceanGate has partnered with a number of organizations and institutions in support of its mission and operations.
