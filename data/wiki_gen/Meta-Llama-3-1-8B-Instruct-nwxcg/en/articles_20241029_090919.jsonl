United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 27 members of the House of Representatives from the state of New York.\n\n2020-22 redistricting controversy\n\nThe 2020 United States census led to a significant shift in the state's population, which resulted in a reapportionment of congressional seats. The New York State Legislature was responsible for redrawing the state's congressional districts, but the process was contentious. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate were unable to agree on a plan, leading to a bipartisan commission being established to draw the new districts. The commission's plan was later passed by both houses of the legislature, but it was challenged in court by the New York Republican Party and several individual plaintiffs. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, and the new districts were used for the 2022 elections.\n\nOverview\n\nIn the 2022 elections, 27 seats in the House of Representatives were up for election. The Democratic Party held 19 seats, and the Republican Party held 8 seats. The Working Families Party and the Conservative Party also had candidates running in several districts.\n\nVotes by ballot line\n\nIn the 2022 elections, voters in New York could vote for candidates on several different ballot lines, including the Democratic, Republican, Conservative, Working Families, and Libertarian parties. The number of votes each candidate received on each ballot line was as follows:\n\n* Democratic: 4,121,444 (44.1%)\n* Republican: 3,433,919 (36.6%)\n* Conservative: 343,919 (3.7%)\n* Working Families: 243,919 (2.6%)\n* Libertarian: 43,919 (0.5%)\n\nVotes by district\n\nThe number of votes each candidate received in each district was as follows:\n\nDistrict 1\n\nRepublican/Conservative nominee\n\n*

She was the wife of Anthony Eden, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1955 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1963.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n\nClarissa Spencer was born on July 24, 1937, in London, England. Her father, Henry Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, was a member of the British aristocracy, and her mother, Cynthia Hamilton, was a socialite. Clarissa spent her early years traveling with her family between Paris, Tuscany, and London, where she was exposed to the finer things in life and developed a love for art, music, and literature.\n\n### Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nDuring World War II, Clarissa's family moved to Oxford, where they lived in a country house. She spent her teenage years studying at a boarding school, but her education was interrupted when she began working at the Foreign Office in London. Her role involved translating documents and performing other administrative tasks.\n\n### Post-war\n\nAfter the war, Clarissa continued to work at the Foreign Office, where she met her future husband, Anthony Eden. She was attracted to his charming and charismatic personality, and the two began a romantic relationship.\n\n**2007 memoir**\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa published her memoir, _Up Hill All the Way_, which offered a candid account of her life with Anthony Eden. The book provided a unique insight into the private life of a British prime minister and his wife, highlighting the challenges and triumphs they faced during their time in office.\n\n**Friends and acquaintances**\n\n### Early admirers\n\nClarissa was known for her beauty and charm, which earned her many admirers. She was particularly close to a group of young men who were part of the aristocracy, including Prince Charles, the future King of the United Kingdom.\n\n### Other friends\n\nClarissa's social circle included many notable figures, including politicians, artists, and writers. She was particularly close to Barbara Cartland, the famous romance novelist, and the two women often spent weekends together at their respective country estates.\n\n**Relationship with Anthony Eden**\n\n### Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa met Anthony Eden in 1942, when they were both working at the Foreign Office. Eden was a close friend of Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Clarissa was drawn to his charismatic personality. The two began a romantic relationship, which was initially kept secret due to Eden's position in the government.\n\n### Marriage to Eden\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden married in 1952, at the age of 15. The marriage was a love match, and the two were deeply in love. However, their relationship was not without its challenges, as Eden's position in the government often put him at odds with his wife.\n\n#### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nClarissa was aware of the risks involved in marrying a politician, but she was determined to support her husband in his career. She was fiercely loyal to Eden and worked tirelessly to help him navigate the complexities of politics.\n\n#### Married life\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden had a happy marriage, despite the challenges they faced. They were known for their love of fine art, music, and literature, and they spent their leisure time traveling and entertaining guests at their country estate.\n\n**Eden's premiership**\n\n### Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n\nAs the wife of the Prime Minister, Clarissa was the chatelaine of Downing Street and Chequers, the official country residence of the Prime Minister. She was responsible for organizing events and managing the household staff, which was a challenging task given the scale and complexity of the operations.\n\n### Suez Crisis\n\nThe Suez Crisis was a major turning point in Clarissa's life with Anthony Eden. In 1956, Eden's government launched a military operation to regain control of the Suez Canal, which had been nationalized by Egypt. The crisis led to a major international backlash, and Eden's government was forced to resign.\n\n#### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nClarissa was deeply affected by the Suez Crisis, which had a profound impact on her husband's reputation and their personal lives. In her memoir, she recalled the traumatic events of that period, including the night when Eden's government resigned and the couple returned to their country estate, feeling defeated and demoralized.\n\n**Political influence**\n\nClarissa's influence on her husband's career was significant, and she played a key role in advising him on matters of state. She was known for her sharp intellect and her ability to analyze complex issues, which made her a valuable asset to the government.\n\n**Protective influence**\n\nClarissa was also a protective influence on her husband, who was often under intense pressure from his colleagues and the media. She worked tirelessly to shield him from the stresses of politics and to maintain a sense of normalcy in their personal lives.\n\n**Aftermath of Suez**\n\n### Goldeneye\n\nThe aftermath of the Suez Crisis was marked by a period of introspection and self-doubt for Anthony Eden and his wife. They retreated to their country estate, Goldeneye, where they spent several weeks in seclusion, trying to come to terms with the consequences of their actions.\n\n### Eden's resignation\n\nIn January 1957, Anthony Eden resigned as Prime Minister, citing ill health and a desire to retire from politics. The move was seen as a major blow to his reputation, and it marked the end of an era in British politics.\n\n**Eden's retirement and death**\n\nAfter his resignation, Anthony Eden retired from politics and spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity. He died in 1977, at the age of 79, leaving behind a legacy of controversy and tragedy.\n\n**Widowhood**\n\nClarissa was deeply affected by her husband's death, which marked the end of an era in her life. She spent the rest of her life in retirement, surrounded by her friends and family, and she continued to support causes close to her heart.\n\n### Longevity\n\nClarissa lived a long and fulfilling life, passing away in 2021 at the age of 83. Her legacy as the wife of a British Prime Minister and her own contributions to politics and society were widely recognized and celebrated.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nClarissa's life and experiences have been the subject of several books, films, and television dramas. Her memoir, _Up Hill All the Way_, was adapted into a TV series, which offered a candid account of her life with Anthony Eden.\n\n**References**\n\n* _Up Hill All the Way_ (memoir, 2007)\n* _Clarissa Eden: A Life_ (biography, 2010)\n* _The Eden Legacy_ (documentary, 2012)\n* _Goldeneye_ (TV series, 2014)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Clarissa Eden's official website\n* The Eden Archive (online archive of the Eden family papers)\n* The Churchill Centre (online archive of Winston Churchill's papers)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Clarissa_Eden\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n##Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n##Post-war\n#2007 memoir\n#Friends and acquaintances\n##Early admirers\n##Other friends\n#Relationship with Anthony Eden\n##Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n##Marriage to Eden\n###Attitudes to the marriage\n###Married life\n#Eden's premiership\n##Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n##Suez Crisis\n###\"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n##Political influence\n##Protective influence\n##Aftermath of Suez\n###Goldeneye\n###Eden's resignation\n#Eden's retirement and death\n#Widowhood\n##Longevity\n#In popular culture\n#Arms\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The suspensions drew widespread attention and criticism from users, journalists, and experts, who accused Twitter of censorship and politicization.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nTwitter's policies and moderation practices have been a subject of controversy for several years. The company has faced criticism for its handling of hate speech, harassment, and misinformation on the platform. In 2022, Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk, who has been a vocal critic of the platform's moderation policies and has promised to make changes to improve free speech on the platform.\n\nAccount suspensions\n-------------------\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions began on December 1, 2022, when several high-profile accounts were suspended. The accounts suspended included:\n\n### Twitter policy changes\n\nTwitter introduced a new policy in December 2022 that prohibited users from sharing links to other social media platforms. The policy was intended to reduce the spread of misinformation, but critics argued that it was a form of censorship. The policy change was seen as a move to consolidate Twitter's dominance as a social media platform.\n\n### Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nSeveral flight-tracking accounts were suspended on December 1, 2022, sparking widespread criticism. The accounts provided real-time information on flight schedules, delays, and cancellations, and were seen as a valuable resource for travelers. Twitter claimed that the accounts were suspended due to a \"misunderstanding\" about the platform's rules.\n\n### Suspension of journalist accounts\n\nSeveral journalist accounts were suspended on December 2, 2022, sparking criticism from the media and journalism organizations. The accounts suspended included those of prominent journalists and news outlets, including The New York Times and CNN. Twitter claimed that the accounts were suspended due to a \"technical glitch.\"\n\n### Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nTwitter's CEO, Elon Musk, took to Twitter to explain the suspensions, claiming that they were part of an effort to \"clean up\" the platform. Musk stated that the suspensions were necessary to prevent \"bots\" and \"spammers\" from taking over the platform. Musk also claimed that the suspensions were intended to improve the health and safety of Twitter users.\n\nReinstatement of some accounts\n-----------------------------\n\nOn December 3, 2022, Twitter reinstated some of the suspended accounts. The accounts reinstated included those of prominent journalists and news outlets. Twitter claimed that the reinstatements were part of an effort to \"clarify\" the platform's rules and policies.\n\nResponses\n----------\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions drew widespread criticism and attention from users, journalists, and experts. The suspensions were seen as a form of censorship and politicization, and raised concerns about the impact on free speech and the media.\n\n### Suspended journalists\n\nSeveral suspended journalists spoke out about their experiences, including CNN's Don Lemon, who stated that his account was suspended due to a \"technical glitch.\" The New York Times' Maggie Haberman also spoke out about her suspension, stating that it was a form of \"censorship.\"\n\n### Other commentators\n\nOther commentators and experts also weighed in on the suspensions, including experts on social media and free speech. The suspensions were seen as a threat to the health and safety of Twitter users, and raised concerns about the impact on democracy and the media.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Twitter's moderation policies\n* Social media regulation\n* Free speech on social media", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This process has been ongoing since the end of World War II, with the aim of promoting peace, stability, and economic growth throughout the region.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of European integration can be divided into several distinct phases, each marked by significant developments and milestones.\n\n## Proto-integration period\n\nThe proto-integration period saw the emergence of various regional economic agreements and organizations, such as the Benelux Economic Union (1958) and the Scandinavian Common Market (1954). These early attempts at integration laid the groundwork for the more comprehensive European integration efforts that followed.\n\n## First phase: explaining integration, 1960s onwards\n\nThe first phase of European integration saw the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC), which was created in 1958 with the signing of the Treaty of Rome. The EEC aimed to create a common market among its member states, with the goal of promoting economic growth and stability. This phase also saw the development of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was established in 1951 and played a key role in promoting economic integration among member states.\n\n## Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of European integration saw a shift in focus from economic integration to governance and policy-making. The Single European Act (1986) established the principle of subsidiarity, which holds that decisions should be taken at the level closest to the citizen. This phase also saw the establishment of the European Monetary System (EMS), which aimed to promote monetary stability among member states.\n\n## Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe third phase of European integration saw the creation of the European Union (EU) through the Maastricht Treaty (1992). The EU established a single currency, the euro, and created a common foreign and security policy. This phase also saw the development of the Schengen Area, which allows for passport-free travel between member states.\n\n# Citizens' organisations calling for further integration\n\nSeveral citizens' organizations have called for further integration in Europe, including the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) and the European Movement (EM). These organizations aim to promote greater transparency and accountability in European decision-making, as well as to promote the interests of European citizens.\n\n# Overlap of membership in various agreements\n\nSeveral European countries are members of multiple regional agreements, including the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\n\n## Common membership of member states of the European Union\n\nThe European Union has 27 member states, which are also members of the Council of Europe and the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\n## Most integrated countries\n\nThe most integrated countries in Europe are the members of the Eurozone, which has 19 member states. These countries have adopted the euro as their official currency and have a high degree of economic integration.\n\n# Geographic scope\n\nEuropean integration is not limited to the geographic region of Europe, but can also extend to other regions and countries around the world.\n\n## Beyond geographic Europe\n\nEuropean integration has also been extended to other regions and countries, including the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, which aims to promote economic and political cooperation between the EU and its Mediterranean partners.\n\n## Limited to regions within geographic Europe\n\nEuropean integration is also limited to regions within geographic Europe, including the Nordic countries, the Baltic Sea region, and the Danube region.\n\n### Nordic countries\n\nThe Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, have a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Baltic Sea region\n\nThe Baltic Sea region, including the countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Nordic-Baltic Eight\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Eight, including the countries of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland, have a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Low Countries region (Benelux)\n\nThe Low Countries region, including the countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Black Sea region\n\nThe Black Sea region, including the countries of Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Central Europe\n\nCentral Europe, including the countries of Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Eastern Europe\n\nEastern Europe, including the countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Danube region\n\nThe Danube region, including the countries of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n### Balkans\n\nThe Balkans, including the countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, has a high degree of economic integration and cooperation, including a common market and a common monetary policy.\n\n# Council of Europe\n\nThe Council of Europe is a regional organization that aims to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Europe.

The ship was originally built as the Slava and underwent significant modernization and upgrades throughout its service life.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Slava-class cruisers were a class of guided missile cruisers built by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The class included four ships: Slava, Moscow, Varyag, and Admiral Lazarev. The cruisers were designed to serve as the flagship of the Soviet Navy's fleet, carrying a combination of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as artillery and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.\n\n**As Slava**\n\nThe Moskva was originally built as the Slava, and it was launched on May 29, 1982, at the Nikolayev South Shipyard in Ukraine. The ship was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on January 30, 1983. The Slava was one of the most advanced warships in the world at the time of its commissioning, featuring a unique bow-mounted P-1000 Vulkan anti-submarine rocket launcher and a combination of P-500 Bazalt anti-ship missiles and P-35 anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nThe Slava saw service in the Soviet Navy's Black Sea Fleet, where it played a key role in several international naval exercises and operations. In 1989, the ship was part of a Soviet naval task force that participated in a joint exercise with the Polish Navy in the Baltic Sea.\n\n**As Moskva**\n\nIn 1995, the Slava was renamed the Moskva, and it underwent a significant modernization program. The ship was equipped with new command and control systems, as well as upgraded radar and communication systems. The Moskva also received new anti-aircraft missile systems, including the SA-N-9 Gauntlet system.\n\nFollowing the modernization, the Moskva was re-commissioned into the Russian Navy in 1997. The ship served as the flagship of the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet, participating in several international naval exercises and operations. In 2001, the Moskva was part of a Russian naval task force that participated in a joint exercise with the Turkish Navy in the Black Sea.\n\n**Russian invasion of Ukraine**\n\nIn February 2022, the Russian Navy launched a series of naval operations in support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Moskva was part of a Russian naval task force that sailed from the port of Sevastopol in Crimea to the shores of Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, the Moskva was involved in the Snake Island campaign, a series of naval and airborne operations aimed at capturing the strategic Snake Island from Ukrainian forces.\n\n**Snake Island campaign**\n\nThe Moskva played a key role in the Snake Island campaign, providing artillery support and shore-based missile strikes against Ukrainian positions on the island. The ship was also involved in a series of naval engagements with Ukrainian patrol boats and coastal defense systems. On March 1, 2022, the Moskva was hit by a Ukrainian anti-ship missile, which caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and bridge.\n\n**Sinking**\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the Moskva was involved in a series of explosions on board the ship, which caused significant damage to the ship's propulsion systems and superstructure. The ship was towed back to the port of Sevastopol, where it sank on April 14, 2022, due to extensive damage and flooding. The sinking of the Moskva marked a significant defeat for the Russian Navy and a significant blow to the Russian military's efforts in Ukraine.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Moskva was the first major warship to be sunk in combat since the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.\n* The sinking of the Moskva marked a significant shift in the balance of power in the Black Sea, with the Ukrainian Navy gaining a strategic advantage over the Russian Navy.\n* The sinking of the Moskva also marked a significant blow to the Russian military's efforts in Ukraine, with the ship being one of the largest and most advanced warships in the Russian Navy.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations, as the information is based on publicly available sources and news reports.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Russian Defense Ministry: Russian Navy's Moskva Sinks After Ukrainian Missile Strike\n* BBC News: Ukraine war: Russia's Moskva warship sinks in Black Sea\n* The Guardian: Russia's Moskva warship sinks after missile strike, Ukraine claims\n* Al Jazeera: Ukraine says Russia's warship Moskva sinks in Black Sea", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict has resulted in significant humanitarian and economic impacts, and has drawn in foreign powers.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe war in Darfur began in 2003, when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebelled against the Sudanese government. The war led to the formation of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that was initially composed of militia fighters from Darfur. The RSF was led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who would later become a key figure in the 2023 conflict.\n\n## Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising led to the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir, who had been in power since 1989. A transitional government was established, led by Abdalla Hamdok, a civilian prime minister. However, the transition was marked by power struggles between different factions, including the military and the RSF.\n\n## Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) was formed in 2011 by Malik Agar, a former SPLM member who was opposed to the secession of South Sudan. The SPLM-N was based in the Nuba Mountains and sought to protect the rights of the local population. The SLM, on the other hand, was formed in 2002 by Minni Minnawi, a Darfurian rebel leader.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn 2023, tensions between the SAF and the RSF began to escalate, with the RSF accusing the SAF of attempting to disarm them. The RSF, led by Hemedti, began to mobilize its forces, while the SAF, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, attempted to maintain control over the country.\n\n# Course of the war\n\n## April–May 2023\n\n### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe conflict began on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. The RSF quickly gained control of the city, and the SAF was forced to retreat. The battle was marked by heavy fighting and significant losses on both sides.\n\n### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn May 5, 2023, the RSF and the SAF signed a ceasefire agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The agreement was brokered by the Saudi government and sought to establish a framework for peace talks between the two parties.\n\n## June–September 2023\n\n### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, fighting continued in Khartoum, with both sides accusing each other of violating the agreement. The RSF claimed that the SAF was attempting to reassert its control over the city, while the SAF accused the RSF of attempting to expand its territory.\n\n### Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn June 2023, the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) announced a joint initiative to broker peace talks between the RSF and the SAF. The initiative was led by African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.\n\n### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced that it would not participate in the peace talks unless the SAF agreed to withdraw its forces from the Nuba Mountains. The SPLM-N claimed that the SAF was attempting to control the region and suppress the local population.\n\n### Darfur front\n\nIn August 2023, fighting broke out in Darfur between the SLM and the SAF. The SLM claimed that the SAF was attempting to control the region and suppress the local population.\n\n## October–December 2023\n\n### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SAF suffered a significant defeat in Darfur, with the SLM launching a surprise attack on SAF positions in the region. The SAF was forced to retreat, and the SLM gained control of several key towns in the region.\n\n### Peace negotiations stall\n\nIn November 2023, the peace talks between the RSF and the SAF stalled, with both sides accusing each other of not negotiating in good faith. The talks were suspended, and fighting continued in Khartoum and Darfur.\n\n### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF launched a surprise attack on SAF positions in the Nile River Valley, crossing the river and gaining control of several key towns in the region.\n\n# January–April 2024\n\n### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, Hemedti traveled to several countries, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, in an effort to secure support for the RSF. Hemedti met with various leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nIn February 2024, fighting broke out in Kordofan and Gezira between the SAF and the RSF. The RSF claimed that the SAF was attempting to control the region and suppress the local population.\n\n### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn March 2024, the SAF gained control of several key towns in Omdurman, a suburb of Khartoum. The RSF was forced to retreat, and the SAF gained a significant advantage in the conflict.\n\n## April 2024–present\n\n### Fighting in Darfur\n\nIn April 2024, fighting broke out in Darfur between the SLM and the SAF. The SLM claimed that the SAF was attempting to control the region and suppress the local population.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nIn April 2024, fighting broke out in Kordofan between the SAF and the RSF. The RSF claimed that the SAF was attempting to control the region and suppress the local population.\n\n### Fighting along the Nile\n\nIn April 2024, fighting broke out along the Nile River Valley between the SAF and the RSF.

Chase, a federal judge and a prominent figure in the Federalist Party, was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" This article provides a comprehensive overview of the impeachment process, from the initial investigation to the trial in the Senate.\n\n# Background\n\nSamuel Chase was a well-known figure in American politics, having served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and as a senator from Maryland. He was a strong advocate for the Federalist Party and its policies, which often put him at odds with the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson. Chase's strong personality and outspoken views on the role of the judiciary in American society made him a target for impeachment.\n\n# Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n## Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nThe impeachment inquiry against Chase began on February 12, 1804, when the House of Representatives voted to launch an investigation into his conduct. The vote was largely along party lines, with 73 Republicans voting in favor and 32 Federalists opposing. This marked the beginning of a long and contentious process that would ultimately lead to Chase's trial in the Senate.\n\n## Early inquiry developments\n\nThe House committee tasked with investigating Chase's conduct held numerous hearings, during which several witnesses testified against him. The committee's report, which was published in July 1804, detailed several instances of alleged misconduct by Chase, including his role in the trial of Matthew Lyon, a Democratic-Republican congressman who had been convicted of defaming the president. Chase's defense team argued that he had acted impartially in the trial and that the accusations against him were baseless.\n\n## Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House committee presented its report to the full House, recommending that Chase be impeached on eight counts. The House debated the resolution at length, with many members expressing their concerns about Chase's conduct. After several days of debate, the House voted to adopt the impeachment resolution by a margin of 73-32.\n\n## Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the House committee continued to investigate Chase's conduct, gathering additional evidence and testimony. The committee's report, which was published in December 1804, detailed several instances of alleged misconduct by Chase, including his role in the trial of James Callender, a Democratic-Republican editor who had been convicted of libeling the president.\n\n## Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nThe House committee presented its final report to the full House on December 18, 1804, recommending that Chase be impeached on seven additional counts. The House debated the resolution at length, with many members expressing their concerns about Chase's conduct. After several days of debate, the House voted to adopt the articles of impeachment by a margin of 73-32.\n\n### Article I\n\nThe first article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of Matthew Lyon. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Lyon with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article II\n\nThe second article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of James Callender. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Callender with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article III\n\nThe third article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of James Callender. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Callender with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article IV\n\nThe fourth article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of John Thomas, a Democratic-Republican congressman who had been convicted of defaming the president. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Thomas with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article V\n\nThe fifth article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of Matthew Lyon. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Lyon with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article VI\n\nThe sixth article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of James Callender. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Callender with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article VII\n\nThe seventh article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of John Thomas. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Thomas with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Article VIII\n\nThe eighth article of impeachment charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his role as a judge in the trial of Matthew Lyon. The article alleged that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in the trial, and that he had failed to provide Lyon with a fair and impartial hearing.\n\n### Vote overview\n\nThe House of Representatives voted on the eight articles of impeachment on December 19, 1804. The articles were voted on separately, with the majority of members voting in favor of each article. The final vote on the eight articles was as follows:\n\n* Article I: 73-32\n* Article II: 73-32\n* Article III: 74-31\n* Article IV: 73-32\n* Article V: 73-32\n* Article VI: 74-31\n* Article VII: 73-32\n* Article VIII: 73-32\n\n# Appointment of House managers\n\nAfter the House of Representatives voted to adopt the articles of impeachment, the House appointed nine managers to conduct the trial in the Senate. The managers were as follows:\n\n* John Randolph of Virginia\n* William Branch Giles of Virginia\n* John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts\n* William Wirt of Virginia\n* Matthew Lyon of Vermont\n* John Taylor of Virginia\n* John Armstrong of Pennsylvania\n* Joseph Bradley Varnum of Massachusetts\n* Henry Lee of Virginia\n\n# Senate trial\n\n## Officers of the trial\n\nThe trial was presided over by William Howard, the president of the Senate. The Senate's chief justice, John Marshall, was also involved in the trial, serving as an advisor to the Senate on matters of law and procedure.\n\n## Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted rules for the trial, which included the following:\n\n* The trial would be conducted in open session, with the public and the press allowed to attend.\n* The prosecution would be led by the House managers, with the defense team consisting of the accused and his counsel.\n* The trial would be conducted according to the principles of common law, with the Senate acting as a jury.\n\n## Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1805, with the president of the Senate, William Howard, swearing in the members of the Senate and the House managers. The defense team, led by Luther Martin, presented its opening statements, arguing that the charges against Chase were baseless and that the trial was motivated by political considerations.\n\n## Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was decorated with flags and other symbols of patriotism, with the public and the press attending the trial in large numbers. The Chamber was also arranged to accommodate the large number of spectators, with galleries and seats provided for the public and the press.\n\n## Pleading phase\n\nThe pleading phase of the trial began on February 5, 1805, with the House managers presenting their case against Chase. The managers argued that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in several trials, including the trials of Matthew Lyon and James Callender. The defense team, led by Luther Martin, argued that the charges against Chase were baseless and that the trial was motivated by political considerations.\n\n## Argument phase\n\n### Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution's presentation began on February 6, 1805, with the House managers presenting their case against Chase. The managers argued that Chase had acted with bias and partiality in several trials, including the trials of Matthew Lyon and James Callender. The prosecution presented evidence from several witnesses, including Matthew Lyon and James Callender, who testified against Chase.\n\n### Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense team, led by Luther Martin, presented its case against the impeachment charges on February 9, 1805. The defense argued that the charges against Chase were baseless and that the trial was motivated by political considerations. The defense presented evidence from several witnesses, including Samuel Chase's colleagues and friends, who testified in his favor.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThe closing remarks of the trial were presented on February 12, 1805, with the House managers and the defense team presenting their final arguments. The House managers argued that the evidence presented during the trial was sufficient to prove Chase's guilt, while the defense team argued that the charges against Chase were baseless and that the trial was motivated by political considerations.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe Senate delivered its verdict on March 1, 1805, acquitting Samuel Chase on all eight articles of impeachment. The vote was as follows:\n\n* Article I: 19-20\n* Article II: 19-20\n* Article III: 20-19\n* Article IV: 19-20\n* Article V: 20-19\n* Article VI: 20-19\n* Article VII: 20-19\n* Article VIII: 20-19\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Immediate aftermath\n\nThe acquittal of Samuel Chase was met with mixed reactions. The Federalist Party, which had supported Chase throughout the trial, celebrated his acquittal as a victory for the party and for the principle of judicial independence. The Democratic-Republican Party, which had opposed Chase throughout the trial, saw the acquittal as a disappointment and a setback for their party's efforts to limit the power of the judiciary.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe impeachment trial of Samuel Chase had significant consequences for American politics and the judiciary. The trial established the principle that a president could be impeached by the House of Representatives and tried in the Senate, and it set a precedent for future impeachment trials. The trial also highlighted the importance of judicial independence and the need for the judiciary to remain impartial in the face of political pressure.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Additionally, the monument's location in the Black Hills, a region steeped in Native American history and significance, adds to its cultural importance.\n\nThe monument's popularity has also been fueled by its association with the American ideals of freedom, democracy, and patriotism. The four presidents featured on Mount Rushmore – George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln – represent key periods in American history, from the nation's founding to its growth and development. This has led to the monument being seen as a symbol of American identity and a representation of the country's values.\n\n**Common Themes**\n\nMount Rushmore has appeared in popular culture in various contexts, often exploring common themes associated with the monument. Two of these themes are particularly notable: destruction and alterations to the faces.\n\n### **Destruction**\n\nThe theme of destruction has been used to explore the monument's fragility and the consequences of human actions. In some depictions, Mount Rushmore is shown being destroyed or altered in some way, often as a result of a catastrophic event or a deliberate act. This theme can be seen as a commentary on the impermanence of human creations and the potential consequences of human actions.\n\nOne example of this theme can be seen in a 1963 episode of the TV show \"The Twilight Zone,\" titled \"The Shelter.\" In the episode, a family's fear of nuclear war is explored through their actions, which ultimately lead to the destruction of their community. The episode features a scene where Mount Rushmore is shown being destroyed, symbolizing the fragility of human creations in the face of catastrophic events.\n\n### **Alterations and Additions to the Faces**\n\nThe theme of alterations and additions to the faces has been used to explore the idea of changing historical narratives and the consequences of human actions. In some depictions, the faces on Mount Rushmore are shown being altered or added to, often as a result of a new discovery or a changing historical context.\n\nOne example of this theme can be seen in a 1994 episode of the TV show \"The X-Files,\" titled \"Dreamland II.\" In the episode, a group of aliens is shown altering the faces on Mount Rushmore, adding their own leader to the monument. This theme can be seen as a commentary on the changing nature of historical narratives and the potential consequences of altering the past.\n\n**Imitations of the Style**\n\nMount Rushmore's design has inspired many imitations in different media, reflecting its influence on popular culture. From sculptures to paintings, the monument's style has been emulated and adapted in various contexts.\n\nOne notable example of an imitation of the style can be seen in the 1986 film \"National Treasure,\" directed by Jon Turteltaub. In the film, a treasure hunter is shown creating a series of sculptures, including a miniature version of Mount Rushmore, using a combination of artistry and engineering. This scene showcases the monument's influence on popular culture and its enduring appeal.\n\n**Major Portrayals**\n\nMount Rushmore has appeared in various forms of popular culture, often in iconic and memorable portrayals. Two notable examples are:\n\n### **In North by Northwest**\n\nIn the 1959 film \"North by Northwest,\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Mount Rushmore is featured as a key plot point. The film follows a man who is mistaken for a spy and embarks on a cross-country journey to clear his name. In one of the film's most iconic scenes, the protagonist, Roger Thornhill, is chased by agents while standing in front of Mount Rushmore, symbolizing his struggle to clear his name.\n\n### **In Music**\n\nMount Rushmore has been referenced in various songs, often as a symbol of American identity and culture. One notable example is the 1985 song \"Mount Rushmore\" by the band The Smiths, which features lyrics that reference the monument's grandeur and the passing of time.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mount Rushmore\n* American culture\n* Popular culture\n* Iconography\n* Symbolism\n* American history\n* Black Hills\n* Native American history", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a rich history spanning over two centuries, this village has evolved from a thriving mill town to a popular summer-cottage resort, and eventually, a rural commuter town. In recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts, making it a desirable place to live, work, and visit.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Mill town (1826–1887)**\n\nBritannia Village was founded in 1826 as a mill town, with the construction of the Britannia Mills, a large textile factory that employed hundreds of workers. The village quickly grew around the mill, with workers' homes and businesses springing up to serve the community. The mill town era was marked by hard work and simple living, with many residents working long hours in the textile industry.\n\n### **Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)**\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village began to transform into a popular summer-cottage resort. With the construction of the Ottawa Valley Railway, the village became easily accessible by train, and wealthy families from Ottawa and other parts of the province built summer homes in the area. The village's scenic beauty, with its rolling hills, woodlands, and waterfront, made it an attractive destination for those seeking a peaceful retreat from the city.\n\n#### **Engineering feats**\n\nDuring this period, Britannia Village underwent significant engineering feats, including the construction of the Britannia Water Treatment Plant, which provided clean drinking water to the village and surrounding areas. The plant's innovative design and technology made it a model for other water treatment facilities in the region.\n\n#### **Britannia Amusement Park**\n\nIn the early 20th century, Britannia Village was home to the Britannia Amusement Park, a popular destination for families and thrill-seekers. The park featured a range of attractions, including a roller coaster, a ferris wheel, and a picnic area. Although the park is no longer in operation, its legacy lives on in the memories of those who visited.\n\n### **Rural commuter town (1960–2000)**\n\nFollowing World War II, Britannia Village underwent significant changes as the textile industry declined, and residents began to commute to Ottawa for work. The village's population swelled with the arrival of new families, and the community became more diverse. During this period, the village's infrastructure was upgraded, with the construction of new roads, schools, and community facilities.\n\n### **Revitalization (since 2000)**\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts, aimed at preserving its heritage and promoting sustainable growth. One of the key initiatives was the implementation of flood-proofing measures to protect the village from the Ottawa River, which flows through the area.\n\n#### **Flood proofing**\n\nThe flood-proofing initiative involved the construction of a new dike system, designed to protect the village from flooding during heavy rainfall events. The project also included the installation of stormwater management systems and the creation of a green space along the riverfront.\n\n#### **Gentrification**\n\nAs part of the revitalization efforts, Britannia Village has experienced gentrification, with new businesses, restaurants, and shops opening in the area. The village's historic homes have been restored, and many have been converted into trendy boutiques and cafes. While some long-time residents have expressed concerns about the changes, many see the revitalization as a positive force that has transformed the village into a vibrant and desirable place to live.\n\n**Heritage buildings and architectural style**\n\nBritannia Village is home to a range of heritage buildings, including the historic Britannia Mills, which has been converted into a residential complex. Other notable heritage buildings include the village's original schoolhouse, now a museum, and the Britannia Water Treatment Plant, which has been designated as a National Historic Site.\n\n### **Addresses of buildings with heritage status**\n\nSome of the addresses of buildings with heritage status in Britannia Village include:\n\n* 100 Britannia Road, the Britannia Mills\n* 200 Britannia Road, the village's original schoolhouse\n* 500 Britannia Road, the Britannia Water Treatment Plant\n\n### **Heritage attributes in modern residences**\n\nMany modern residences in Britannia Village incorporate heritage attributes, such as exposed brick walls, wooden beams, and original windows. Some homes have been designed to reflect the village's original architecture, with features such as dormer windows and clapboard siding.\n\n**Character**\n\nBritannia Village is known for its charming character, with a strong sense of community and a rich history. The village's residents are proud of their heritage and work together to preserve the area's natural beauty and cultural significance.\n\n**Notables in the community**\n\nSome notable residents of Britannia Village include:\n\n* Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister, who owned a summer home in the village\n* William Lyon Mackenzie King, Canada's 10th prime minister, who visited the village regularly\n* The Macpherson family, who were prominent residents of the village and owned a large estate in the area\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Britannia Village is a unique and fascinating place, with a rich history and a strong sense of community.\n* The village's revitalization efforts have transformed it into a desirable place to live, work, and visit.\n* The village's heritage buildings and natural beauty make it a popular destination for tourists and history buffs.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources: Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa Valley Railway, Britannia Water Treatment Plant, National Historic Sites of Canada, Britannia Village Residents Association.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Britannia_Village,_Ottawa\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Mill town (1826–1887)\n##Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n###Engineering feats\n###Britannia Amusement Park\n##Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n##Revitalization (since 2000)\n###Flood proofing\n###Gentrification\n#Heritage buildings and architectural style\n##Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n##Heritage attributes in modern residences\n#Character\n#Notables in the community\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is characterized by a focus on the use of law and punishment to maintain social order and govern society. Legalism is often seen as a reaction to the more philosophical and idealistic Confucianism, which emphasized personal morality and ethics.\n\nRetrospective current\n--------------------\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nThe earliest known Legalist text is the \"Chapter 43 Ding fa\" from the Shangjun shu, a book attributed to the Legalist strategist Shang Yang. This chapter provides a detailed explanation of the principles of Legalist governance, including the importance of clear laws, strict punishments, and a strong centralized authority.\n\n### Imperial Confucian category\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, Legalism was categorized as one of the six schools of thought in the Imperial Confucian canon. However, this categorization was not without controversy, as some scholars saw Legalism as being in conflict with the more philosophical and moralistic Confucianism.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n---------------------\n\nOne of the key aspects of Legalist philosophy is the use of military force to maintain social order and discipline. Legalist strategists believed that a strong military was essential for the survival of the state, and that the use of force was necessary to maintain social control. This emphasis on military mobilization was reflected in the development of the Legalist concept of the \"state of war,\" in which the state was seen as being in a constant state of conflict with its enemies.\n\nSima Qian\n----------\n\nThe historian Sima Qian is often seen as a key figure in the development of Legalism. In his history, the Records of the Grand Historian, Sima Qian provides a detailed account of the Legalist philosophy and its application in Chinese history. However, Sima Qian's work also reflects a strong Confucian bias, and his treatment of Legalism is often critical and dismissive.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n-----------------------\n\nThe discovery of the Mawangdui texts in 1973 provided a significant amount of new information about the development of Legalism. These texts, which date from the Warring States period, provide a detailed account of the Huang-Lao philosophy, which emphasized the importance of the balance of yin and yang and the use of military force to maintain social order.\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Huang-Lao philosophy is often seen as being closely related to the philosophy of Laozi, the founder of Daoism. However, the exact relationship between Huang-Lao and Laozi is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nThe philosopher Shen Dao is often seen as a key figure in the development of Legalism, and his work is often seen as being closely related to the philosophy of Zhuangzi. However, the exact relationship between Shen Dao and Zhuangzi is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\nChanging with the times\n----------------------\n\nIn the centuries following the fall of the Qin dynasty, Legalism underwent significant changes and developments. The philosopher A.C. Graham argued that Legalism was undergoing a process of \"mutual assimilation\" with other philosophical traditions, including Confucianism and Daoism.\n\n### A.C. Graham\n\nGraham's work on Legalism is often seen as being a key influence on modern understandings of the tradition. However, his work also reflects a strong Eurocentric bias, and his treatment of Legalism is often critical and dismissive.\n\nConfucian influences\n-------------------\n\nDespite its reputation as a more \"scientific\" and \"practical\" philosophy, Legalism was heavily influenced by Confucianism. The philosopher Shen Dao, for example, was heavily influenced by Confucian ideas about the importance of personal morality and ethics.\n\n### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao's work is often seen as being a key example of the influence of Confucianism on Legalism. However, the exact nature of Shen Dao's relationship to Confucianism is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n---------------------\n\nThe Legalist concept of xing-ming, or \"human nature,\" is often seen as being closely related to the Daoist concept of wu wei, or \"non-action.\" However, the exact relationship between the two is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\nHan Feizi\n----------\n\nThe philosopher Han Feizi is often seen as a key figure in the development of Legalism. His work, the Han Feizi, provides a detailed account of the principles of Legalist governance, including the importance of clear laws, strict punishments, and a strong centralized authority.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nThe Daodejing, a foundational text of Daoism, contains a passage that is often seen as being closely related to the Legalist concept of xing-ming. However, the exact nature of the relationship between the two is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\nSchool of names\n----------------\n\nThe School of Names, a philosophical tradition that emerged during the Warring States period, is often seen as being closely related to Legalism. However, the exact nature of the relationship between the two is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\nEradicating punishments\n----------------------\n\nThe Legalist concept of eradicating punishments, or \"abolishing the laws,\" is often seen as being a key aspect of the tradition. However, the exact nature of the concept is not clear, and some scholars see it as being mutually contradictory.\n\n### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi's work provides a detailed account of the principles of Legalist governance, including the importance of clear laws, strict punishments, and a strong centralized authority.\n\n### Justice\n\nThe Legalist concept of justice is often seen as being closely related to the concept of \"punishment,\" or \"penalty.\" However, the exact nature of the relationship between the two is not clear, and some scholars see the two as being mutually contradictory.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n---------------------------\n\nThe Legalist tradition has a rich and complex mythological history, with a number of key figures and events that are often seen as being central to the tradition. However, the exact nature of the mythological history is not clear, and some scholars see it as being mutually contradictory.\n\n### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi, a Chinese historian and philosopher, is often seen as being a key figure in the development of Legalism. His work, the Discourses of Jia Yi, provides a detailed account of the principles of Legalist governance, including the importance of clear laws, strict punishments, and a strong centralized authority.\n\n### Liu An (179–122 BCE)\n\nLiu An, a Chinese philosopher and king, is often seen as being a key figure in the development of Legalism. His work, the Huainanzi, provides a detailed account of the principles of Legalist governance, including the importance of clear laws, strict punishments, and a strong centralized authority.\n\n### The Fa School\n\nThe Fa School, a philosophical tradition that emerged during the Han dynasty, is often seen as being closely related to Legalism.

It is presented annually to the QMJHL's most outstanding player, as voted on by members of the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) and QMJHL media. The trophy was established in 1961 by the late John Herder, a Canadian businessman and hockey enthusiast, in memory of his son, who died in a tragic accident.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was first awarded in 1961 to Patrick Dandurand, a talented right winger who played for the Quebec Remparts. The trophy was initially awarded to the QMJHL's most valuable player, but in 1968, the CHL introduced the Memorial Cup, and the Herder Trophy became the QMJHL's equivalent to the CHL's most outstanding player award.\n\n**The Herder Family**\n\nJohn Herder, a successful businessman and hockey enthusiast, was born in 1890 in Montreal, Quebec. He was a member of the prominent Herder family, which was involved in various business ventures, including real estate and manufacturing. John Herder was a passionate hockey fan and had a deep love for the game, which was passed down to his son, who died tragically in 1959 at the age of 21. The Herder family was known for their philanthropic efforts, particularly in the area of youth hockey development.\n\n**The Trophy**\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver trophy with a distinctive shape, featuring a maple leaf design on the front. The trophy is approximately 18 inches tall and weighs around 5 pounds. The trophy is engraved with the names of the winners since its inception in 1961.\n\n**Conditions placed by the trophy donor**\n\nJohn Herder, in his will, specified several conditions for the trophy, which were to be met by the QMJHL and CHL. The conditions were as follows:\n\n* The trophy was to be awarded annually to the QMJHL's most outstanding player.\n* The trophy was to be presented at the QMJHL's season-ending banquet.\n* The trophy was to be engraved with the names of the winners.\n* The QMJHL was to provide a suitable trophy case for the Herder Memorial Trophy.\n\n**Exceptions to the original conditions**\n\nOver the years, several exceptions have been made to the original conditions. Some of these exceptions include:\n\n### Condition #2\n\nIn 1970, the CHL decided to introduce the Memorial Cup, which would be awarded to the winner of the CHL's playoffs. As a result, the Herder Trophy was no longer awarded to the QMJHL's most valuable player, but rather to the QMJHL's most outstanding player, as voted on by members of the CHL and QMJHL media.\n\n### Condition #4\n\nIn 1980, the QMJHL introduced the President's Cup, which would be awarded to the winner of the QMJHL's playoffs. The Herder Trophy was no longer awarded to the QMJHL's most outstanding player, but rather to the QMJHL's most outstanding player, as voted on by members of the CHL and QMJHL media.\n\n### Condition #7\n\nIn 1990, the CHL introduced the CHL Players' Association, which would represent the interests of CHL players. As a result, the Herder Trophy was no longer awarded to the QMJHL's most outstanding player, but rather to the QMJHL's most outstanding player, as voted on by members of the CHL and QMJHL media.\n\n**Series format**\n\nThe Herder Trophy is awarded as part of the QMJHL's playoffs. The format of the playoffs has changed over the years, but currently, the QMJHL's playoffs consist of a best-of-seven series between the top 8 teams in the league. The winner of the QMJHL's playoffs is awarded the President's Cup.\n\n### Series format history\n\nThe QMJHL's playoffs have undergone several format changes over the years. The current format, which consists of a best-of-seven series between the top 8 teams in the league, was introduced in 1990.\n\n**Herder Champions**\n\nSince its inception in 1961, a total of 54 players have won the Herder Memorial Trophy. Some notable winners include:\n\n* Patrick Dandurand (1961)\n* Jean-Guy Talbot (1965)\n* Réjean Houle (1970)\n* Michel Brière (1971)\n* Mario Tremblay (1973)\n* Michel Goulet (1978)\n* Pat LaFontaine (1985)\n* Eric Lindros (1990)\n\n**Presentation ceremony and final game results**\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is presented annually at the QMJHL's season-ending banquet. The winner of the trophy is announced at the banquet, and the trophy is presented to the winner.\n\n**Finals appearances**\n\nA total of 54 players have won the Herder Memorial Trophy, and 46 of those players have appeared in the QMJHL's finals.\n\n**Cliff Gorman Memorial Award winners**\n\nThe Cliff Gorman Memorial Award is awarded annually to the QMJHL's most outstanding coach. The award is named after Cliff Gorman, a former QMJHL coach who was known for his dedication to the game.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nThe QMJHL's playoffs are broadcast annually by various television networks, including RDS and TSN. The broadcasts are typically hosted by a team of commentators, who provide play-by-play and color commentary throughout the playoffs.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bibliography\n\nThis article is based on primary and secondary sources, including:\n\n* The QMJHL's official website\n* The CHL's official website\n* Various hockey publications and news outlets\n\nNote: This article is not a comprehensive bibliography, but rather a selection of sources used to research the article.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The QMJHL's official website\n* The CHL's official website\n* The Herder Memorial Trophy's official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Herder_Memorial_Trophy\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#The Herder family\n#The trophy\n#Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n##Exceptions to the original conditions\n###Condition #2\n###Condition #4\n###Condition #7\n#Series format\n##Series format history\n#Herder Champions\n#Presentation ceremony and final game results\n#Finals appearances\n#Cliff Gorman Memorial Award winners\n#Broadcasting\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event took place at the Tallinn Ice Hall in Tallinn, Estonia, from March 21 to 27, 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 World Figure Skating Championships was the 121st edition of the World Figure Skating Championships. The event was originally scheduled to take place in Montpellier, France, from March 22 to 28, 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was postponed to 2022. The event was later relocated to Tallinn, Estonia.\n\n### Controversy\n\nThere was controversy surrounding the qualification process for the event. The International Skating Union (ISU) had changed the qualification rules, allowing the host country to have a full slate of entries in all disciplines. This led to criticism from other countries, who felt that it was unfair to the athletes who had worked hard to qualify for the event.\n\nThe ISU defended the decision, stating that it was a one-time exception due to the pandemic and that it would not impact the qualification process for future events. However, the controversy continued to simmer, with some countries calling for a return to the traditional qualification process.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships was based on the ISU World Standings. Athletes earned points for their performances in ISU-sanctioned events, and the top-ranked athletes in each discipline qualified for the event.\n\n### Age and minimum TES requirements\n\nAthletes were required to be at least 15 years old to compete in the men's singles event, 15 years old to compete in the ladies' singles event, and 16 years old to compete in the pairs and ice dance events. Athletes were also required to meet minimum technical element scores (TES) in order to be eligible for the event.\n\n### Number of entries per discipline\n\nEach country was allowed to enter a maximum of three athletes in each discipline. The host country, Estonia, was allowed to have a full slate of entries in all disciplines, for a total of 12 entries.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe schedule for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships was as follows:\n\n* March 21: Men's short program\n* March 22: Women's short program\n* March 23: Pairs short program\n* March 24: Ice dance rhythm dance\n* March 25: Men's free program\n* March 26: Women's free program and Pairs free skate\n* March 27: Ice dance free dance\n\n**Entries**\n\nThe preliminary entries for the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships were announced on March 1, 2022. A total of 168 athletes from 44 countries entered the event.\n\n### Changes to preliminary entries\n\nDue to the controversy surrounding the qualification process, some countries withdrew their preliminary entries. The ISU allowed countries to withdraw their entries up until the deadline for the final entries, which was March 14, 2022.\n\n**Medal summary**\n\n| Discipline | Gold | Silver | Bronze |\n| Men's singles |  Nathan Chen (USA) |  Shoma Uno (JPN) |  Vincent Zhou (USA) |\n| Women's singles |  Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) |  Alexandra Trusova (RUS) |  Anastasia Gubanova (RUS) |\n| Pairs |  Sui Wenjing / Han Cong (CHN) |  Riku Miura / Ryuichi Kihara (JPN) |  Evgenia Tarasova / Vladimir Morozov (RUS) |\n| Ice dance |  Madison Chock / Evan Bates (USA) |  Madison Hubbell / Zachary Donohue (USA) |  Sofia Shevchenko / Igor Eremenko (RUS) |\n\n### Medals by country\n\n| Rank | Country | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| 1 |  Japan | 1 | 3 | 0 | 4 |\n| 2 |  United States | 3 | 2 | 1 | 6 |\n| 3 |  China | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 4 |  Russia | 0 | 1 | 4 | 5 |\n\n**Records**\n\nThe following records were set at the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships:\n\n* Men's short program: Nathan Chen (USA) set a new record for the men's short program with a score of 104.72.\n* Women's short program: Kaori Sakamoto (JPN) set a new record for the women's short program with a score of 80.24.\n* Pairs short program: Sui Wenjing / Han Cong (CHN) set a new record for the pairs short program with a score of 73.90.\n* Ice dance rhythm dance: Madison Chock / Evan Bates (USA) set a new record for the ice dance rhythm dance with a score of 87.51.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Men's singles\n\n| Rank | Name | Nation | Total | SP | FS |\n| 1 | Nathan Chen |  United States | 295.72 | 1 | 104.72 | 1 | 191.00 |\n| 2 | Shoma Uno |  Japan | 284.73 | 2 | 97.74 | 2 | 186.99 |\n| 3 | Vincent Zhou |  United States | 266.21 | 5 | 93.52 | 3 | 172.69 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n### Women's singles\n\n| Rank | Name | Nation | Total | SP | FS |\n| 1 | Kaori Sakamoto |  Japan | 225.53 | 1 | 80.24 | 1 | 145.29 |\n| 2 | Alexandra Trusova |  Russia | 217.44 | 2 | 74.92 | 2 | 142.52 |\n| 3 | Anastasia Gubanova |  Russia | 214.45 | 3 | 73.63 | 3 | 140.82 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n### Pairs\n\n| Rank | Name | Nation | Total | SP | FS |\n| 1 | Sui Wenjing / Han Cong |  China | 233.71 | 1 | 73.90 | 1 | 159.81 |\n| 2 | Riku Miura / Ryuichi Kihara |  Japan | 226.87 | 2 | 72.49 | 2 | 154.38 |\n| 3 | Evgenia Tarasova / Vladimir Morozov |  Russia | 225.04 | 3 | 71.75 | 3 | 153.29 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n### Ice dance\n\n| Rank | Name | Nation | Total | RD | FD |\n| 1 | Madison Chock / Evan Bates |  United States | 224.29 | 1 | 87.51 | 1 | 136.78 |\n| 2 | Madison Hubbell / Zachary Donohue |  United States | 219.04 | 2 | 85.84 | 2 | 133.20 |\n| 3 | Sofia Shevchenko / Igor Eremenko |  Russia | 214.62 | 3 | 84.39 | 3 | 130.23 |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the 2022 World Figure Skating Championships", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_World_Figure_Skating_Championships\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Controversy\n#Qualification\n##Age and minimum TES requirements\n##Number of entries per discipline\n#Schedule\n#Entries\n##Changes to preliminary entries\n#Medal summary\n##Medalists\n##Medals by country\n#Records\n#Results\n##Men's singles\n##Women's singles\n##Pairs\n##Ice dance\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is part of the Lesser Antilles archipelago and is situated approximately 22 miles (35 kilometers) north of the island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The island has a total area of approximately 238 square miles (617 square kilometers) and a population of around 178,000 people.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Saint Lucia\" is derived from the name of the Christian martyr Saint Lucy, who is revered by the island's indigenous people, the Caribs, as a symbol of light and hope. The island's name was first recorded by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, who referred to it as \"Santa Lucia\".\n\n**History**\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nThe island of Saint Lucia has been inhabited for thousands of years, with the first known inhabitants being the Caribs, an indigenous people who migrated to the island from the mainland of South America. The Caribs were skilled farmers, fishermen, and craftsmen, and they developed a complex society with a rich culture and tradition. They were also skilled warriors, and their island was a major center of trade and commerce in the pre-colonial era.\n\n### Early European period\n\nIn 1502, the Spanish explorer Juan de Bermúdez became the first European to sight the island of Saint Lucia. Over the next several decades, the Spanish established a series of settlements on the island, but they were eventually driven out by the Caribs. In 1660, the French established a settlement on the island, which became a major center of trade and commerce. The French brought enslaved Africans to the island, who were forced to work on plantations and in other industries.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nIn 1718, the British captured the island of Saint Lucia from the French, and it remained a British colony for over a century. During this period, the British established a series of plantations on the island, which were worked by enslaved Africans. The British also built a number of infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the early 20th century, Saint Lucia began to move towards independence from Britain. In 1924, the island was granted internal self-government, and in 1958, it became part of the West Indies Federation, a grouping of Caribbean islands that was aimed at promoting economic and cultural unity. In 1962, Saint Lucia joined the British Commonwealth, and in 1979, it became an independent nation.\n\n### Post-independence era\n\nIn the post-independence era, Saint Lucia has continued to develop its economy and infrastructure. The island has become a major tourist destination, with a focus on eco-tourism and cultural heritage tourism. The island has also invested in its education and healthcare systems, and has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards.\n\n**Geography**\n\n### Climate\n\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 70°F (21°C) to 90°F (32°C) throughout the year.

The state funeral, held on 19 September 2022, was a grand ceremony that brought together leaders from around the world to pay their respects to the late monarch.\n\n**Background**\n\nElizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926, to Prince Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She ascended to the throne on 6 February 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI. During her reign, she became the longest-reigning British monarch, earning widespread respect and admiration for her dedication to duty and her role as a symbol of national identity.\n\n**Death and National Mourning**\n\n**Death and Announcement**\n\nElizabeth II passed away at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, at the age of 96, on 8 September 2022. The announcement of her death was made by Buckingham Palace at 8:30 am local time, with a statement on the palace's website confirming the news. The palace also announced that a period of national mourning would begin, with flags flying at half-mast across the UK.\n\n**Scottish Events**\n\nThe death of the monarch was met with an outpouring of grief in Scotland, where Elizabeth II had spent many summers at Balmoral Castle. Thousands of people gathered outside the castle, leaving flowers, cards, and messages of condolence. In Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, a book of condolences was opened at the Scottish Parliament, where politicians and members of the public came to pay their respects.\n\n**Lying-in-State**\n\nThe lying-in-state of Elizabeth II took place at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, from 12 September to 15 September 2022. The Queen's coffin, draped in the Royal Standard, was placed in the Throne Room, where it was viewed by thousands of people who came to pay their respects. The queue to view the coffin stretched for miles, with many people waiting for hours or even overnight to glimpse the Queen's coffin.\n\n### Queue\n\nThe queue to view the Queen's coffin was a remarkable sight, with people from all walks of life coming to pay their respects. The queue was managed by the Royal Family and the Scottish authorities, who worked tirelessly to ensure that everyone who wanted to view the coffin was able to do so. The queue was estimated to be over 2 miles long at its peak, with some people waiting for up to 24 hours to reach the Palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\n**State Funeral**\n\n**Planning**\n\nThe state funeral of Elizabeth II was planned by the Royal Family and the UK government, with the help of other countries and international organizations. The funeral was a grand ceremony that brought together leaders from around the world to pay their respects to the late monarch.
