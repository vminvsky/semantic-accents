This approach is in contrast to the classical approach, which relies on the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) and the Axiom of Choice (AC). Constructive set theory has its roots in intuitionistic mathematics, which was developed by L.E.J. Brouwer in the early 20th century.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a formal system that rejects the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM), which states that for any proposition P, either P or not P is true. In intuitionistic logic, a proposition may be neither true nor false. This allows for a more nuanced and constructive approach to mathematics.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes certain restrictions on the set theory, such as the use of intuitionistic logic, the rejection of the Axiom of Choice (AC), and the emphasis on explicit algorithms and witnesses.

The protest, which began in February 2023, gained national and international attention, highlighting issues of corruption, harassment, and lack of accountability in Indian sports.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe protest was sparked by allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Indian wrestlers, including Olympic medal winners, by officials of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). The allegations, which emerged in January 2023, were followed by a series of protests by wrestlers, who demanded action against the accused officials and reforms in the federation.\n\n**Initial Investigation**\n\nThe Indian government launched an investigation into the allegations, with a team of police officers from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) tasked with gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. The investigation, which was led by the CBI, focused on the allegations of harassment and assault against the WFI officials.\n\n**Protest Overview**\n\nThe protest, which was led by the Indian wrestlers, began on February 25, 2023, with a rally in New Delhi's Jantar Mantar. The protesters, who included wrestlers, coaches, and officials, demanded that the government take action against the accused officials and reform the WFI. The protest, which was largely peaceful, was marked by the presence of women and children, who were also affected by the allegations.\n\n#### FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention\n\nOn February 27, 2023, the police registered an FIR against the WFI officials, following the submission of evidence by the wrestlers. The FIR was registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman), 354A (sexual harassment), and 506 (criminal intimidation). The Supreme Court of India, which was approached by the wrestlers, intervened in the matter, directing the government to take action against the accused officials and reform the WFI.\n\n#### Jantar Mantar Clash\n\nOn February 28, 2023, a clash broke out between the protesters and the police at Jantar Mantar, with protesters attempting to break through police barricades. The police, who used tear gas and baton charges to disperse the crowd, arrested several protesters, including wrestlers and officials. The clash, which was widely covered by the media, highlighted the tensions between the protesters and the police.\n\n#### Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses\n\nFollowing the clash, the government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the allegations. The SIT, which was headed by a senior police officer, began questioning the witnesses, including the wrestlers and officials. The questioning, which was conducted in a transparent manner, aimed to gather evidence and build a case against the accused officials.\n\n#### New Parliament House March and Detainment\n\nOn March 1, 2023, the protesters marched towards the New Parliament House, demanding that the government take action against the accused officials.

The chargesheet, which was filed under the IPC sections 354, 354A, and 506, alleged that the officials had committed acts of harassment and assault against the wrestlers.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe protest, which lasted for several days, had a significant impact on the Indian wrestling community and the sports ministry. The government, which was criticized for its handling of the situation, was forced to take action against the accused officials and reform the WFI. The protest also highlighted issues of corruption and lack of accountability in Indian sports.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe reaction to the protest was largely divided, with some supporting the wrestlers and others criticizing them.\n\n#### Domestic\n\nCriticism of the protest came from several quarters, including the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), which criticized the wrestlers for taking to the streets. The IOA, which is the apex body for Olympic sports in India, argued that the wrestlers should have pursued a more conventional route to address their grievances. However, many others, including sports experts and activists, supported the wrestlers, arguing that their protest was justified and necessary.\n\n**International**\n\nThe international response to the protest was also mixed, with some organizations and individuals supporting the wrestlers and others criticizing them.\n\n#### United World Wrestling\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW), which is the international governing body for wrestling, condemned the allegations of harassment and assault against the wrestlers. The UWW, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland, also supported the wrestlers' demand for reforms in the WFI.\n\n#### International Olympic Committee\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is the supreme governing body for Olympic sports, also condemned the allegations of harassment and assault against the wrestlers.

The parliamentarians, who argued that the government had failed to address the grievances of the wrestlers, demanded action against the accused officials and reforms in the WFI.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe protest, which was widely covered by the media, highlighted the issues of corruption and lack of accountability in Indian sports. The media coverage, which was largely supportive of the wrestlers, helped to raise awareness about the allegations and the demand for reforms.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe protest had a significant impact on the Indian wrestling community and the sports ministry.

It is a common and usually benign condition, but can be a source of concern for parents and caregivers. This article provides an overview of febrile seizures, including their signs and symptoms, causes, mechanism, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n--------------------\n\n### Types\n\nFebrile seizures can be classified into two main types: simple and complex.\n\n*   **Simple febrile seizures**: These seizures are characterized by a single episode of fever-related seizure, lasting less than 15 minutes, and no recurrence within 24 hours. They are the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for approximately 70% of cases.\n*   **Complex febrile seizures**: These seizures involve multiple episodes of fever-related seizures, lasting more than 15 minutes, or recurrence within 24 hours. They are less common, occurring in approximately 30% of cases.\n\n### Other symptoms\n\nIn addition to seizures, children with febrile seizures may exhibit other symptoms, including:\n\n*   Fever, typically above 38.3°C (101°F)\n*   Vomiting\n*   Irritability\n*   Confusion\n*   Loss of consciousness\n\n**Causes**\n---------\n\nFebrile seizures are most often associated with viral infections, such as:\n\n*   Respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus)\n*   Meningococcal infections (e.g., meningitis)\n*   Urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis)\n*   Gastrointestinal infections (e.g., gastroenteritis)\n\nOther potential causes of febrile seizures include:\n\n*   Bacterial infections\n*   Medications (e.g., antibiotics, vaccines)\n*   Environmental factors (e.g., heat, humidity)\n\n**Mechanism**\n------------\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, in response to fever. This can lead to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, resulting in seizures.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n------------\n\nDiagnosing febrile seizures can be challenging, as the symptoms are similar to those of other conditions. A diagnosis is typically made based on the following criteria:\n\n*   Presence of fever\n*   Seizure activity\n*   Absence of other underlying medical conditions that could cause seizures\n\nA thorough medical history and physical examination can help rule out other potential causes of seizures.\n\n**Prevention**\n------------\n\nWhile it is not possible to prevent febrile seizures entirely, there are several steps parents and caregivers can take to reduce the risk:\n\n*   Keep children up to date on vaccinations\n*   Avoid overmedicating children with antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen)\n*   Monitor temperature closely and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen\n*   Maintain a calm and reassuring environment during febrile episodes\n\n**Treatment**\n------------\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves:\n\n*   Providing a safe environment to prevent injury\n*   Administering antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) to reduce fever\n*   Offering hydration and rest\n*   Monitoring for signs of complications (e.g., status epilepticus)\n\nIn some cases, medication may be prescribed to prevent recurrent seizures.\n\n**Prognosis**\n------------\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good, with most children recovering fully from the episode. However, some children may experience:\n\n*   Recurrent febrile seizures\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Behavioral problems\n\nIn rare cases, febrile seizures can be a precursor to epilepsy, but this is not typically the case.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n----------------\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 2-5% of children under the age of 5. They are more common in:\n\n*   Children under 3 years old\n*   Children with a family history of febrile seizures\n*   Children with certain underlying medical conditions (e.g., heart defects)\n\nWhile febrile seizures can be alarming, they are usually a benign condition that resolves on its own. By understanding the signs and symptoms, causes, mechanism, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology of febrile seizures, parents and caregivers can provide the best possible care for their child.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party was founded in 1991 and has since become a significant force in California politics.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Green Party of California was founded in 1991 by a group of environmentalists and activists who were dissatisfied with the two major parties in California, the Democratic and Republican parties. The party's early leaders were committed to the principles of the Green Party, which include environmental protection, social justice, and nonviolent conflict resolution. The party's first election campaign was in 1992, when they ran a candidate for Governor of California.\n\n### Qualifying for elections\n\nTo qualify for elections in California, the Green Party of California must meet the state's ballot access requirements. These requirements, set by the California Secretary of State's office, include gathering a certain number of signatures from registered voters in order to appear on the ballot. The party must also pay a filing fee, which is currently set at $3,500. In addition, the party must submit a list of its candidates and a copy of its party bylaws to the California Secretary of State's office.\n\n### Electoral milestones\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several electoral milestones since its founding. In 1992, the party's candidate for Governor of California, Dan Hamburg, received 4.2% of the vote. In 1994, the party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor of California, Jim Holcomb, received 3.2% of the vote. In 2000, the party's candidate for President of the United States, Ralph Nader, received 2.9% of the vote in California.\n\n### Top-two primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters approved Proposition 14, which changed the state's primary election system to a top-two primary system. Under this system, voters can choose any candidate on the ballot in the primary election, and the top two candidates with the most votes advance to the general election. The Green Party of California has argued that this system is unfair to third-party candidates, as it makes it difficult for them to qualify for the general election.\n\n**Platform**\n\nThe Green Party of California's platform is based on the party's national platform, which includes the following principles:\n\n* Environmental protection: the party advocates for the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development.\n* Social justice: the party advocates for social justice and equality for all people, regardless of their race, gender, or economic status.\n* Nonviolent conflict resolution: the party advocates for nonviolent conflict resolution and the promotion of peace and justice.\n* Grassroots democracy: the party advocates for grassroots democracy and the involvement of citizens in the decision-making process.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe Green Party of California is a democratic organization, with a membership of over 10,000 people. The party is governed by a State Central Committee, which is made up of delegates elected by the party's members. The State Central Committee is responsible for setting the party's platform and policies, as well as overseeing the party's election campaigns.\n\n### Membership\n\nThe Green Party of California has over 10,000 members, who are committed to the party's principles and goals. Members are eligible to vote in party elections and to hold leadership positions within the party. The party also has a network of local chapters and caucuses, which provide a forum for members to discuss issues and participate in the decision-making process.\n\n**Current elected officials**\n\nThe Green Party of California has several elected officials at the local and state levels. These include:\n\n* Mayors: the party has elected mayors in several cities, including Berkeley, Fairfax, and Sebastopol.\n* Municipal councils: the party has elected members to municipal councils in several cities, including San Francisco, Oakland, and San Diego.\n* School boards: the party has elected members to school boards in several districts, including the San Francisco Unified School District and the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\n### Mayoral offices\n\nThe Green Party of California has elected mayors in several cities, including:\n\n* Berkeley: Jesse Arreguin\n* Fairfax: Camille Turner\n* Sebastopol: Larry Barnett\n\n### Municipal councils\n\nThe Green Party of California has elected members to municipal councils in several cities, including:\n\n* San Francisco: Aaron Peskin, Eric Mar, and Sandra Fewer\n* Oakland: Dan Kalb, Dan Siegel, and Noel Gallo\n* San Diego: Tony Young\n\n**Election results**\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several notable election results, including:\n\n* Presidential elections: in 2000, Ralph Nader received 2.9% of the vote in California, finishing third behind Al Gore and George W. Bush.\n* Gubernatorial elections: in 2010, the party's candidate for Governor of California, Laura Wells, received 1.1% of the vote.\n* Election qualifying: in 2014, the party's candidate for Governor of California, Cindy Sheehan, failed to qualify for the ballot due to a lack of signatures.\n\n### Presidential\n\nThe Green Party of California has nominated candidates for President of the United States in several elections, including:\n\n* 2000: Ralph Nader\n* 2004: David Cobb\n* 2008: Cynthia McKinney\n* 2012: Jill Stein\n\n### Gubernatorial\n\nThe Green Party of California has nominated candidates for Governor of California in several elections, including:\n\n* 1992: Dan Hamburg\n* 1994: Jim Holcomb\n* 2002: Peter Camejo\n* 2010: Laura Wells\n* 2014: Cindy Sheehan\n\n### Election qualifying\n\nThe Green Party of California has struggled with election qualifying in several elections, including:\n\n* 2014: Cindy Sheehan failed to qualify for the ballot due to a lack of signatures.\n* 2020: The party's candidate for President of the United States, Howie Hawkins, failed to qualify for the ballot due to a lack of signatures.\n\n**Notable members**\n\nThe Green Party of California has had several notable members, including:\n\n* Ralph Nader: presidential candidate and environmental activist\n* Cynthia McKinney: presidential candidate and former U.S. Representative\n* Jesse Ventura: former Governor of Minnesota and Green Party candidate for President\n* Noam Chomsky: linguist and political activist\n* Cheri Honkala: vice-presidential candidate and community organizer\n\n**See also**\n\n* Green Party of the United States\n* Environmentalism\n* Nonviolence\n* Social justice\n* Grassroots democracy\n* Electoral politics\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Green Party of California has been a registered political party in the state since 1992.\n* The party's national platform is based on the Ten Key Values of the Green Party.\n* The party has a strong presence in California's coastal regions, where environmentalism is a major issue.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* None\n\n**References**\n\n* Green Party of California.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of philosophy, particularly in the fields of German Idealism and the history of philosophy. Hegel's philosophical system, which emphasizes the absolute spirit and the dialectical process, has had a profound impact on Western philosophy and continues to influence contemporary thought.\n\n# **Life**\n\n## **Formative years**\n\n### **Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)**\n\nHegel was born into a family of modest means, his father working as a secretary for the Duke of Württemberg. He was raised in a devoutly Lutheran household, which would later influence his philosophical views. In 1788, Hegel enrolled at the Tübinger Stift, a theological seminary in Tübingen, where he studied philosophy, theology, and classical languages. It was during this period that he developed an interest in philosophy, particularly the works of Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. After completing his studies in 1793, Hegel moved to Berne, Switzerland, where he worked as a tutor for a wealthy family. In 1797, he moved to Frankfurt, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt.\n\n## **Career years**\n\n### **Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)**\n\nIn 1801, Hegel accepted a position as a professor of philosophy at the University of Jena, where he met his future wife, Marie von Tucher. During his time at Jena, Hegel developed his philosophical system, which he outlined in his seminal work, the _Phenomenology of Spirit_ (1807). However, his time at Jena was cut short due to the Napoleonic Wars, which led to the university's closure. In 1808, Hegel moved to Bamberg, where he worked as a government official, and later to Nuremberg, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Nuremberg.\n\n### **Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)**\n\nIn 1816, Hegel accepted a position as a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained until 1818. During this period, he developed his philosophy of history, which he outlined in his work, _The Lectures on the Philosophy of History_ (1822-1823). In 1818, Hegel moved to Berlin, where he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin, a position he held until his death in 1831.\n\n# **Influences**\n\nHegel's philosophical system was influenced by a range of thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Schelling. He was also influenced by the works of ancient Greek philosophers, such as Plato and Aristotle. Hegel's philosophy was characterized by its emphasis on the dialectical process, which he believed was the fundamental principle of reality.\n\n# **The Phenomenology of Spirit**\n\nThe _Phenomenology of Spirit_ (1807) is considered one of Hegel's most important works, in which he outlines his philosophical system. The work is divided into several sections, including the introduction, the consciousness, self-consciousness, reason, spirit, and absolute spirit. In this work, Hegel argues that consciousness is a process of self-discovery, in which the individual comes to recognize their own identity and unity with the absolute.\n\n# **Philosophical system**\n\nHegel's philosophical system is characterized by its emphasis on the absolute spirit and the dialectical process. The system consists of several components, including the science of logic, the philosophy of the real, the philosophy of nature, and the philosophy of spirit.\n\n## **Science of Logic**\n\nThe science of logic is the foundation of Hegel's philosophical system. In this work, he outlines the principles of logic, including the laws of thought and the categories of being. Hegel argues that logic is the study of the absolute, which is the ultimate reality.\n\n## **Philosophy of the real**\n\nThe philosophy of the real is the study of the world of experience, which is characterized by its impermanence and subjectivity. Hegel argues that the real is a process of becoming, in which the individual is constantly changing and developing.\n\n## **The Philosophy of Nature**\n\nThe philosophy of nature is the study of the natural world, which is characterized by its laws and principles. Hegel argues that the natural world is a system of interconnected processes, in which each part is related to and dependent on the others.\n\n## **The Philosophy of Spirit**\n\nThe philosophy of spirit is the study of human consciousness and experience. Hegel argues that the spirit is the highest form of reality, which is characterized by its freedom, self-awareness, and unity with the absolute.\n\n## **Subjective spirit**\n\nSubjective spirit is the study of individual consciousness and experience. Hegel argues that subjective spirit is characterized by its freedom, self-awareness, and creativity.\n\n## **Objective spirit**\n\nObjective spirit is the study of social and historical phenomena. Hegel argues that objective spirit is characterized by its institutions, laws, and social structures.\n\n## **Absolute spirit**\n\nAbsolute spirit is the highest form of reality, which is characterized by its unity and identity with the absolute. Hegel argues that absolute spirit is the ultimate goal of human existence, which is achieved through the process of self-discovery and self-realization.\n\n# **Philosophy of art**\n\nHegel's philosophy of art is the study of the relationship between art and reality. He argues that art is a process of self-expression and self-discovery, in which the artist reveals their own identity and unity with the absolute. Hegel's philosophy of art is characterized by its emphasis on the importance of beauty, truth, and freedom.\n\n# **Christianity**\n\nHegel's philosophy of Christianity is the study of the relationship between Christianity and reality.

Left Hegelians argue that Hegel's philosophy is a form of revolutionary socialism, while Right Hegelians argue that Hegel's philosophy is a form of conservative idealism.\n\n# **Philosophy of history**\n\nHegel's philosophy of history is the study of the relationship between history and reality. He argues that history is a process of self-discovery and self-realization, in which the individual comes to recognize their own identity and unity with the absolute.

Hegel's philosophy is also characterized by its emphasis on the importance of reason, self-awareness, and unity with the absolute.\n\n## **Thesis–antithesis–synthesis**\n\nHegel's philosophy is characterized by its emphasis on the thesis-antithesis-synthesis process, in which the individual comes to recognize their own identity and unity with the absolute.

The referendums were widely seen as a precursor to formal annexation by Russia, although the results were not recognized by the international community.\n\n# Background\n\nThe referendums were held in the aftermath of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. The invasion led to a significant escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which had been ongoing since 2014. In April 2022, Russian forces captured large parts of the Kherson Oblast in southern Ukraine, and in May 2022, they launched a major offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in eastern Ukraine.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian occupation authorities in the occupied territories. The votes were held in five regions: the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in eastern Ukraine, and the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in southern Ukraine. The referendums were scheduled to take place over four days, from September 23 to September 26, 2022.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe referendums asked voters whether they supported joining Russia as a federal subject. The exact wording of the question varied slightly depending on the region, but it was generally phrased as follows:\n\n* In the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts: \"Do you support the accession of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic to the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n* In the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts: \"Do you support the accession of the Kherson Oblast and the Zaporizhzhia Oblast to the Russian Federation as a federal subject?\"\n\n## Results\n\nThe results of the referendums were announced by the Russian occupation authorities shortly after the voting ended. According to the authorities, the referendums were approved by overwhelming majorities in all five regions.\n\n* In the Donetsk People's Republic, 97.5% of voters supported joining Russia, with a turnout of 72.3%.\n* In the Luhansk People's Republic, 98.4% of voters supported joining Russia, with a turnout of 73.5%.\n* In the Kherson Oblast, 87.5% of voters supported joining Russia, with a turnout of 75.1%.\n* In the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 93.3% of voters supported joining Russia, with a turnout of 74.8%.\n\n# Kherson Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nThe referendum in the Kherson Oblast asked voters whether they supported joining Russia as a federal subject.\n\n## Result\n\nThe results of the referendum in the Kherson Oblast were announced by the Russian occupation authorities on September 25, 2022. According to the authorities, 87.5% of voters supported joining Russia, with a turnout of 75.1%.\n\n# Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nThe referendum in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast asked voters whether they supported joining Russia as a federal subject.\n\n## Result\n\nThe results of the referendum in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast were announced by the Russian occupation authorities on September 25, 2022. According to the authorities, 93.3% of voters supported joining Russia, with a turnout of 74.8%.\n\n# Other planned locations\n\n## Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian occupation authorities initially planned to hold a referendum in the Mykolaiv Oblast, but the voting was postponed indefinitely due to the ongoing military conflict in the region.\n\n## Kharkiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian occupation authorities also planned to hold a referendum in the Kharkiv Oblast, but the voting was postponed indefinitely due to the ongoing military conflict in the region.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the occupied territories suggested that a majority of voters supported joining Russia.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution. Madison was a key figure in the drafting of the Bill of Rights and played a leading role in the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party. He served as a congressman, secretary of state, and president, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in American history.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJames Madison was born in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the eldest of 12 children and grew up on the family's plantation, Montpelier. Madison's father was a planter and a justice of the peace, and his mother was a member of the prominent Conway family of Virginia. Madison's early education took place at home, where he was taught by his mother and private tutors. He later attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he graduated in 1771 with a degree in philosophy.\n\nDuring his time at college, Madison became interested in politics and was influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment. He was particularly drawn to the writings of John Locke, who emphasized the importance of individual rights and liberties. After graduating from college, Madison returned to Virginia and began to study law under the tutelage of Thomas Jefferson.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n\nMadison's involvement in politics began during the American Revolution. In 1774, he attended the First Continental Congress, where he met with other colonial leaders to discuss the growing tensions with Great Britain. Madison played a key role in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and was a strong supporter of the colonies' right to self-government.\n\nIn 1780, Madison was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served for several years. During this time, he was a strong advocate for the rights of the common man and was critical of the wealthy elite. Madison also played a key role in the drafting of the Articles of Confederation, which were adopted by the Continental Congress in 1781.\n\nHowever, Madison soon became frustrated with the weaknesses of the Articles, which he believed failed to adequately address the needs of the states. He argued that a stronger central government was necessary to ensure the stability and prosperity of the nation.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n\nIn 1787, Madison was appointed to the Constitutional Convention, where he played a leading role in the drafting of the United States Constitution. Madison's proposal for a strong central government was met with resistance from some of the other delegates, who were concerned about states' rights and individual liberties. However, Madison was able to persuade his fellow delegates to compromise on several key issues, including the creation of a bicameral legislature and the establishment of a system of checks and balances.\n\nThe Constitution was ratified in 1788, and Madison was a key figure in the campaign to secure ratification in Virginia. He wrote several essays and articles in support of the Constitution, including the influential \"Federalist No. 10,\" which argued that a strong central government was necessary to prevent the rise of factionalism and promote the common good.\n\n**Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)**\n\n### Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served for several years. During this time, he played a key role in the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party, which was opposed to the Federalist Party led by Alexander Hamilton.\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for the rights of the common man and was critical of the wealthy elite. He argued that the government should be more accountable to the people and that the power of the executive branch should be limited.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1789, Madison was tasked with drafting the Bill of Rights, which were designed to protect the individual liberties and rights of Americans. Madison's proposal included several key amendments, including the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to a fair trial.\n\nThe Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791, and Madison was widely praised for his role in its creation.\n\n### Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn the 1790s, Madison played a key role in the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party, which was opposed to the Federalist Party led by Alexander Hamilton. Madison was a strong advocate for the rights of the common man and was critical of the wealthy elite.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party was committed to limited government and the principles of individual liberty. Madison was a key figure in the party and played a leading role in its campaigns.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, the widow of a young army officer. The couple had no children together, but Madison adopted Dolley's son from her previous marriage.\n\n### Adams presidency\n\nIn 1796, Madison was a key supporter of Thomas Jefferson's presidential campaign against John Adams. However, Madison's relationship with Jefferson was strained, and he eventually became disillusioned with Jefferson's presidency.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n\n### 1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison's lifelong friend and ally, James Monroe, announced his candidacy for president. However, Madison's own aspirations for the presidency were still alive, and he began to secretly plan his own campaign.\n\nMadison's supporters argued that he was the strongest candidate for the nomination, citing his experience as a congressman and his role in the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\nMadison was eventually nominated by the party, and he went on to defeat Monroe in the election. Madison's victory was seen as a significant upset, as many had expected Monroe to win.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n\n### Inauguration and cabinet\n\nIn 1809, Madison was inaugurated as the fourth President of the United States. Madison's cabinet included several notable figures, including James Monroe, William Eustis, and Robert Smith.\n\nMadison's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the War of 1812 and the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\n### War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to war\n\nThe War of 1812 was fought between the United States and Great Britain, and was sparked by several factors, including the British practice of impressment and the British support of Native American resistance against American expansion.\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of the war, arguing that it was necessary to defend the nation's sovereignty and protect its citizens.\n\n#### Military actions\n\nThe war was fought on several fronts, including land and sea battles in the North and South. Madison's military leaders, including General William Hull and General Andrew Jackson, played key roles in several important battles.\n\nOne of the most significant battles of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, which took place in 1815. The battle was won by American forces, and marked a significant turning point in the war.\n\n#### Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nAfter the war, Madison's popularity declined, and the Federalist Party began to regain strength. Madison's opponents argued that he had not done enough to support the war effort and that he had been slow to respond to British aggression.\n\nHowever, Madison's supporters argued that he had done everything in his power to support the war and that he had made difficult decisions in the face of uncertain circumstances.\n\n### Native American policy\n\nDuring his presidency, Madison's administration implemented several policies aimed at addressing the needs of Native Americans. One of the most significant of these policies was the Indian Removal Act, which was designed to relocate Native American tribes to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).\n\nMadison's administration also supported the development of Indian schools and the establishment of reservations.\n\n### Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the election of 1816. Madison's opponents, including the Federalist Party, argued that he was not eligible for re-election due to his age and health.\n\nHowever, Madison's supporters argued that he was still a strong leader and that he had done everything in his power to support the country.\n\nMadison was re-elected in 1816, and his presidency continued until 1817.\n\n**Post-presidency (1817–1836)**\n\n### Death\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried in Montpelier, Virginia, alongside his wife, Dolley.\n\n**Political and religious views**\n\nMadison was a strong advocate for the principles of individual liberty and limited government. He believed in the importance of the separation of powers and the rule of law.\n\nMadison was also a strong supporter of the Christian faith and was a member of the Episcopal Church.\n\n### Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong critic of the Federalist Party, which he believed was too centralized and too supportive of the wealthy elite. He argued that the government should be more accountable to the people and that the power of the executive branch should be limited.\n\n### Religion\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of the Christian faith and was a member of the Episcopal Church. He believed in the importance of prayer and the Bible in everyday life.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nMadison was a slave owner and believed in the institution of slavery. However, he also believed that slavery was morally wrong and that it was a contradiction to the principles of liberty and equality.\n\nMadison's views on slavery were complex and nuanced, and he believed that it was a difficult issue that required careful consideration.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in American history, and his contributions to the country's development are still felt today.\n\nMadison's commitment to individual liberty and limited government has had a lasting impact on American politics, and his role in the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party helped to shape the country's political landscape.\n\nMadison's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the War of 1812 and the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nOverall, Madison's legacy is one of dedication to the principles of individual liberty and limited government, and his contributions to American history continue to be felt today.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive biography of James Madison, the fourth President of the United States.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as they are not necessary for a comprehensive biography.\n\n**Further reading**\n\nFor further information on James Madison, please see the following sources:\n\n* Madison, James.

Born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, Webern's life was marked by periods of creative flourishing and personal turmoil, ultimately culminating in his tragic death during World War II.\n\n**Biography**\n\n### 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\nWebern's early life was shaped by his family's social status and their connections to the Viennese musical scene. His father, Carl Eberwein, was a civil servant, and the family resided in a modest home in the 9th district of Vienna.\n\n#### Bucolic Heimat\n\nThe Webern family spent their summers in the countryside, where Anton developed a deep appreciation for nature and the simple life. This idyllic setting would later influence his compositions, which often feature elements of folk music and a strong connection to the natural world.\n\n#### University\n\nWebern studied law at the University of Vienna, but his true passion lay in music. He attended concerts and performances, where he met prominent composers and musicians, including Arnold Schoenberg. This exposure had a profound impact on Webern's musical development and would shape his artistic vision for years to come.\n\n#### Schoenberg and his circle\n\nWebern's friendship with Schoenberg and his circle of avant-garde composers marked the beginning of his involvement with the Second Viennese School. This group, which included Alban Berg and Erwin Stein, would become a driving force in the development of atonal music and twelve-tone technique.\n\n### 1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n\nWebern's marriage to Wilhelmine Mörtl in 1908 marked a significant turning point in his life. The couple moved to Vienna, where Webern began to establish himself as a conductor and composer.\n\n#### Marriage\n\nWebern's relationship with his wife, Wilhelmine, was marked by mutual support and encouragement. She was a frequent collaborator, often participating in his compositions and providing valuable feedback.\n\n#### Early conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career began in the early 1910s, with appearances in Vienna and other Austrian cities. His performances of contemporary works helped to establish him as a prominent figure in the avant-garde music scene.\n\n#### Psychotherapy\n\nWebern underwent psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud, which had a profound impact on his artistic development. This experience would later influence his compositions, which often explored themes of identity and the human psyche.\n\n#### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nWebern's early compositions, such as his String Quartets, Op. 7, reveal a strong sense of longing and nostalgia. This \"old song\" of a \"lost paradise\" would become a recurring theme throughout his career, as he sought to capture the essence of a bygone era.\n\n#### World War I\n\nWebern's experiences during World War I had a profound impact on his life and art. The trauma and devastation he witnessed during this period would later influence his compositions, which often featured elements of darkness and despair.\n\n#### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nAustria's defeat in World War I led to significant socioeconomic strain, which affected Webern's life and art. He struggled to make ends meet, often relying on the support of friends and family to survive.\n\n### 1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n\nWebern's rise to prominence in the interwar period was marked by his involvement with the Society for Private Musical Performances. This organization, which aimed to promote new music, provided a platform for Webern's compositions and helped to establish him as a leading figure in the avant-garde music scene.\n\n#### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nThe Society for Private Musical Performances was a key institution in the development of modern classical music. Founded in 1918, the organization provided a platform for composers to showcase their works and helped to establish a sense of community among avant-garde musicians.\n\n#### Mature conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career continued to flourish in the interwar period, with appearances in Vienna and other European cities. His performances of contemporary works helped to establish him as a leading figure in the avant-garde music scene.\n\n#### Relative success in a destabilizing society\n\nWebern's success during this period was relative, as the interwar period was marked by significant social and economic upheaval. Despite these challenges, he continued to create innovative and influential music, which would go on to shape the course of modern classical music.\n\n### 1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n\nWebern's life during the Austrofascist period was marked by significant challenges and marginalization.

The song was released in 1985 on Bush's album Hounds of Love.\n\n## Music and Lyrics\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" is a song with a moderate tempo, featuring a mix of rock and pop elements. The lyrics, written by Kate Bush, are a metaphorical exploration of the idea of trading places with someone else to understand their perspective. The song's title is a reference to a phrase used in the sport of running, where participants run up a steep hill to simulate the demands of competition.\n\n## Recording\n\nThe recording of \"Running Up That Hill\" was a complex process, with Bush experimenting with various sounds and techniques. The song features a distinctive synthesizer riff, created using a Fairlight CMI, a digital sampler that was a state-of-the-art instrument at the time. The Fairlight CMI was used to create a wide range of sounds, from simple tones to complex textures.\n\n## Music Video\n\nThe music video for \"Running Up That Hill\" was directed by Tim Pope and features Kate Bush in a series of surreal and dreamlike sequences. The video shows Bush running through a series of landscapes, including a desert and a forest, before arriving at a final destination where she meets a mysterious figure. The video was a critical success and is often cited as one of the best music videos of all time.\n\n## Release\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" was released in June 1985 as a single from Kate Bush's album Hounds of Love.

The remix was a critical success and helped to introduce the song to a new generation of fans.\n\n## 2022 Revival and Stranger Things\n\nIn 2022, \"Running Up That Hill\" experienced a major revival in popularity, thanks in part to its inclusion in the fourth season of the Netflix series Stranger Things. The song was featured in a key scene in the show, where the character Max Mayfield (played by Sadie Sink) listens to the song on her Walkman as she navigates a difficult situation. The scene was a critical success and helped to introduce the song to a new generation of fans.\n\n## Critical Response\n\n\"Running Up That Hill\" has received widespread critical acclaim over the years.

Shetty also wanted to create a film that would showcase the talent of his lead actors, particularly Varun Dhawan, who was seen as a rising star at the time.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe casting process for the film was a long and arduous one, with Shetty holding auditions for several months before finalizing the cast. Varun Dhawan was the first actor to be cast in the film, followed by Kriti Sanon, who was signed on to play the role of Bindu. Rana Daggubati was also cast in the film, and was seen as a key player in the romantic subplot of the story.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe film was shot over a period of several months, with the majority of the filming taking place in the city of Mumbai. Shetty has stated that he chose to shoot on location in Mumbai because of the city's vibrant and colorful atmosphere, which he felt would add to the film's comedic tone. The film's budget was reportedly around Rs. 50 crores, which is a significant amount for a comedy film.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nThe post-production process for the film was a lengthy one, with Shetty working closely with his editors and visual effects team to create a cohesive and polished final product.

In reality, Sravani is a mortal woman who has been chosen by the temple to fulfill an ancient prophecy. The prophecy states that a chosen one will be born every 800 years to wield the power of the temple and defeat the forces of evil. Vatsal is initially skeptical but soon finds himself drawn into the temple's world, where he must confront his own demons and make a choice between his mundane life and a life of adventure.\n\nThe film's plot is a mix of action, drama, and fantasy, with a dash of humor. As Vatsal navigates the temple's secrets, he encounters a range of characters, including a wise old sage, a mischievous goddess, and a group of powerful warriors.

The Trump campaign and its allies pursued various avenues to challenge the election results, including lawsuits, public statements, and pressure on state and local officials.\n\n### January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n\nThe January 6, 2021 storming of the United States Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters marked a pivotal moment in the investigation into election obstruction. The attack, which resulted in five deaths and numerous injuries, was widely condemned as an insurrection. The incident led to a flurry of investigations and inquiries into the events surrounding the attack, including the roles of Trump and his allies in inciting the violence.\n\n**Original Indictment and Arraignment**\n\nOn August 1, 2023, a grand jury returned an indictment against Donald Trump, charging him with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. Trump was arraigned on the charges on August 3, 2023, and entered a not guilty plea.\n\n**Superseding Indictment and Arraignment**\n\nOn September 15, 2023, the prosecution filed a superseding indictment, adding additional charges related to the alleged conspiracy. Trump was arraigned on the superseding indictment on September 18, 2023.\n\n**Statements in the Indictment**\n\n### Allegations and statements\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a comprehensive effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The allegations include claims that Trump and his allies made false and misleading statements about the election, pressured state and local officials to alter the outcome, and incited violence against those who opposed their efforts.\n\n### Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n\nThe first count of the indictment charges Trump and his co-conspirators with conspiracy to defraud the United States. The allegations include claims that the defendants engaged in a scheme to undermine the integrity of the electoral process and to defeat the will of the American people.\n\n### Further allegations and statements\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a wide range of conduct in support of their conspiracy, including the dissemination of false and misleading information, the intimidation of election officials, and the incitement of violence against those who opposed their efforts.\n\n### Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n\nThe second count of the indictment charges Trump and his co-conspirators with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. The allegations include claims that the defendants engaged in a scheme to interfere with the certification of the electoral results and to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n### Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n\nThe third count of the indictment charges Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding. The allegations include claims that Trump engaged in a scheme to intimidate and pressure state and local officials to alter the outcome of the election.\n\n### Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n\nThe fourth count of the indictment charges Trump and his co-conspirators with conspiracy against rights. The allegations include claims that the defendants engaged in a scheme to deny the rights of American citizens, including the right to free and fair elections.\n\n**Co-conspirators**\n\nThe indictment names several co-conspirators, including former Trump advisors and allies, as well as state and local officials who allegedly participated in the conspiracy. The co-conspirators are accused of engaging in a wide range of conduct in support of the conspiracy, including the dissemination of false and misleading information, the intimidation of election officials, and the incitement of violence against those who opposed their efforts.\n\n**Pretrial Proceedings**\n\n### Initial timetable\n\nThe trial is expected to begin in early 2024. However, the exact date has not yet been set.\n\n### Protective orders and security measures\n\nThe court has issued a series of protective orders and security measures to protect the safety and security of the parties involved in the trial. The orders include restrictions on the use of electronic devices and the presence of observers in the courtroom.\n\n### Other pre-trial motions\n\nThe parties have filed a series of pre-trial motions, including motions to exclude certain evidence and to limit the testimony of certain witnesses. The court is expected to rule on these motions in the coming weeks.\n\n### Immunity dispute\n\nThe prosecution and the defense have engaged in a dispute over the issue of immunity. The defense has argued that certain witnesses should be granted immunity in exchange for their testimony, while the prosecution has argued that immunity is not necessary. The court is expected to rule on this issue in the coming weeks.\n\n#### Appeals\n\nThe parties have filed a series of appeals related to the immunity dispute. The appeals are expected to be heard by the appellate court in the coming months.\n\n#### Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n\nThe court is expected to rule on the immunity dispute in the coming weeks. The ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the trial and the outcome of the case.\n\n### Post-immunity timetable\n\nOnce the immunity issue has been resolved, the parties are expected to proceed with the trial. The exact date and details of the trial are expected to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n**Potential Witnesses and Evidence**\n\n### Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution is expected to call a wide range of witnesses, including election officials, lawyers, and experts. The prosecution is also expected to present a significant amount of evidence, including documents, recordings, and testimony.\n\n### Defense\n\nThe defense is expected to call a limited number of witnesses and present a limited amount of evidence. The defense is expected to argue that the prosecution's case is based on flawed assumptions and that the evidence presented is insufficient to support the charges.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Defendant\n\nDonald Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has claimed that the charges against him are baseless and politically motivated. Trump has also attacked the prosecution and the investigation, labeling it a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax\".\n\n### Republicans in support of the indictment\n\nA number of Republicans have expressed support for the indictment and the investigation. These Republicans have argued that the charges against Trump are legitimate and that the investigation is necessary to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n### Republicans opposed to the indictment\n\nA number of Republicans have expressed opposition to the indictment and the investigation. These Republicans have argued that the charges against Trump are baseless and that the investigation is a partisan attack on the president.\n\n### Democrats in support of the indictment\n\nA number of Democrats have expressed support for the indictment and the investigation. These Democrats have argued that the charges against Trump are legitimate and that the investigation is necessary to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n##January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n#Original indictment and arraignment\n#Superseding indictment and arraignment\n#Statements in the indictment\n##Allegations and statements\n##Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n##Further allegations and statements\n##Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n##Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n##Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n#Co-conspirators\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##Initial timetable\n##Protective orders and security measures\n##Other pre-trial motions\n##Immunity dispute\n###Appeals\n###Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n##Post-immunity timetable\n#Potential witnesses and evidence\n##Prosecution\n##Defense\n#Reactions\n##Defendant\n##Republicans in support of the indictment\n##Republicans opposed to the indictment\n##Democrats in support of the indictment\n#See also\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Abby Quinn, and Rupert Grint.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows a group of friends, including Redmond (Jonathan Groff), his partner Andrew (Ben Aldridge), and his sister and brother-in-law, Barb (Nikki Amuka-Bird) and Armand (Abby Quinn). They embark on a family vacation in a remote cabin in the woods. However, their peaceful getaway is disrupted when a mysterious stranger, Leonard (Dave Bautista), arrives at the cabin with a cryptic warning that the world will end in seven days unless they find a way to stop it.\n\nAs the group tries to decipher Leonard's message, they realize that he is not what he seems. Leonard is a devout follower of an apocalyptic cult, and his warning is actually a test to see if the group is worthy of being saved. As the deadline approaches, the group is forced to make impossible decisions and confront their own personal demons in order to survive.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Dave Bautista as Leonard\n* Jonathan Groff as Redmond\n* Ben Aldridge as Andrew\n* Nikki Amuka-Bird as Barb\n* Abby Quinn as Armand\n* Rupert Grint as Eric\n* Scott Haze as Chris\n* Kuhoo Verma as Zohra\n\n**Production**\n\n#### Development\n\nKnock at the Cabin was developed by M.

The film's production team built a large set in the woods, which included a cabin and several other structures. The cast and crew spent several weeks filming on location, with the film's director, M. Night Shyamalan, stating that the remote location added to the film's sense of isolation and tension.\n\n**Release**\n\nKnock at the Cabin was released in theaters on February 3, 2023, by Universal Pictures. The film was released in a limited capacity, with many theaters offering special preview screenings before its wide release. The film's marketing campaign included a series of promotional posters and trailers, which highlighted the film's unique blend of horror and drama.\n\n#### Home media\n\nKnock at the Cabin was released on digital platforms on March 21, 2023, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 18, 2023.

The monument features a set of ten guidelines inscribed in eight languages, which have been the subject of various interpretations and conspiracy theories.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were commissioned by a person or group known only as \"R.C. Christian,\" who wished to remain anonymous. The monument was designed by architect Robert C. Davis and constructed by Elberton Granite Finishing Company. The stones were dedicated on March 22, 1980, and have since become a popular tourist attraction.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Construction\n\nThe construction of the Georgia Guidestones began in 1979 and took approximately a year to complete. The stones were quarried from a nearby granite quarry and transported to the site, where they were cut and fitted together to form a large monument. The stones are made of Georgia pink granite, a type of granite known for its distinctive pinkish color.\n\nThe monument is composed of four large stones, each weighing approximately 19 tons, and four smaller stones, each weighing approximately 3.6 tons. The stones are arranged in a circular pattern, with the four large stones forming the perimeter of the circle and the four smaller stones positioned at the center.\n\n#### Reaction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were met with a mixed reaction from the local community and the general public. Some people saw the monument as a symbol of wisdom and guidance, while others viewed it as a strange and mysterious structure.\n\nThe monument was also the subject of controversy, with some people questioning the motivations of the person or group who commissioned it. The monument's guidelines, which are inscribed on the stones, were seen by some as a call to action for a new world order.\n\n#### Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were severely damaged in an explosion, which caused significant damage to the monument. The explosion was reported to have been caused by a pipe bomb, and it is believed to have been a deliberate act of vandalism.\n\nThe destruction of the Georgia Guidestones was met with widespread shock and outrage, and it sparked a renewed debate about the monument's significance and meaning.\n\n#### Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the Georgia Guidestones has sparked a renewed interest in the monument and its guidelines. The incident has also raised questions about the monument's future and whether it will be rebuilt or replaced.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for greater security measures to protect the monument and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n**Description**\n\n#### Inscriptions\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are the most distinctive feature of the monument. The guidelines are inscribed in eight languages, including English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.\n\nThe guidelines are as follows:\n\n1. \"Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\"\n2. \"Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.\"\n3. \"Unite humanity with a living new language.\"\n4. \"Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.\"\n5. \"Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\"\n6. \"Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\"\n7. \"Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\"\n8. \"Balance personal rights with social duties.\"\n9. \" Prize truth - beauty - love - seeking harmony with the infinite.\"\n10. \"Be not a cancer on the earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature.\"\n\n#### Explanatory tablet\n\nThe explanatory tablet is a small stone positioned at the center of the monument, which provides a brief explanation of the guidelines and the monument's purpose.\n\nThe tablet reads:\n\n\"Let these be guideposts to an age of reason. Balance personal rights with social duties. Treat all with dignity and respect.\"\n\n#### Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are 19.5 feet tall, 16.5 feet wide, and 3.5 feet thick. The monument weighs approximately 119 tons and is made of Georgia pink granite.\n\n#### Guidestone languages\n\nThe guidelines are inscribed in eight languages, including:\n\n* English\n* Spanish\n* Swahili\n* Hindi\n* Hebrew\n* Arabic\n* Chinese\n* Russian\n\n#### Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature a series of astronomical alignments, including a solar alignment that occurs on March 20th and a lunar alignment that occurs on March 21st.\n\n**Interpretations**\n\n#### Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of various conspiracy theories, including claims that the monument is a call to action for a new world order and that it is connected to secret societies and other groups.\n\nSome people believe that the guidelines are a blueprint for a one-world government, while others believe that they are a warning about the dangers of overpopulation and environmental degradation.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Monument\n* Conspiracy theory\n* New world order\n* One-world government\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Guide to Reason\" by R.C.

It is a fundamental component of the Earth's physical environment, playing a crucial role in shaping the planet's climate, geography, and ecosystems.\n\n**Definition**\n\nLand can be defined as the solid portion of the Earth's surface, excluding the atmosphere and hydrosphere. It is the foundation upon which all life on Earth is supported, providing the necessary conditions for the growth of plants, the habitation of animals, and the development of human societies.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"land\" is derived from the Old English word \"land,\" which is also the source of the Modern English word. In Old English, \"land\" referred to the territory or country of a specific people or nation. Over time, the term broadened to encompass the physical surface of the Earth, including the landmasses and territories.\n\n**Physical Science**\n\n### Formation\n\nThe formation of land is a complex process that involves the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, and erosion. The Earth's crust is broken up into several large plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. As these plates move, they interact with each other, resulting in the creation of mountains, volcanoes, and other geological features.\n\n### Landmasses\n\nThe Earth's landmasses are the largest pieces of land on the planet.

From its early beginnings to the present day, the telephone has played a crucial role in shaping the country's communication landscape. This article will explore the major developments and milestones in the history of the telephone in the United States.\n\n**#AT&T and the Bell System**\n\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and the Bell System were instrumental in the development and growth of the telephone industry in the United States. Here is a brief overview of the key periods in AT&T's history.\n\n### **##American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)**\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was founded in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. The company's primary focus was on developing and marketing the telephone, with a goal of creating a network of telephones across the United States. In 1885, American Bell was granted a 14-year patent for the telephone, which gave the company a monopoly on the industry.\n\n### **##AT&T (1899–1982)**\n\nIn 1899, AT&T was formed through the merger of American Bell and several other telephone companies. The company's primary goal was to create a nationwide telephone network, which would connect cities and towns across the United States. Under the leadership of Theodore Vail, AT&T's president from 1907 to 1919, the company made significant strides in expanding its network and introducing new technologies.\n\n### **##Research priority**\n\nOne of AT&T's key priorities was research and development. The company invested heavily in research facilities and laboratories, where scientists and engineers worked on developing new technologies and improving existing ones. This focus on research led to numerous innovations, including the introduction of touch-tone phones and the development of long-distance communication systems.\n\n### **##Targeting an audience**\n\nAs the telephone industry grew, AT&T and other telephone companies focused on targeting specific audiences. Here are some examples:\n\n#### **####Urban public telephones**\n\nIn urban areas, telephone companies installed public telephones, which allowed people to make calls from a central location. These phones were often located in public spaces, such as post offices, train stations, and department stores.\n\n#### **####Rural telephone service**\n\nIn rural areas, telephone companies faced significant challenges in providing service. Many rural areas lacked access to electricity, and the terrain made it difficult to install phone lines. To address these challenges, telephone companies used innovative technologies, such as pole lines and party lines, to provide service to rural areas.\n\n### **##Breakup of AT&T in 1982**\n\nIn 1982, the U.S. Department of Justice sued AT&T, alleging that the company had monopolized the telephone industry. As a result of the suit, AT&T was broken up into seven regional Bell operating companies, each of which became a separate company. This breakup marked a significant change in the telephone industry, as it led to increased competition and innovation.\n\n**#Cellphones and smartphones**\n\nThe introduction of cellphones and smartphones revolutionized the telephone industry. These devices allowed people to make calls and send messages from anywhere, at any time. Here are some key developments in the history of cellphones and smartphones:\n\n*   The first cellphone was introduced in 1973 by Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola. The device weighed over 2 pounds and had a talk time of around 30 minutes.\n*   In the 1990s, cellphones became more widespread, with companies like AT&T and Verizon offering service.\n*   The introduction of smartphones in the 2000s marked a significant shift in the industry. These devices combined the functionality of cellphones with the features of computers, allowing people to access the internet, send emails, and use apps.\n\n**#Personnel**\n\nThe telephone industry employed a large workforce, with switchboard operators, telephone engineers, and other personnel playing critical roles. Here are some key facts about personnel in the telephone industry:\n\n### **##Switchboard and operators**\n\nSwitchboard operators were responsible for connecting calls between different locations. They used switchboards, which were large panels of buttons and levers, to connect calls. Operators were trained to handle a high volume of calls, and they played a critical role in the telephone industry.\n\n### **##Labor force: bias for and against women**\n\nThe telephone industry had a large female workforce, particularly in switchboard and operator roles. However, women faced significant challenges in the industry, including low wages and limited career advancement opportunities.\n\n### **##Strikes**\n\nTelephone workers went on strike several times throughout the history of the industry, including a major strike in 1946. The strike, which lasted for 114 days, was called by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and resulted in significant gains for workers, including higher wages and improved working conditions.\n\n### **##Hawthorne studies**\n\nThe Hawthorne studies were a series of experiments conducted by Western Electric in the 1920s and 1930s. The studies, which were designed to improve working conditions and productivity, had a significant impact on the telephone industry. The findings of the studies, which included the discovery of the \"Hawthorne effect,\" are still studied today.\n\n### **##Employee benefits**\n\nTelephone companies offered a range of employee benefits, including health insurance, pension plans, and training programs. These benefits were an important part of the industry's compensation package and helped to attract and retain top talent.\n\n**#Users**\n\nThe telephone was used by a wide range of people, including business professionals, housewives, and individuals from all walks of life. Here are some key facts about users of the telephone:\n\n### **##Business**\n\nBusinesses used the telephone for a variety of purposes, including making sales calls, communicating with customers, and coordinating with suppliers. The telephone was a critical tool for businesses, and it played a key role in the growth and development of the economy.\n\n### **##Housewives**\n\nHousewives used the telephone for a variety of purposes, including making social calls, communicating with family members, and ordering groceries. The telephone was an important tool for housewives, and it helped to connect them with the outside world.\n\n### **##Gender and culture roles**\n\nThe telephone played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles in the United States. Women, who were often confined to the home, used the telephone to connect with the outside world and to assert their independence. The telephone also played a role in shaping cultural norms and values, particularly around issues of communication and relationships.\n\n### **##Telemarketing**\n\nTelemarketing was a significant industry that emerged in the mid-20th century. Telemarketers used the telephone to sell products and services to customers, often using high-pressure sales tactics. The industry was criticized for its aggressive tactics and lack of transparency.\n\n### **##9-1-1**\n\nThe 9-1-1 system was introduced in the 1960s as a way to quickly connect emergency services with callers in need. The system was a significant improvement over previous emergency response systems and has saved countless lives.\n\n### **##Harassing calls**\n\nHarassing calls were a significant problem in the telephone industry. Harassers used the telephone to make threatening or unwanted calls to individuals, often with the intention of causing harm or distress. The industry responded to this problem by implementing new technologies and laws to prevent harassing calls.\n\n### **##Literary fears**\n\nThe telephone was also a source of fear and anxiety in literature and popular culture. Authors like H.G. Wells and Aldous Huxley wrote about the dangers of the telephone and its impact on society. These fears were often rooted in concerns about the loss of privacy and the blurring of boundaries between public and private spaces.\n\n**#See also**\n\n*   History of telecommunications\n*   History of telephones\n*   Telephone technology\n*   Telephone industry\n*   Switchboard\n*   Operator\n*   9-1-1 system\n*   Harassing calls\n*   Literary fears\n\n**#References**\n\n*   AT&T Archives\n*   Bell Labs Archives\n*   Communications Workers of America\n*   National Archives and Records Administration\n*   Smithsonian Institution\n*   Telephone History\n*   Western Electric Archives\n\n**#Further reading**\n\n*   **Social and cultural studies:**\n    *   \"The Telephone and Modern Society\" by Claude Fischer\n    *   \"The Social History of the Telephone\" by Gerard P.

Born on September 9, 1964, in Tembhurni, a small village in the Palghar district of Maharashtra, Shinde hails from a family of farmers. He is currently the leader of the Shiv Sena party, a regional party in Maharashtra.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEknath Shinde was born to Sambhaji Shinde, a farmer, and Savitri Shinde. He was the eldest among eight siblings. Shinde grew up in a traditional Marathi-speaking family, where his parents were deeply involved in local politics. His father, Sambhaji Shinde, was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from 1985 to 1990. Shinde completed his schooling in Tembhurni and later pursued a degree in commerce from the University of Mumbai.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\n### **Entry into Politics**\n\nShinde's entry into politics began with his involvement in local politics in Tembhurni. At the age of 22, he joined the Shiv Sena, a regional political party in Maharashtra, founded by Bal Thackeray. Shinde's entry into the party was facilitated by his father, who was a close associate of Thackeray. Shinde quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the president of the Shiv Sena youth wing in the Palghar district.\n\n### **Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & Ministries**\n\nShinde made his debut in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly in 2000, winning the Palghar constituency by a significant margin. Since then, he has retained the seat in four consecutive elections. Shinde has held various portfolios in the Maharashtra government, including Minister of State for Home, Minister of State for Revenue, and Minister of State for Urban Development. His tenure as a minister saw significant development in the Palghar district, including the construction of roads, hospitals, and schools.\n\n**Role in 2022 Maharashtra Political Crisis**\n\nIn June 2022, a major crisis emerged in the Shiv Sena, with several MLAs, including Shinde, rebelling against the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray. The rebellion was sparked by a series of disagreements over power and policy within the party. Shinde, along with other MLAs, formed a breakaway faction of the Shiv Sena, which later merged with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The crisis led to a change in the government of Maharashtra, with Shinde becoming the new leader of the Shiv Sena and eventually the Chief Minister of Maharashtra.\n\n**Chief Minister**\n\n### **Electoral Performance**\n\nAs Chief Minister, Shinde led the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance to a decisive victory in the 2022 Maharashtra state assembly elections. The alliance won 174 seats, a significant majority in the 288-seat assembly. Shinde's leadership played a crucial role in the election campaign, which focused on issues such as development, agriculture, and infrastructure.\n\n**Leader of Shiv Sena**\n\n### **Shiv Sena Leadership Dispute**\n\nThe leadership dispute within the Shiv Sena, which led to Shinde's rebellion, remains a contentious issue. Shinde's faction of the party, which merged with the BJP, has been recognized as the legitimate leadership of the Shiv Sena. However, the Thackeray faction, which was loyal to Uddhav Thackeray, has refused to accept Shinde's leadership, claiming that it is illegitimate. The dispute has led to a split in the party, with both factions claiming to be the true representatives of the Shiv Sena.\n\n### **Political Legitimacy**\n\nShinde's legitimacy as the leader of the Shiv Sena has been questioned by several senior leaders within the party. Some have argued that his rebellion against Uddhav Thackeray was a betrayal of the party's principles and that he has no right to claim leadership. However, Shinde has maintained that he has the support of the majority of the party's MLAs and that he is the rightful leader of the Shiv Sena.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, a school teacher, and has two children, a son, and a daughter. He is known for his simple and humble lifestyle, which has earned him a reputation as a down-to-earth leader. Shinde is also known for his love of music and is a skilled singer.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nShinde has been the subject of several news articles and interviews, which have highlighted his leadership style and his vision for the Shiv Sena. He has also been featured in several TV shows and documentaries, which have explored his rise to power and his tenure as Chief Minister.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season began on August 27, 2022, and ended with the College Football Playoff National Championship on January 9, 2023.\n\nRule changes\n\nSeveral rule changes were implemented for the 2022 season, including a new rule that prohibits defensive players from initiating contact with a ball carrier from the side or behind. This rule was designed to reduce the number of injuries to players and to improve player safety. Additionally, the NCAA implemented a rule that requires teams to have at least one player on the field who is a defensive back or a linebacker when the ball is snapped. This rule was intended to prevent teams from using all linemen on the field and to promote a more balanced defense.\n\nOther headlines\n\nThe 2022 season was marked by several notable headlines, including the realignment of several conferences and the opening of new stadiums. The Big 12 Conference expanded to 14 teams with the addition of BYU, Cincinnati, Houston, and UCF, while the Mountain West Conference added New Mexico State and Sam Houston State.

It is situated at an altitude of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest towns in India. Darjeeling is famous for its tea plantations, scenic beauty, and as a major tourist destination.\n\n**Toponymy**\n\nThe name \"Darjeeling\" is derived from the Tibetan words \"Dorje\" meaning \"thunderbolt\" and \"Ling\" meaning \"place\". The town was named after the Dorje Ling Monastery, which was a major Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the area.\n\n**History**\n\n#### 1780 to 1835\n\nThe area that is now Darjeeling was inhabited by the Lepchas, a indigenous tribe, and the Bhutias, a Tibetan ethnic group. In 1780, the British East India Company sent a surveyor, Captain Archibald Campbell, to the area to explore its potential as a trading post. Campbell was impressed by the area's natural beauty and its potential for tea cultivation. However, it was not until the 1820s that the British began to establish tea plantations in the area.\n\n#### 1835–1857: East India Company rule\n\nIn 1835, the British East India Company established a tea estate in the area, which marked the beginning of tea cultivation in Darjeeling. The company built a road, a church, and other infrastructure to support the tea industry. During this period, the British also began to attract European settlers to the area, who came to work in the tea industry or start their own businesses.\n\n#### 1858–1947: British Raj\n\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British East India Company was dissolved, and the British Crown took direct control of India. Darjeeling became a major hill station, attracting British tourists and settlers who were seeking relief from the heat of the plains. During this period, the British built many of the town's modern infrastructure, including its railway, schools, and hospitals.\n\n#### 1947 onwards: independent India\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, Darjeeling became a part of the new nation. The town continued to grow as a tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Indian government began to promote tourism in Darjeeling, building new infrastructure and promoting the town's scenic beauty.\n\n**Geography and geology**\n\nDarjeeling is located in the Himalayan foothills, at an altitude of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) above sea level. The town is surrounded by mountains, with the highest peak, Kanchenjunga, located just 18 kilometers (11 miles) away. The town's terrain is varied, with steep hills, valleys, and rivers. The soil is fertile, making it suitable for tea cultivation.\n\n**Climate and environment**\n\n#### Climate\n\nDarjeeling has a subtropical climate, with mild winters and cool summers. The town experiences a distinct monsoon season, with heavy rainfall from June to September. The average temperature in winter is around 10°C (50°F), while in summer it is around 20°C (68°F).\n\n#### Environment\n\nDarjeeling is known for its scenic beauty, with lush green tea gardens, rolling hills, and misty mountains.
