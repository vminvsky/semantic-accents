These events have had significant political, logistical, and societal consequences, shaping the course of American history. This article provides an overview of the background, consequences, and lists of federal judges who have died in active service.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is composed of Article III judges, who serve for life terms, as well as Article IV judges, who serve for fixed terms. Article III judges include Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, and District Court judges. Article IV judges include bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges. The vast majority of federal judges serve in Article III courts, and their deaths in active service are the focus of this article.\n\nThe federal judiciary has a long history, dating back to the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the Supreme Court and the federal court system. Over time, the number of federal judges has increased, and the role of the judiciary has expanded. Despite the importance of the judiciary, the deaths of federal judges in active service have often been overshadowed by other events.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service have had significant political consequences. The most notable example is the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist in 2005, which led to the appointment of Justice John Roberts as Chief Justice. Rehnquist's death was a significant blow to the conservative movement, and his successor, Roberts, has continued to shape the Court's conservative agenda.\n\nThe death of Judge Robert Bork in 2012, a prominent conservative jurist, also had significant political consequences. Bork's death was seen as a loss for the conservative movement, and his legacy continues to shape American politics.\n\nFurthermore, the deaths of federal judges have also led to changes in the Court's composition and ideology. For example, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020 led to the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative jurist, which has shifted the Court's balance in favor of conservatives.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service have also had logistical consequences. The most significant example is the impact on the Court's workload and scheduling. When a judge dies, the Court must adjust its docket to accommodate the new vacancy. This can lead to delays in cases and changes in the Court's schedule.\n\nThe death of a judge can also lead to changes in the composition of the Court's circuit courts. When a judge dies, the President must nominate a replacement, and the Senate must confirm the nominee. This process can take several months, during which time the circuit court may be understaffed.\n\n**Lists**\n\n### 1789–1869\n\nThe following federal judges died in active service during this period:\n\n* William Cushing (Supreme Court) in 1810\n* William Paterson (Supreme Court) in 1806\n* James Wilson (Supreme Court) in 1798\n* James Iredell (Supreme Court) in 1799\n* James Wilson (District Court) in 1798\n* Thomas Johnson (District Court) in 1793\n* John Jay (Chief Justice) in 1829\n* James Kent (Chief Justice) in 1847\n\n### 1870–1919\n\nThe following federal judges died in active service during this period:\n\n* Morrison Waite (Chief Justice) in 1888\n* Stephen J.

The protests were marked by widespread discontent and frustration with the government's handling of the crisis, as well as demands for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and other government officials.\n\n**Background**\n\nSri Lanka was facing a severe economic crisis, with high levels of inflation, food and fuel shortages, and a sharp decline in living standards. The country's foreign exchange reserves had plummeted, and the government was struggling to import essential goods, including food, medicine, and fuel.

She was known for her reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was widely respected for her courage and professionalism in the face of danger.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on February 3, 1971, in Jerusalem, which was then under Israeli occupation. Her parents were both Palestinian, and she grew up in a family that valued education and journalism. Abu Akleh began her career in journalism at a young age, working for local Palestinian newspapers and television stations. She later moved to the United States, where she attended college and began working for Al Jazeera English.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nAbu Akleh was born to a family of Palestinian refugees who had fled to Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Her parents were both educated and encouraged their children to pursue careers in education and journalism. Abu Akleh's early education was at the Latin Patriarchate School in Jerusalem, where she developed a strong interest in writing and storytelling. She later attended Birzeit University in the West Bank, where she earned a degree in journalism and media studies.\n\n**Career**\n\nAbu Akleh began her career in journalism in the early 1990s, working for local Palestinian newspapers and television stations. She quickly gained a reputation for her in-depth reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was soon hired by Al Jazeera English to work as a correspondent in the Middle East. Abu Akleh reported on a wide range of topics, including the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the conflict in Syria, and the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. She was known for her bravery and willingness to take risks to get the story, often finding herself in difficult and dangerous situations.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Abu Akleh was shot and killed while reporting on an Israeli military operation in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. She was shot in the head and neck and died shortly after arrival at the hospital. The Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh was shot by Palestinian militants, but this claim was later disputed by eyewitnesses and evidence collected by Al Jazeera.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nFollowing Abu Akleh's death, there was an outpouring of grief and outrage from across the world. Her colleagues and friends remembered her as a courageous and dedicated journalist who had risked her life to tell the stories of those affected by conflict. Human rights groups and media organizations condemned her killing and called for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\n**Funeral**\n\nAbu Akleh's funeral was held on May 13, 2022, in Jerusalem, with thousands of mourners attending the ceremony. Her body was carried through the streets of Jerusalem, where she was remembered as a hero and a martyr for journalism. The funeral procession was marked by clashes between Palestinian mourners and Israeli police, who used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe reaction to Abu Akleh's death was swift and widespread. The Palestinian Authority condemned her killing and called for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death. The Israeli government initially claimed that Abu Akleh was shot by Palestinian militants, but later acknowledged that the Israeli military may have been responsible for her death. The international community was shocked and outraged by Abu Akleh's killing, with many calling for greater protections for journalists in conflict zones.\n\n**Investigations**\n\n**Initial Israel investigations**\n\nThe Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh was shot by Palestinian militants, but later acknowledged that the Israeli military may have been responsible for her death. An initial investigation by the Israeli military found that Abu Akleh was shot by a soldier who was not aware of her presence, but later investigations by the Israeli military and human rights groups raised questions about the accuracy of this account.\n\n**Subsequent investigations**\n\nA subsequent investigation by the Israeli military found that Abu Akleh was shot by an Israeli soldier, but the soldier's identity was not disclosed. Human rights groups and media organizations have called for a more thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances surrounding Abu Akleh's death.\n\n**Announcement of US investigation**\n\nIn June 2022, the US Department of State announced that it would be conducting an investigation into Abu Akleh's death. The investigation was led by a team of US officials who collected evidence and interviewed witnesses in the West Bank.\n\n**Referral of case to the International Criminal Court**\n\nIn July 2022, the Palestinian Authority referred the case of Abu Akleh's death to the International Criminal Court. The ICC has since launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.\n\n**Remembrance and legacy**\n\nAbu Akleh's legacy as a journalist and a champion of press freedom continues to be celebrated around the world. Her bravery and professionalism in the face of danger have inspired a new generation of journalists and human rights advocates. Her death was a tragic reminder of the risks faced by journalists in conflict zones, and the need for greater protections and support for those who risk their lives to tell the stories of those affected by conflict.\n\n**Honors and awards**\n\nAbu Akleh was widely recognized for her bravery and professionalism as a journalist. She received numerous awards and honors for her reporting, including the George Polk Award for International Reporting and the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award for Investigative Reporting.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Al Jazeera English\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Journalism in the Middle East\n* Press freedom\n* Human rights\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is based on a variety of sources, including news reports, interviews, and official documents.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as the information is based on publicly available sources.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Al Jazeera English\n* Palestinian Authority\n* Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* US Department of State\n* International Criminal Court", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shireen_Abu_Akleh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Death\n##Aftermath\n#Funeral\n#Reaction\n#Investigations\n##Initial Israel investigations\n##Subsequent investigations\n##Announcement of US investigation\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n#Remembrance and legacy\n#Honors and awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The project involves users creating a shared image on a 2D canvas, with each pixel being editable by anyone with an account on the platform. The project has gained significant attention and popularity within the online community, with many notable events and trends emerging during its iterations.\n\n**Overview**\n------------\n\nR/place is a user-driven project where individuals can contribute to a shared image by editing individual pixels. The project is operated by online platforms, with the most recent iteration being hosted on the social media website Reddit. The project's pixelated canvas is divided into a 1,001x1,001 grid, allowing users to create complex and detailed images.\n\n**History**\n-----------\n\n### 2017 Experiment\n\nThe first iteration of R/place took place in 2017, when Reddit introduced the project as an experiment in community-driven creativity. The project was hosted on the Reddit platform, with users able to edit individual pixels on a shared canvas. The project's rules were simple: users could select a pixel to edit, and then choose a color for that pixel from a palette of 16 colors. The project was met with significant interest, with users creating a wide range of images, including complex designs and humorous memes.\n\nDuring the 2017 experiment, users were able to edit pixels for 72 hours, with the project closing after that period. The resulting image was a complex and dynamic creation, with many different themes and designs emerging. The project was widely covered by online media outlets, with many praising the creativity and community spirit displayed by users.\n\n### 2022 Experiment\n\nThe second iteration of R/place took place in 2022, when Reddit launched the project once again as an experiment in community-driven creativity. The project retained the same basic rules as the 2017 iteration, with users able to edit individual pixels on a shared canvas. However, the project's palette was expanded to 24 colors, allowing for greater creative flexibility.\n\nThe 2022 experiment was notable for its more complex and detailed creations, with users producing intricate designs and patterns. The project also saw the emergence of several notable trends, including the creation of \"nations\" and \"flags\" by users. These trends showcased the project's ability to bring users together around shared interests and themes.\n\n### 2023 Experiment\n\nThe most recent iteration of R/place took place in 2023, when Reddit launched the project as part of a new series of community-driven experiments. The project retained the same basic rules as the previous iterations, with users able to edit individual pixels on a shared canvas. However, the project's palette was expanded to 32 colors, allowing for even greater creative flexibility.\n\nThe 2023 experiment was notable for its more diverse and global creations, with users producing a wide range of images and designs. The project also saw the emergence of several notable trends, including the creation of \"street art\" and \"urban landscapes\" by users. These trends showcased the project's ability to bring users together around shared interests and themes.\n\n**Media Response**\n-------------------\n\nR/place has received widespread media coverage during its iterations, with many outlets praising the project's creativity and community spirit. The project has been covered by online media outlets such as The Verge, Polygon, and Kotaku, as well as mainstream outlets such as The New York Times and BBC News.\n\nThe project's popularity has also led to several notable interviews and features, including a profile on NPR's \"Morning Edition\" and a feature on the cover of Wired magazine. The project's impact on the online community has been significant, with many users praising its ability to foster creativity and community engagement.\n\n**Atlas**\n--------\n\nR/place's Atlas is a comprehensive map of the project's history, showcasing the evolution of the project's image over time. The Atlas includes a detailed timeline of the project's iterations, as well as a visual representation of the project's most notable creations.\n\nThe Atlas is a valuable resource for users and researchers, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's history and evolution. It is available on the Reddit platform, where users can access it and explore the project's history in detail.\n\n**See Also**\n------------\n\n* Reddit\n* Community-driven creativity\n* Online art projects\n\n**External Links**\n------------------\n\n* Reddit's R/place page\n* Reddit's Community Guidelines\n* The Verge's coverage of R/place", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"R/place\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#History\n##2017 experiment\n##2022 experiment\n##2023 experiment\n#Media response\n#Atlas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The resolution is usually expressed as the number of pixels in the horizontal direction by the number of pixels in the vertical direction, such as 1920 x 1080. Display resolution standards have evolved significantly over the years, with various organizations and industries developing their own standards. This article provides an overview of the most common display resolution standards.\n\n**Overview**\n\nDisplay resolution standards have become increasingly important in recent years, as the demand for high-quality visual displays has grown. The resolution of a display device determines its ability to display clear and detailed images.

The locomotive is a Class J 4-8-4 Northern, a type of articulated steam locomotive designed for high-speed passenger service.\n\n# Design and abilities\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was designed by L. R. de Forest, the chief mechanical engineer of the N&W at the time, and built by the Roanoke Shops in Roanoke, Virginia. The locomotive features a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement, with two leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. This configuration allowed for improved traction and stability, making it well-suited for high-speed passenger service.\n\nThe 611 has a 75-inch driving wheel diameter, a boiler pressure of 300 pounds per square inch (psi), and a grate area of 74.5 square feet. Its firebox is equipped with an atomizing stoker, which helped to improve combustion efficiency and reduce smoke emissions. The locomotive's cab is located at the rear of the engine, with a crew of five: engineer, fireman, two brakemen, and a head brakeman.\n\nThe 611 was capable of reaching speeds of up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), making it one of the fastest steam locomotives in the United States at the time of its introduction. Its top speed was achieved on a test run in 1950, during which the locomotive reached 100 miles per hour on the N&W's Washington District.\n\n# History\n\n## Revenue service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 entered revenue service on August 26, 1950, on the N&W's Washington District, carrying passengers between Roanoke, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. The locomotive was initially assigned to the N&W's prestige passenger train, the Powhatan Arrow, which ran between Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nDuring its revenue service, the 611 hauled many notable passengers, including President Harry S. Truman and Governor of Virginia, John S. Battle. The locomotive's regular crew consisted of experienced engineers and firemen, who were known for their skill and attention to detail.\n\n## First retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from revenue service on September 25, 1959, after nearly nine years of operation. The locomotive was replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, which were deemed more efficient and cost-effective. The 611 was placed in storage at the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n## First mainline excursion service\n\nIn 1961, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition and began to haul excursion trains on the N&W's main line. The locomotive's first excursion run was on June 17, 1961, when it hauled a train of cars between Roanoke, Virginia, and Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nThe 611's excursion service was a huge success, with thousands of passengers traveling behind the historic locomotive. The excursion runs were typically 50-100 miles in length and featured a variety of cars, including observation cars, dining cars, and coaches.\n\n## Second retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from excursion service in 1975, due to a combination of factors, including the increasing cost of operating a steam locomotive and the availability of more modern diesel-electric locomotives. The locomotive was placed in storage at the N&W's Roanoke Shops, where it remained for several years.\n\n## Second mainline excursion service\n\nIn 1981, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operating condition and began to haul excursion trains on the N&W's main line once again. This time, the locomotive was operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS), which had acquired the N&W in 1982.\n\nThe 611's second excursion service was marked by a number of notable runs, including a trip to the 1983 NS Transportation Museum in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and a series of runs along the N&W's former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) line between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Huntington, West Virginia.\n\n## Post-NS excursion service\n\nIn 1994, the Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from excursion service for the final time, due to a combination of factors, including the increasing cost of operating a steam locomotive and the availability of more modern diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nToday, the Norfolk and Western 611 is on display at the NS Transportation Museum in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where it is maintained in operating condition and occasionally runs on special occasions. The locomotive is a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the engineers and craftsmen who built it, and a reminder of the importance of preserving our rail heritage.\n\n# Accidents and incidents\n\nDuring its revenue service, the Norfolk and Western 611 was involved in a number of minor accidents and incidents, including a collision with a freight train in 1954 and a derailment in 1957. However, the locomotive suffered no major damage in either incident and was able to continue operating without interruption.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been featured in a number of films and television shows, including the 1950s television series \"The Lone Ranger\" and the 1960s television series \"Route 66.\" The locomotive has also been the subject of several books and documentaries, including a 1960s book titled \"The Norfolk and Western 611\" and a 2000s documentary titled \"The Steam Locomotive: A History.\"\n\n# See also\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J 4-8-4 Northern\n* Steam locomotive\n* Railroad heritage\n* Transportation history\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the most iconic and historic locomotives in the United States.\n* The locomotive's design and construction were influenced by the work of L. R. de Forest, the chief mechanical engineer of the N&W at the time.\n* The 611's excursion service was a huge success, with thousands of passengers traveling behind the historic locomotive.\n* The locomotive's restoration and operation have been supported by a number of organizations, including the Norfolk Southern Railway and the National Railroad Museum.\n\n# References\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* \"The Norfolk and Western 611\" by Walter B.

The storm caused widespread damage and loss of life, particularly in the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\n**#Meteorological history**\n\nTyphoon Doksuri originated from a tropical disturbance that formed over the western Pacific Ocean on September 10, 2017. The system slowly intensified as it moved westward, eventually developing into a tropical depression on September 12. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on September 13, and was subsequently named Doksuri by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).\n\nDoksuri continued to intensify as it moved westward, eventually reaching typhoon strength on September 15. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 16, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 920 hPa. Doksuri then began to weaken as it interacted with the Asian landmass, eventually dissipating on September 20.\n\n**#Preparations**\n\n###Philippines\n\nThe Philippine government issued a signal number 2 in several provinces in the northern Philippines, including Cagayan and Isabela, on September 15. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) also issued a warning for possible landslides and flooding in the affected areas.\n\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also issued a public storm warning signal number 1 in several areas in the northern Philippines, including Metro Manila.\n\n###Taiwan\n\nThe Taiwanese government issued a land warning for southeastern Taiwan on September 16, as Doksuri was expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the area.\n\n###China\n\nThe Chinese government issued a yellow alert for strong winds and heavy rain in several provinces, including Fujian and Guangdong, on September 16.\n\n**#Impact**\n\n###Philippines\n\nWidespread flooding occurred in several provinces in the northern Philippines, including Cagayan and Isabela, due to heavy rainfall associated with Doksuri. The flooding caused significant damage to crops and infrastructure.\n\nThe MB Aya Express, a passenger ferry, sank off the coast of Cagayan on September 16, resulting in the deaths of at least 10 people. The ferry was traveling from the town of Lal-lo to the city of Tuguegarao when it encountered strong winds and heavy rain associated with Doksuri.\n\n###Taiwan\n\nDoksuri brought strong winds and heavy rain to southeastern Taiwan on September 16, causing widespread power outages and flooding in several areas. At least two people were killed and several others injured in the storm.\n\n###China\n\nFujian\n\nDoksuri brought strong winds and heavy rain to Fujian province on September 16, causing widespread power outages and flooding in several areas. At least five people were killed and several others injured in the storm.\n\nBeijing, Jilin and Hebei\n\nDoksuri brought strong winds and heavy rain to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region on September 17, causing widespread power outages and flooding in several areas. At least two people were killed and several others injured in the storm.\n\n###Vietnam\n\nDoksuri made landfall in central Vietnam on September 17, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to several areas. At least 13 people were killed and several others injured in the storm. The storm also caused widespread damage to crops and infrastructure.\n\n**#Aftermath**\n\n###China\n\nThe Chinese government estimated that the national losses due to Doksuri were around 10 billion yuan (1.4 billion USD). The storm also caused significant damage to crops and infrastructure in several provinces, including Fujian and Guangdong.\n\n**#Retirement**\n\nDoksuri was retired from the naming list for the western Pacific Ocean by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center in 2018.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* List of typhoons in the Philippines\n* List of typhoons in Taiwan\n* List of typhoons in China\n* List of typhoons in Vietnam\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* This article is based on information available up to September 2017.\n* The information provided is subject to change as more data becomes available.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of the storm and its impact, and may not include all details or specific information.\n\n**#References**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC)\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)\n* Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (TCWB)\n* Chinese National Meteorological Center (CNMC)\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) - Typhoon Doksuri (1719)\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) - Typhoon Doksuri\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) - Typhoon Doksuri (Maring)\n* Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (TCWB) - Typhoon Doksuri\n* Chinese National Meteorological Center (CNMC) - Typhoon Doksuri", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Doksuri\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Philippines\n##Taiwan\n##China\n#Impact\n##Philippines\n###Widespread flooding\n###MB Aya Express\n##Taiwan\n##China\n###Fujian\n###Beijing, Jilin and Hebei\n##Vietnam\n#Aftermath\n##China\n###National losses\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\nThe Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case, decided on June 24, 2022, was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that overruled the constitutional right to abortion established by the court in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision. The ruling effectively allowed states to regulate or prohibit abortion, and it has had significant impacts on the healthcare landscape, politics, and society in the United States.\n\n# Background\n\n## Common Law\n\nPrior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the legality of abortion varied from state to state, with some allowing it under certain circumstances and others prohibiting it altogether. The common law stance on abortion was largely influenced by the English legal tradition, which considered abortion to be a crime and subject to prosecution.\n\n## Constitutional Right\n\nIn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that the right to abortion was a constitutional right derived from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court established a trimester framework for regulating abortion, with varying levels of state oversight and regulation at different stages of pregnancy. This framework was modified in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which introduced the \"undue burden\" standard for evaluating abortion regulations.\n\n## Evolution of the Composition of the Supreme Court\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court has undergone significant changes since the Roe v. Wade decision. In the 2020 presidential election, President Donald Trump appointed three conservative justices, including Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, which shifted the court's ideological balance. The addition of these justices created a 6-3 conservative majority, which was seen as a significant threat to abortion rights.\n\n# Gestational Age Act\n\n## Lower Courts\n\nThe case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization originated in the state of Mississippi, where the state legislature had enacted the Gestational Age Act in 2018. The act prohibited abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, with exceptions for medical emergencies or cases where the fetus was determined to be viable. The Jackson Women's Health Organization, a local abortion clinic, challenged the act in federal court, arguing that it was unconstitutional.\n\nThe lower courts, including the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled in favor of the state of Mississippi, upholding the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, which was argued in December 2021.\n\n# Supreme Court\n\n## Oral Argument\n\nThe oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was notable for its confrontational and tense tone. The justices engaged in a spirited debate, with the conservative justices questioning the constitutionality of the abortion right and the liberal justices defending it. The argument centered on the question of whether the federal Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, and whether the states have the authority to regulate or prohibit abortion.\n\n## Leaked Draft Opinion\n\nIn May 2022, a leaked draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was published by Politico, revealing that the court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The leaked opinion, which was later confirmed by the court, stated that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the authority to regulate abortion should be returned to the states.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion sparked widespread outrage and protests across the United States. Women's rights groups, reproductive health organizations, and advocates for social justice condemned the decision as a threat to women's autonomy and equality. The leak also sparked a heated debate about the court's legitimacy and the role of the judiciary in American society.\n\n### Investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court launched an investigation into the leak, with Chief Justice John Roberts ordering an investigation by the Marshal of the Court. The investigation was led by a team of outside investigators, who reviewed security footage and interviewed court employees.\n\n# Opinions\n\n## Majority Opinion\n\nThe majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was written by Justice Samuel Alito and joined by all five conservative justices. The opinion held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the authority to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The opinion also struck down the trimester framework established in Roe v. Wade and the undue burden standard established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n## Concurrences\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence in which he argued that the court's decision should not be limited to the case of abortion. He argued that the court should reconsider its decision in other cases that have established constitutional rights, including the right to same-sex marriage and the right to same-sex intimacy.\n\n## Concurrence in Judgment\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurrence in judgment, in which he agreed with the majority that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. However, he argued that the majority's opinion should not be read to suggest that the states have unfettered authority to regulate abortion.\n\n## Dissent\n\nThe dissenting opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. The dissent argued that the majority's decision was a grave injustice that would have far-reaching consequences for women's health and equality.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Pre-decision\n\nPrior to the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, abortion was a highly contentious issue in the United States. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade had established a constitutional right to abortion, but the court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey had created a regulatory framework that allowed states to impose certain restrictions on abortion.\n\n## Post-decision\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant impacts on the healthcare landscape, politics, and society in the United States. The decision has allowed states to regulate or prohibit abortion, leading to a wave of new laws and regulations that restrict access to abortion.\n\n### State Laws Restricting Abortion\n\nSince the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, numerous states have enacted laws restricting abortion. These laws include bans on abortion after a certain gestational age, restrictions on abortion procedures, and requirements for abortion clinics to meet certain standards.\n\n#### EMTALA and Federal Preemption\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has also raised questions about the application of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) to abortion. EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency treatment, including abortion, in certain circumstances. The decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has led to concerns that states may be able to preempt federal law and restrict access to abortion.\n\n### State Laws Expanding Abortion Access\n\nWhile many states have restricted access to abortion, others have expanded access to abortion. These laws include repeals of restrictive abortion laws, expansion of Medicaid coverage for abortion, and creation of safe havens for women seeking abortion.\n\n### Congressional Proposals\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has also led to a series of congressional proposals aimed at codifying the right to abortion. These proposals include the Women's Health Protection Act, which would prohibit states from restricting access to abortion, and the EACH Act, which would require Medicaid coverage for abortion.\n\n### Executive Action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has taken executive action to protect access to abortion. In 2022, he issued an executive order aimed at protecting access to abortion and reproductive healthcare. The order prohibits states from restricting access to abortion and requires health insurers to cover abortion services.\n\n### Medical Abortion, In Vitro Fertilization, and Other Processes\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has also raised questions about the application of abortion laws to other medical procedures. Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes have been the subject of controversy and debate.\n\n### Data Privacy\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has also raised concerns about data privacy. The decision has led to concerns that states may be able to collect sensitive information about women seeking abortion, including their personal medical history and other sensitive information.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States Election Seasons\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has become a major issue in the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons.

Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant effects on abortion rates in the United States.

Jackson Women's Health Organization has also had significant effects on infant mortality rates in the United States.

The protests, which began as a convoy of truckers traveling to Ottawa, eventually grew into a nationwide movement, resulting in disruptions to Canadian life and significant economic losses.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Canada convoy protest was the culmination of several months of growing frustration among Canadians regarding the federal government's COVID-19 policies, particularly the mandatory vaccination requirements for truckers and other essential workers. The protests were organized by a coalition of groups, including the Canadian Trucking Alliance and the United We Roll movement, which had been advocating for the repeal of the vaccine mandates and passports.\n\n### Protest Goals\n\nThe primary goals of the convoy protest were to:\n\n1. Demand the repeal of the federal government's COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports for truckers and other essential workers.\n2. Advocate for the preservation of individual freedoms and autonomy in the face of government overreach.\n3. Promote the idea of a unified Canada, without borders or divisions.\n\n### Initial Events and the Start of the Protest\n\nThe convoy protest began in late January 2022, when a group of truckers and supporters gathered in Alberta, Canada, to organize a cross-country convoy to Ottawa. The event was initially promoted on social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, and quickly gained traction.\n\n#### American Influence\n\nThe convoy protest was largely organized by American expatriates and Canadians living in the United States, who were motivated by their opposition to the Biden administration's COVID-19 policies. The involvement of American influencers and donors helped to galvanize support for the protest and attract international attention.\n\n#### Fundraising\n\nThe convoy protest was largely funded by a network of donors, including wealthy individuals and corporations. The fundraising efforts were coordinated through a series of online platforms, including GoFundMe and GiveSendGo. The funds raised were used to support the truckers and their families, as well as to cover the costs of fuel, food, and accommodations.\n\n#### Donor List Hacked\n\nIn early February 2022, a hacker group gained access to the donor list for the convoy protest and published the information online. The hacked list revealed the identities of many of the donors, including several high-profile individuals and companies.\n\n**Vaccine Mandates and Passports**\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were a key issue driving the convoy protest. The federal government had introduced the requirements as part of its efforts to combat the spread of the virus, but many Canadians felt that the measures were an overreach of government authority.\n\n#### Vaccination Requirements for US–Canada Cross-Border Travel\n\nIn November 2021, the US government announced that it would require all individuals traveling by air or land from Canada to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19. The requirement was part of a broader effort to prevent the spread of the virus across the US-Canada border.\n\n**Convoy to Ottawa**\n\nThe convoy protest began its journey from Alberta, Canada, in late January 2022. The convoy was led by a group of truckers and supporters, who were accompanied by a large entourage of vehicles, including cars, buses, and motorcycles. The convoy traveled across the country, stopping at various locations along the way to raise awareness and gather support for the protest.\n\n**Ottawa Protest**\n\nThe convoy protest arrived in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, on February 6, 2022. The protest was initially peaceful, but tensions escalated as the days passed. The protesters set up a large encampment on Parliament Hill, where they remained for several weeks, disrupting the normal functioning of the government.\n\n#### Peak Size of Parliament Hill Demonstration\n\nThe peak size of the Parliament Hill demonstration was estimated to be around 10,000 people, although some reports suggested that the number may have been higher. The protesters were a diverse group, including truckers, farmers, and ordinary citizens from across Canada.\n\n#### Desecration and Community Harassment\n\nAs the protest continued, the protesters began to engage in desecration and community harassment. The protesters vandalized government property, including the National War Memorial, and harassed local residents. The behavior of the protesters was widely condemned by the community and the media.\n\n#### Ottawa Protests and Entrenchment\n\nThe Ottawa protests continued for several weeks, with the protesters digging in and refusing to leave. The government responded by deploying the military to the area, but the protesters remained entrenched. The protests eventually subsided, but not before significant damage had been done to the city and its infrastructure.\n\n#### After Clearance\n\nThe protests in Ottawa were eventually cleared, but not before the city had suffered significant economic losses. The damage to the city's infrastructure was estimated to be in the millions of dollars, and the cleanup effort was a long and difficult process.\n\n**Major Blockades**\n\nThe convoy protest also involved several major blockades across Canada. The blockades were set up at key border crossings, including the Alberta-Montana border and the Ontario-Michigan border.\n\n#### Alberta–Montana\n\nThe Alberta-Montana border was one of the first major blockades to be set up. The blockade was established by a group of truckers and supporters, who refused to allow traffic to cross the border. The blockade lasted for several days, causing significant disruptions to trade and commerce.\n\n#### Ontario–Michigan\n\nThe Ontario-Michigan border was another key location for the convoy protest. The blockade was established by a group of truckers and supporters, who refused to allow traffic to cross the border. The blockade lasted for several days, causing significant disruptions to trade and commerce.\n\n**Participants and Response**\n\nThe convoy protest was a complex and multifaceted event, involving a wide range of participants and responses. The protest was organized by a coalition of groups, including the Canadian Trucking Alliance and the United We Roll movement.\n\n#### Groups\n\nThe convoy protest was supported by a wide range of groups, including:\n\n* The Canadian Trucking Alliance\n* The United We Roll movement\n* The Freedom Convoy 2022\n* The People's Party of Canada\n\n#### Counter-Protests\n\nThe convoy protest was met with counter-protests from a range of groups, including:\n\n* The Liberal Party of Canada\n* The New Democratic Party of Canada\n* The Green Party of Canada\n* The Canadian Civil Liberties Association\n\n#### Ottawa Police Service Response\n\nThe Ottawa Police Service responded to the convoy protest with a range of measures, including:\n\n* Deploying riot police to the area\n* Establishing a perimeter around Parliament Hill\n* Issuing warnings and fines to protesters\n\n#### Integrated Command Centre Response\n\nThe Integrated Command Centre was established to coordinate the response to the convoy protest. The centre was staffed by a team of officials from the Ottawa Police Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other agencies.\n\n#### Clearance\n\nThe convoy protest was eventually cleared by the authorities, but not before significant damage had been done to the city and its infrastructure.\n\n**Municipal Response**\n\nThe municipal response to the convoy protest was varied, with some cities and towns supporting the protest and others condemning it.\n\n#### Provincial Response\n\nThe provincial response to the convoy protest was also varied, with some provinces supporting the protest and others condemning it.\n\n#### Federal Response\n\nThe federal response to the convoy protest was led by the Liberal Party of Canada, which condemned the protest as an \"occupation\" and an \"insurrection\".\n\n#### Emergencies Act\n\nThe federal government invoked the Emergencies Act in an effort to quell the convoy protest. The Act gave the government emergency powers, including the ability to freeze assets and restrict movement.\n\n**Related Events**\n\nThe convoy protest was part of a larger series of protests and blockades that took place across Canada in February 2022.\n\n#### Other Border Crossing Obstructions\n\nThe convoy protest was not the only border crossing obstruction to take place in February 2022. Other obstructions included:\n\n* British Columbia-Washington border\n* Manitoba-North Dakota border\n\n#### Other Canadian Protests\n\nThe convoy protest was part of a larger series of protests and blockades that took place across Canada in February 2022. Other protests included:\n\n* Toronto\n* Winnipeg\n* Fredericton\n* Nova Scotia\n* Edmonton\n* Other locations\n\n#### International Protests\n\nThe convoy protest was met with international attention and support. Protesters from around the world, including the United States, Europe, and Australia, expressed their solidarity with the Canadian protesters.\n\n#### Rolling Thunder Ottawa\n\nThe Rolling Thunder Ottawa protest was a motorcycle protest that took place in Ottawa in April 2022. The protest was organized by a group of motorcyclists who were opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports.\n\n**Results and Aftermath**\n\nThe convoy protest resulted in significant economic losses and damage to the city and its infrastructure. The protest also led to a range of investigations and lawsuits.\n\n#### Parliamentary Committee Investigations\n\nThe convoy protest led to several parliamentary committee investigations, including:\n\n* FINA Committee\n* SECU Committee\n* PROC Committee\n* DEDC Committee\n* Public Order Emergency Commission\n\n#### Economic Loss and Costs\n\nThe convoy protest resulted in significant economic losses and costs, including:\n\n* In Ottawa: estimated to be in the millions of dollars\n* Alberta-Montana: estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars\n* Ontario-Michigan: estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars\n* Manitoba-North Dakota: estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars\n\n#### Criticism of Ottawa Police\n\nThe convoy protest led to criticism of the Ottawa Police Service for its handling of the protest.

His father's influence would later shape Amis's writing style and subject matter. Amis's early life was marked by a strict upbringing, with a strong emphasis on education and a love of literature.\n\n# Early writing\n\nAmis began writing at an early age, producing short stories and poetry while still a teenager. His first published work, a short story called \"The Last Days of a Hero,\" appeared in the New Statesman in 1969. This early writing was met with critical acclaim, and Amis soon gained recognition as a talented young writer.\n\n# Main career\n\n## 1980s and 1990s\n\nAmis's first novel, \"The Rachel Papers,\" was published in 1973, but it was his 1984 novel \"Money\" that brought him widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. This novel, a satirical exploration of Thatcherite Britain, cemented Amis's reputation as a major literary talent. The 1980s and 1990s saw the publication of several more novels, including \"London Fields\" (1989) and \"Time's Arrow\" (1991), both of which further solidified Amis's position as a leading writer.\n\n## 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw Amis continue to push the boundaries of literary fiction. His 2000 novel \"The Information\" explored the intersection of technology and humanity, while 2003's \"House of Meetings\" delved into the complexities of human relationships and identity. Amis's writing during this period was characterized by its lyricism, complexity, and often provocative subject matter.\n\n## 2010s and 2020s\n\nIn the 2010s, Amis continued to write novels that explored a wide range of themes and subjects. His 2014 novel \"The Zone of Interest\" examined the complexities of human relationships and the nature of evil, while 2018's \"Inside Story\" offered a satirical exploration of modern society. Amis's writing in the 2020s has continued to be marked by its lyricism and complexity, with a focus on exploring the human condition and the world around us.\n\n## Other work\n\n### University of Manchester\n\nIn 2013, Amis was appointed as a professor of creative writing at the University of Manchester, a position he held until 2016. During his time at the university, Amis taught creative writing and offered guidance to students, drawing on his own experiences as a writer.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Death\n\nMartin Amis passed away on August 19, 2023, at the age of 73. His death was met with widespread tributes from the literary community, with many praising his innovative and provocative writing style.\n\n# Views\n\n## Writing\n\nAmis has long been known for his provocative and often controversial views on writing and literature. He has argued that the role of the writer is to challenge and subvert conventional thinking, and that the best writing is often that which is most difficult to understand.\n\n## Nuclear proliferation\n\nAmis has been a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation, arguing that the threat of nuclear war is one of the greatest dangers facing humanity. His 1986 novel \"The Rachel Papers\" explores the theme of nuclear war, and Amis has continued to write about the subject throughout his career.\n\n## Geopolitics\n\nAmis has been critical of Western intervention in the Middle East, arguing that it has often been motivated by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to promote democracy and stability. His 2014 novel \"The Zone of Interest\" explores the complexities of human relationships and the nature of evil in the context of World War II and its aftermath.\n\n## Electoral politics\n\nAmis has been critical of the electoral politics of modern society, arguing that the emphasis on spin and image over substance has led to a decline in intellectual and moral discourse. His 2000 novel \"The Information\" explores the intersection of technology and humanity, and Amis has continued to write about the impact of technology on society.\n\n## Islam and Islamism\n\nAmis has written extensively about Islam and Islamism, arguing that the religion is often misunderstood and misrepresented in the Western media. His 1989 novel \"London Fields\" explores the theme of identity and belonging in the context of a multicultural society.\n\n## Euthanasia\n\nAmis has been a vocal supporter of euthanasia, arguing that it is a fundamental human right to be able to die with dignity. His 2014 novel \"The Zone of Interest\" explores the complexities of human relationships and the nature of evil, and Amis has continued to write about the subject throughout his career.\n\n## Agnosticism\n\nAmis has described himself as an agnostic, arguing that the existence of God is a mystery that cannot be proven or disproven. His writing often explores the human condition and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n## Novels\n\n* The Rachel Papers (1973)\n* Dead Babies (1975)\n* Success (1978)\n* Money (1984)\n* London Fields (1989)\n* Time's Arrow (1991)\n* The Information (2000)\n* House of Meetings (2003)\n* The Zone of Interest (2014)\n* Inside Story (2018)\n\n## Short fiction\n\n* \"The Last Days of a Hero\" (1969)\n* \"The Pregnant Wife\" (1970)\n* \"A Visit from the Goon Squad\" (1970)\n\n## Non-fiction\n\n* Visiting Mrs. Nabokov: And Other Excursions (1993)\n* Experience (2000)\n* The Second Plane (2008)\n\n## Screenplays\n\n* The Rachel Papers (1989)\n* The Big Time (1990)\n* The Information (2001)\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on the author's own research and is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of Martin Amis's life and work.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Martin Amis: A Biography (2012) by Francis Wyndham\n* The Cambridge Companion to Martin Amis (2016) edited by David Malcolm\n\n# External links\n\n* Martin Amis's official website\n* Martin Amis at the Internet Book List\n* Martin Amis at the British Council's Literature website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Martin_Amis\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early writing\n#Main career\n##1980s and 1990s\n##2000s\n##2010s and 2020s\n##Other work\n###University of Manchester\n#Personal life\n##Death\n#Views\n##Writing\n##Nuclear proliferation\n##Geopolitics\n##Electoral politics\n##Islam and Islamism\n##Euthanasia\n##Agnosticism\n#Bibliography\n##Novels\n##Short fiction\n##Non-fiction\n##Screenplays\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His crimes were characterized by the brutal and methodical killing of young men, often using tactics such as strangulation and stabbing. Bonin's case drew significant media attention and public interest due to the sheer number of victims and the gruesome nature of the crimes.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### Childhood\n\nWilliam George Bonin was born on January 8, 1947, in Los Angeles, California. His early life was marked by a tumultuous home environment, with his parents divorcing when he was just six years old. Bonin's father, a veteran of World War II, struggled with alcoholism and was often absent from the family home. His mother, a homemaker, struggled to manage the household and provide for her children.\n\n### Adolescence\n\nBonin's teenage years were marked by academic underachievement and behavioral problems. He was often in trouble at school and was known to engage in vandalism and antisocial behavior. His parents' divorce had a significant impact on his emotional well-being, and he began to develop a pattern of aggression and violence towards others.\n\n### Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n\nIn 1965, at the age of 18, Bonin joined the U.S. Air Force. He served for several years, but his time in the military was marked by disciplinary problems and a string of minor infractions. He was eventually discharged from the Air Force in 1967, at which point he began to drift in and out of various jobs and relationships.\n\n**First convictions**\n\nBonin's first conviction for a violent crime came in 1968, when he was arrested and charged with assaulting a woman in a bar fight. He pleaded guilty to the charge and received a suspended sentence. However, this was just the beginning of his pattern of violence and aggression.\n\n**Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison**\n\nIn 1974, Bonin was arrested and charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man during a drunken altercation. He was sentenced to prison time at Atascadero State Hospital, where he began to develop a pattern of inciting violence and aggression towards other inmates.\n\n### Further offenses and imprisonment\n\nOver the next several years, Bonin continued to accumulate convictions for violent crimes, including assault and battery. He was transferred to Vacaville State Prison, where he spent several years in solitary confinement for disciplinary infractions.\n\n**Release**\n\nIn 1978, after serving several years in prison, Bonin was released on parole. He quickly returned to his old patterns of behavior, engaging in vandalism and petty theft. However, his true intentions were far more sinister.\n\n### Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n\nWhile out on parole, Bonin began to associate with two other individuals,", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William_Bonin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Childhood\n##Adolescence\n##Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n#First convictions\n#Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n##Further offenses and imprisonment\n#Release\n##Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n#Murders\n##1979\n###May\n###August\n###September through December\n##1980\n###January and February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n#Arrest\n##Confession\n##Accomplices' arrest\n#Preliminary hearings\n#Murder trials\n##Los Angeles County\n###Closing arguments\n###Conviction\n###Sentencing\n##Orange County\n###Second conviction\n#Death row\n##Appeals\n#Execution\n#Aftermath\n#Known victims\n##1979\n##1980\n#Media\n##Film\n##Bibliography\n##Television\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Cited works and further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Ember is a passionate and adventurous individual who dreams of exploring the world beyond her city. She befriends Wade, a water elemental who is quiet and reserved. Despite their differences, the two form a strong bond and begin to navigate the complexities of their relationship.\n\nAs Ember and Wade's relationship deepens, they face challenges from their respective elemental communities.

The film's design was influenced by various styles, including traditional animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI). Sohn wanted to create a look that was both stylized and realistic, and one that would complement the film's story and themes.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for Elemental was composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, with additional music provided by Ludwig Göransson. The film's soundtrack features a mix of original songs and score, with the music serving to enhance the story and emotions.

The show is a spin-off of the popular reality series Bigg Boss, and it features a group of contestants living together in a house with cameras and microphones recording their every move 24/7.\n\n# Production\n\nThe production of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 was handled by Endemol Shine India, a subsidiary of the Dutch-based production company Endemol Shine Group. The show was hosted by Bollywood actor, Karan Wahi, who has been hosting the Bigg Boss franchise since 2018. The show's concept and creative direction were handled by Anil Kapoor, the founder of the production company, and the show's editor was Rakesh Kumar.\n\n# Concept\n\nThe concept of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 was to bring together a group of contestants from different walks of life and put them in a house with no luxuries and no privileges. The contestants were expected to live together, share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and compete with each other to win the title of Bigg Boss Ultimate. The show was designed to test the contestants' mental and physical strength, their ability to work as a team, and their capacity to handle stress and pressure.\n\n# Twist in Finale Week\n\nOne of the twists in the finale week was the introduction of a new rule, where the contestants were given a choice to either save one of their fellow contestants from eviction or to save themselves. This twist added an element of uncertainty and unpredictability to the show, as the contestants had to weigh their options carefully and make a decision that would affect their own fate and the fate of their fellow contestants.\n\n# Housemates Status\n\nThe contestants in Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 were divided into two categories: the housemates and the wildcard contestants. The housemates were the original contestants who entered the house on the first day, while the wildcard contestants were introduced later in the season as a surprise twist. The housemates were divided into two groups: the strong contenders and the weak contenders. The strong contenders were the ones who were likely to win the title of Bigg Boss Ultimate, while the weak contenders were the ones who were struggling to stay in the game.\n\nHere is a list of the housemates and their status at the end of the season:\n\n* Strong Contenders:\n\t+ Shamita Shetty\n\t+ Karan Wahi\n\t+ Tina Dutta\n\t+ Rohit Suchanti\n* Weak Contenders:\n\t+ Meisha Iyer\n\t+ Aashish Sharma\n\t+ Anurag Tiwari\n\t+ Rakhi Sawant\n\n# Most Nominated in Eviction\n\nThe contestant who received the most nominations for eviction was Rakhi Sawant, who was nominated seven times throughout the season. Rakhi was known for her outspoken and aggressive behavior, which made her a target for the other contestants. Despite her nominations, Rakhi managed to survive until the final week, where she was ultimately evicted from the house.\n\n# Housemates with Status Improvements\n\nSome of the housemates who experienced a significant improvement in their status throughout the season were:\n\n* Shamita Shetty: Shamita was initially seen as a strong contender, but she struggled to cope with the pressure and stress of the game. However, she managed to turn things around in the second half of the season and became one of the strongest contenders.\n* Karan Wahi: Karan was initially seen as a weak contender, but he managed to improve his game by forming alliances and winning tasks. He became one of the strongest contenders in the final week and was ultimately declared the winner of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1.\n* Tina Dutta: Tina was initially seen as a weak contender, but she managed to improve her game by forming alliances and winning tasks. She became one of the strongest contenders in the final week and was ultimately declared the runner-up of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1.\n\n# Overall Previous Season Status\n\nBigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 was the first season of the franchise, and it set the tone for future seasons. The show was a massive hit, and it received widespread critical acclaim for its concept, production, and execution. The show's host, Karan Wahi, received praise for his hosting skills, and the contestants were praised for their participation and performances.\n\n# Housemates\n\n## Wildcard Contestants\n\nThe wildcard contestants were introduced in the second half of the season as a surprise twist. They were contestants who were not part of the original group, but were added to the house to shake things up. The wildcard contestants were:\n\n* Aashish Sharma: Aashish was a model and actor who was known for his good looks and charming personality. He was added to the house in the second half of the season and quickly became a popular contestant.\n* Anurag Tiwari: Anurag was a model and actor who was known for his good looks and charming personality. He was added to the house in the second half of the season and quickly became a popular contestant.\n* Rakhi Sawant: Rakhi was a model and actress who was known for her outspoken and aggressive behavior. She was added to the house in the second half of the season and quickly became a target for the other contestants.\n\n# Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison\n\nOne of the twists in the season was the introduction of Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison, where the contestants were locked in a cell and had to survive on limited resources. The contestants had to work together to win tasks and earn rewards, but they also had to deal with the consequences of their actions in the house.\n\n# Trending Player\n\nThe trending player of the season was Karan Wahi, who was initially seen as a weak contender but managed to improve his game by forming alliances and winning tasks. He became one of the strongest contenders in the final week and was ultimately declared the winner of Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1.\n\n# Cash Reward and Bomb\n\nThe contestants in Bigg Boss Ultimate Season 1 had the opportunity to win cash rewards and prizes by participating in tasks and challenges. However, they also had to deal with the consequences of their actions, such as being nominated for eviction or being sent to the Bigg Boss Ultimate Prison.\n\n# Weekly Summary\n\nHere is a summary of

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread supply chain disruptions, resulting in shortages of essential ingredients and materials. Additionally, the shortage of truck drivers and warehouse workers contributed to the delays in shipping and receiving infant formula.\n\n### Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, the infant formula manufacturer Abbott Nutrition recalled several of its products due to contamination concerns. The company's Sturgis, Michigan plant was shut down as a result, further exacerbating the shortage.\n\n#### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nThe Sturgis plant has been the subject of controversy and allegations of poor quality control and safety practices. In September 2021, the plant was cited by the FDA for 13 serious violations, including inadequate sanitation and contamination control. The plant was also accused of producing infant formula with high levels of bacteria, including Cronobacter sakazakii, which can cause life-threatening infections in infants.\n\n### Import restrictions\n\nThe United States has strict regulations on the importation of infant formula, which has limited the ability of companies to import formula from other countries. The FDA requires that imported formula meet strict safety and labeling standards, which can be time-consuming and costly to meet.\n\n### Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market is dominated by a few large manufacturers, including Abbott Nutrition, Enfamil, and Gerber. This concentration of market share has led to concerns about the fragility of the supply chain and the potential for disruptions to affect a large proportion of the market.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe infant formula shortage has had significant effects on families, healthcare providers, and the broader community:\n\n## Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nThe shortage has led to an increased demand for breast milk donations. Breastfeeding support groups and milk banks have seen an uptick in requests for donations, with some organizations reporting a 50% increase in demand.\n\n## Use of alternative foods\n\nFamilies have been forced to turn to alternative foods, including cow's milk and oat-based formulas, to feed their infants. However, these alternatives may not provide the same nutritional benefits as traditional infant formula.\n\n## Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage has led to an increase in hospitalizations related to infant formula. According to reports, some hospitals have seen a 20% increase in admissions due to formula-related issues, including dehydration and malnutrition.\n\n## Bot usage\n\nThe shortage has led to an increase in bot usage, with online platforms experiencing a surge in demand for infant formula. Some companies have reported a 500% increase in online sales, with many customers turning to social media and online forums to seek out alternative sources of formula.\n\n## Shortage in Canada\n\nThe infant formula shortage has also affected Canada, with some provinces experiencing widespread shortages. The Canadian government has taken steps to address the shortage, including importing formula from other countries and increasing production at domestic manufacturers.\n\n**Responses**\n\nIn response to the shortage, the government, manufacturers, and other stakeholders have taken various steps to address the issue:\n\n## Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action to prevent price gouging, with some companies being accused of increasing prices by as much as 500%.

His achievements in the water, including several record-breaking swims, made him a celebrated figure in the world of competitive swimming at the time.\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n\n##Catalina swim training\n\nYoung's early start in swimming training took place in the Catalina Channel, a renowned location for long-distance swimming. The Catalina Channel, which connects the California mainland to Santa Catalina Island, is approximately 21 miles (34 km) long and has been the site of numerous notable swims since the early 20th century. Young spent a significant amount of time training in the Catalina Channel, honing his skills and building the endurance required for long-distance swimming.\n\n#Catalina channel swim\n\nYoung's most notable achievement in the Catalina Channel was completing the swim in a remarkable 8 hours and 50 minutes. This impressive feat was accomplished despite the challenges posed by the channel's strong currents and unpredictable weather conditions. Young's swim was notable not only for its duration but also for its difficulty, as he swam against the tide for a significant portion of the swim.\n\n##Swam with tides\n\nYoung's experience swimming with the tides in the Catalina Channel was invaluable in his development as a long-distance swimmer. Swimming with the tides requires a great deal of skill and strategy, as the swimmer must navigate the changing currents and water temperatures. Young's ability to adapt to these conditions was a key factor in his success in the Catalina Channel swim.\n\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung faced significant competition from Norman Ross, another renowned long-distance swimmer of the time. Ross was a formidable opponent who had already established himself as a leading figure in the sport. Young's swims in the Catalina Channel were closely watched by Ross and the swimming community at large, with many expecting Ross to emerge victorious. However, Young's impressive performances in the channel ultimately earned him widespread recognition and respect from his peers.\n\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nDespite his many achievements in the Catalina Channel, Young's success did not translate into significant financial gain. In contrast to many modern-day professional athletes, Young received little in the way of financial compensation for his swims. However, he gained widespread public acclaim, with many of his swims being reported on in major newspapers and magazines of the time. Young's achievements in the water helped to popularize the sport of long-distance swimming, paving the way for future generations of swimmers.\n\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by periods of inconsistent performance. Despite his many achievements in the Catalina Channel, he struggled to replicate his success in other swims. This inconsistency was often due to factors such as changing water conditions, fatigue, and mental pressure.\n\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young attempted to swim 21 miles in Lake Ontario, a significant undertaking that would have required him to swim for an extended period. Unfortunately, Young was forced to abandon the swim after several hours due to the challenging water conditions and his own fatigue.\n\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nYoung made another attempt to swim in Lake Ontario in 1928, this time aiming to cover a distance of 15 miles. While he was able to complete the swim, his performance was not as impressive as his earlier efforts in the Catalina Channel.\n\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young competed in the Montreal to Repentigney marathon, a challenging swim that required him to navigate the treacherous waters of the St. Lawrence River. Despite the difficulties posed by the swim, Young emerged victorious, completing the marathon in a respectable time.\n\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nYoung's swimming career continued to be marked by inconsistency in 1929, when he attempted to swim 15 miles in Lake Ontario. While he was able to complete the swim, his performance was not as impressive as his earlier efforts in the water.\n\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1930, Young made another attempt to swim 15 miles in Lake Ontario. Unfortunately, he was forced to abandon the swim after several hours due to the challenging water conditions and his own fatigue.\n\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young finally achieved a notable victory in Lake Ontario, completing a 15-mile swim in a respectable time. This win marked a significant turning point in Young's swimming career, as it showed that he was still capable of achieving great things in the water.\n\n#Late swim career\n\nYoung's swimming career continued to be marked by periods of inconsistency in the years leading up to his retirement. Despite this, he was still able to achieve notable victories in various swims, earning him continued respect and admiration from the swimming community.\n\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n\nYoung retired from competitive swimming in the 1930s, marking the end of an illustrious career that had spanned several decades. Following his retirement, Young went on to marry and start a family. His marriage was a long and happy one, and he was able to devote himself to his family and his community.\n\n##Marriages\n\nYoung was married twice, first to a woman named Mary, with whom he had several children. After Mary's passing, Young married again, this time to a woman named Elizabeth. His second marriage was a happy and fulfilling one, and he was able to build a new life with his new wife.\n\n#Late professional life\n\nAfter his retirement from competitive swimming, Young went on to pursue a career in business. He worked as a manager for a large corporation, using his organizational skills and experience to help the company grow and thrive. Young's success in business was a testament to his hard work and dedication, and he was able to build a comfortable and secure life for himself and his family.\n\n#Honors\n\nYoung's achievements in the world of competitive swimming earned him numerous honors and accolades. He was recognized as one of the top long-distance swimmers of his generation, and his name became synonymous with endurance and determination in the sport.\n\n#See also\n\nFor more information on George Young's life and career, readers may want to refer to the following resources:\n\n* The Catalina Channel Swim: A History of the World's Most Famous Swim\n* Long-Distance Swimming: A History of the Sport\n* The Life and Times of George Young\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not contain any references.\n\n#External links\n\nFor more information on George Young and his achievements, readers may want to visit the following websites:\n\n* The Catalina Channel Swim Association\n* The Long-Distance Swimming Hall of Fame\n* The George Young Foundation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the sequel to the 2009 film Avatar and the second installment in the Avatar franchise. The film stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang, among others.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place 13 years after the events of the first film. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) have built a new life on Pandora, and they have two children, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton). However, the Na'vi are under threat from the human colonizers, who are determined to mine the planet's valuable resources.\n\nThe story follows Lo'ak, who is struggling to find his place in the Na'vi world. He is fascinated by the humans and their technology, but he is also torn between his loyalty to his family and his own sense of identity. Meanwhile, Jake and Neytiri are dealing with their own challenges, as they try to protect their family and their people from the human threat.\n\nThe film takes a dramatic turn when a group of humans, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), arrive on Pandora with a new mission to capture the Na'vi and use them as trophies for the human military. Jake and Neytiri must use all their skills and knowledge to protect their family and their people, and to fight against the human colonizers.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully\n* Zoe Saldana as Neytiri\n* Sigourney Weaver as Kiri\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at\n* Edie Falco as General Ardmore\n* Brendan Cowell as Captain Kirkling\n* Jack Champion as Spider\n* Trinity Bliss as Tuk\n* Filip Geljo as Aonung\n* Duane Evans Jr. as Rotxo\n\n**Themes and analysis**\n\nThe film explores several themes, including the struggle for identity and belonging, the importance of family and community, and the clash between different cultures and values. The film also raises questions about the ethics of colonialism and the exploitation of natural resources.\n\nOne of the main themes of the film is the struggle for identity and belonging, particularly for Lo'ak, who is torn between his human and Na'vi heritage. This theme is reflected in the film's use of visual effects, particularly in the sequences where Lo'ak interacts with the natural world and the Na'vi culture.\n\nThe film also explores the importance of family and community, particularly in the scenes where Jake and Neytiri are shown caring for their children and protecting their people. This theme is reflected in the film's use of character development and emotional storytelling.\n\nThe clash between different cultures and values is also a major theme of the film, particularly in the scenes where the humans and Na'vi interact. This theme is reflected in the film's use of dialogue and character development, particularly in the scenes where the characters are shown grappling with their own biases and assumptions.\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2010, just after the release of the first film. James Cameron had always planned to make a sequel to Avatar, and he began working on the script and storyboards shortly after the first film was released.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe script for the film was written by James Cameron, and it took several years to complete. Cameron has said that he was inspired by a number of different sources, including the natural world of Pandora and the cultures of the indigenous peoples of the world.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, and it took several years to find the right actors for the roles. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana reprised their roles as Jake Sully and Neytiri, and they were joined by a number of new actors, including Stephen Lang and Jamie Flatters.\n\n### Filming\n\nThe film was shot using a combination of live-action and performance capture techniques. The live-action sequences were shot in Hawaii and New Zealand, while the performance capture sequences were shot in a studio in Los Angeles.\n\n#### Performance capture\n\nThe performance capture sequences were shot using a system of cameras and sensors that tracked the actors' movements and expressions. The system was developed by James Cameron and his team, and it allowed for highly realistic performances from the actors.\n\n#### Live-action\n\nThe live-action sequences were shot using a combination of digital and film cameras, and they were edited using a range of different software and techniques.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for the film were created by a team of artists and technicians at Weta Digital, a company based in New Zealand. The team used a range of different software and techniques to create the film's highly detailed and realistic world of Pandora.\n\n### Runtime\n\nThe film has a runtime of 3 hours and 12 minutes, making it one of the longest films of the year.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for the film was composed by James Horner and Simon Franglen, and it features a range of different instruments and styles. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, and it was mixed and mastered at Skywalker Sound in California.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film was extensive, and it included a range of different trailers, posters, and other promotional materials. The film's trailer was released in December 2021, and it quickly went viral on social media.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released in theaters on December 16, 2021, and it was a major commercial success, grossing over $2 billion at the box office.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media on April 11, 2022, and it was available on a range of different platforms, including Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising its visual effects, storytelling, and performances. The film has a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 400 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10.\n\n### Box office\n\n#### United States and Canada\n\nThe film was a major commercial success in the United States and Canada, grossing over $600 million at the box office.\n\n#### China\n\nThe film was also a major commercial success in China, grossing over $400 million at the box office.\n\n#### Other territories\n\nThe film was released in a range of other territories, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan, and it was a commercial success in each of these countries.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film received a number of awards and nominations, including several Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and BAFTA Awards.
