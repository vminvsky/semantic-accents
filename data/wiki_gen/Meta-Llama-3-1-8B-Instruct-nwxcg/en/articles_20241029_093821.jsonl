The conflict began on May 10, 2021, and continued intermittently until November 2022. The clashes involved rocket attacks by Palestinian militant groups, primarily Hamas, against Israeli cities, and Israeli military responses, including airstrikes and artillery strikes.\n\n**#Background**\n\nThe Gaza Strip has been a focal point of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict for decades. The region has been occupied by Israel since 1967, and has been subject to multiple conflicts and blockades. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip, but maintained control over its borders, airspace, and coastal waters. The Hamas militant group, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, has repeatedly clashed with Israel over issues such as the blockade, settlements, and Palestinian prisoners.\n\n**#Wider commentary**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes were widely seen as a symptom of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Analysts noted that the conflict was fueled by underlying issues such as poverty, unemployment, and a lack of access to basic services in the Gaza Strip. Others pointed to the role of Israeli settlements and the blockade in exacerbating tensions. The clashes also highlighted the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, with many residents struggling to access basic necessities such as food, water, and electricity.\n\n**#Timeline**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes began on May 10, 2021, when Hamas launched a series of rockets into Israeli cities. The Israeli military responded with airstrikes and artillery strikes, killing multiple Palestinians. The clashes continued intermittently over the next several months, with both sides suffering casualties.\n\nIn August 2021, Israel launched a major military operation in the Gaza Strip, known as Operation Guardian of the Walls. The operation aimed to weaken Hamas's military capabilities and disrupt its ability to launch rocket attacks. However, the operation was widely criticized for its impact on civilian populations, with many residents of the Gaza Strip killed or injured.\n\n**#Palestinian rocket failures**\n\nDuring the 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes, Palestinian militant groups, primarily Hamas, launched multiple rocket attacks against Israeli cities. However, many of these rockets failed to reach their targets, either due to technical issues or Israeli air defenses. Some analysts noted that the failures highlighted the technical limitations of Palestinian rocket capabilities, while others pointed to the effectiveness of Israeli air defenses.\n\n**#Diplomacy**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes were marked by multiple attempts at diplomacy. In May 2021, the United States, along with other members of the Middle East Quartet, issued a statement calling for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the clashes continued.\n\nIn August 2021, Egyptian officials attempted to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but the efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. Other countries, including Turkey and Qatar, also attempted to mediate the conflict, but to little avail.\n\n**#Possible war crimes**\n\nThe 2022 Gaza–Israel clashes were marked by multiple allegations of war crimes. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, accused both Israel and Palestinian militant groups of committing war crimes, including the targeting of civilians and the use of disproportionate force.\n\nIn August 2021, the Israeli military was accused of committing war crimes during Operation Guardian of the Walls, including the targeting of civilian homes and the use of white phosphorus. Palestinian militant groups were also accused of committing war crimes, including the targeting of Israeli civilians and the use of human shields.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n* Gaza Strip\n* Hamas\n* Israeli military\n* Human rights in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\n**#References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n* Amnesty International\n* Human Rights Watch", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Gaza–Israel_clashes\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Wider commentary\n#Timeline\n#Palestinian rocket failures\n#Diplomacy\n#Possible war crimes\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was planned and promoted by a group of Venezuelan opposition leaders, including Juan Guaidó, who was recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by several countries.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe idea of a military operation to overthrow Maduro's government had been discussed among Venezuelan opposition leaders for several years. In 2019, a group of Venezuelan expatriates, including Jordan Goudreau, began to secretly plan and promote a military operation to oust Maduro.\n\nPlanning\n--------\n\nInitial promotion: March–May 2019\n---------------------------------\n\nThe initial promotion of the operation began in March 2019, when a group of Venezuelan expatriates, including Jordan Goudreau, began to secretly plan and promote a military operation to oust Maduro. Goudreau, a former Green Beret, had been involved in several military operations in Latin America and had connections with Venezuelan opposition leaders.\n\nColombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn June 2019, Goudreau and his allies established a private military company called Silvercorp, with its base of operations in Colombia. Silvercorp was registered as a security company, but its true purpose was to provide military support to the Venezuelan opposition.\n\nNegotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn August 2019, Goudreau and his allies began to negotiate with representatives of Juan Guaidó, who was recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by several countries. The negotiations were secret and aimed to secure Guaidó's support for the military operation.\n\nAlcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn December 2019, Goudreau and his allies resumed preparations for the operation. They recruited a team of Venezuelan ex-soldiers and hired a small fleet of aircraft and boats to transport the team into Venezuela.\n\nExtradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn March 2020, a Venezuelan ex-soldier named Álex Alcalá was extradited to the United States to face charges related to the operation. Alcalá had been involved in the planning of the operation and had provided Goudreau with information about the Venezuelan military.\n\nPrior knowledge of operation\n---------------------------\n\nIt is believed that the US government had prior knowledge of the operation, but it is unclear to what extent. The US government had been involved in efforts to support the Venezuelan opposition, including providing humanitarian aid and recognizing Guaidó as the interim president.\n\nFinal preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn April and May 2020, the Associated Press published a series of articles about the operation, revealing the details of the plot and the involvement of Goudreau and his allies. The articles caused a scandal and led to the cancellation of the operation.\n\nLanding attempt\n----------------\n\nOn May 3, 2020, a group of armed men, including Jordan Goudreau, landed on the coast of Venezuela in a failed attempt to oust Maduro's government. The operation was poorly planned and executed, and the team was quickly overwhelmed by the Venezuelan military.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nIndictments and arrests\n---------------------\n\nFollowing the failed operation, several people involved in the plot were arrested and indicted. Álex Alcalá, the Venezuelan ex-soldier who was extradited to the United States, was charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping and other crimes.\n\nCriminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to Alcalá, several other people involved in the operation were charged with crimes, including Jordan Goudreau and his allies. Goudreau was charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping and other crimes, and was sentenced to prison.\n\nInvestigation of interception and deaths\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe Venezuelan government launched an investigation into the deaths of several people who were involved in the operation. The investigation revealed that the Venezuelan military had intercepted and killed several members of the team.\n\nGoudreau lawsuit\n----------------\n\nIn 2020, Jordan Goudreau filed a lawsuit against the Venezuelan government, claiming that he had been betrayed by his allies and that the Venezuelan government had interfered with his operation. The lawsuit is ongoing.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\nDomestic\n--------\n\nMaduro administration\n-------------------\n\nThe Maduro administration condemned the operation and accused the Venezuelan opposition of plotting a coup. The government also accused the US government of supporting the operation.\n\nGuaidó administration and opposition\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Guaidó administration and opposition leaders condemned the operation, calling it a failed attempt to overthrow the government. Some opposition leaders also accused Goudréau of being a \"mercenaries\" and of attempting to undermine the Venezuelan opposition.\n\nNGOs\n----\n\nSeveral NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, condemned the operation and called for an investigation into the deaths and injuries caused by the Venezuelan military.\n\nInternational\n-------------\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, Brazil, and Colombia, condemned the operation and called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\n\nCharacterization\n----------------\n\nThe operation has been characterized as a failed coup attempt and a plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government. Some have also criticized the operation as a \"mercenaries\" plot, while others have accused the Venezuelan government of human rights abuses.\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\nThe operation has been the subject of several news articles, documentaries, and books. It has also been the subject of several conspiracy theories and rumors.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Venezuelan presidential crisis\n* Juan Guaidó\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Jordan Goudreau\n* Silvercorp\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by independent sources.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nJournal articles\n----------------\n\n* \"The Venezuelan Coup Attempt: A Failed Operation\" by Juan Carlos Hidalgo, Cato Institute, May 2020\n* \"The Mercenaries Who Tried to Overthrow Maduro\" by William Booth, The Washington Post, May 2020\n* \"Venezuela's Opposition and the Failed Coup\" by Brian Concannon, The New York Times, May 2020\n\nBooks\n-----\n\n* \"The Venezuelan Coup: A Study in Failure\" by Juan Carlos Hidalgo, Cato Institute, 2020\n* \"The Mercenaries: The Story of the Venezuelan Coup\" by William Booth, The Washington Post, 2020\n* \"Venezuela's Opposition: A Study in Failure\" by Brian Concannon, The New York Times, 2020\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* \"The Venezuelan Coup Attempt\" by Juan Carlos Hidalgo, Cato Institute\n* \"The Mercenaries Who Tried to Overthrow Maduro\" by William Booth, The Washington Post\n* \"Venezuela's Opposition and the Failed Coup\" by Brian Concannon, The New York Times", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Operation_Gideon_(2020)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Planning\n##Initial promotion: March–May 2019\n##Colombia Silvercorp established: June 2019\n##Negotiations with Guaidó representatives: August–November 2019\n##Alcalá and Goudreau resume preparations: December 2019\n##Extradition of Alcalá to the United States: March 2020\n###Prior knowledge of operation\n##Final preparations, Associated Press article: April–May 2020\n#Landing attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Indictments and arrests\n##Criminal charges, extradition requests and sentences\n##Investigation of interception and deaths\n##Goudreau lawsuit\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Maduro administration\n###Guaidó administration and opposition\n###NGOs\n##International\n##Characterization\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n###Journal articles\n###Books\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These ideologies have a significant presence in Serbian society, with some groups and parties achieving notable success in elections and influencing public discourse.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe far-right in Serbia is characterized by its emphasis on Serbian nationalism, often combined with authoritarianism, anti-communism, and anti-liberalism. Some groups have also been known to promote anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments, as well as a strong anti-EU and anti-NATO stance. The far-right in Serbia often draws on a mix of historical and cultural references, including the legacy of medieval Serbian Kingdoms, the Yugoslav Partisans, and the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nFar-right groups in Serbia often employ symbolism from Serbian history and culture to promote their ideology. This includes the use of the Serbian coat of arms, the national flag, and the medieval Serbian Kingdoms' symbols. Some groups also use imagery and rhetoric that draws on the legacy of the Yugoslav Partisans, the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the medieval Serbian Kingdoms. This symbolism is often used to create a sense of national identity and to promote a sense of shared values and goals.\n\n**Influence**\n\nFar-right ideologies have a significant influence on Serbian society, with some groups and parties achieving notable success in elections and influencing public discourse. Some far-right politicians have held high-ranking positions in the government, and some groups have organized large-scale protests and rallies. The far-right also has a significant presence in the media, with some outlets promoting far-right ideologies and views.\n\n**History**\n\n### Yugoslavia\n\nFar-right ideologies have a long history in Yugoslavia, dating back to the interwar period. During World War II, the Ustaše regime in Croatia was known for its extreme nationalism and anti-Serb policies.

This movement allowed for a new generation of filmmakers to produce and distribute films that were both critically acclaimed and financially successful. This article provides an overview of the background, divisions, and notable films of the Indiewood movement.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe term \"Indiewood\" was first coined in the 1990s to describe the intersection of independent filmmaking and Hollywood's commercial sensibilities. The movement was largely driven by the success of films such as Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992). These films demonstrated that it was possible to create critically acclaimed, low-budget films that could also attract a large audience and generate significant revenue.\n\nDivisions\n---------\n\nIndiewood can be divided into two main categories: Pre-Indiewood and Indiewood proper. Pre-Indiewood refers to the films and filmmakers that paved the way for the Indiewood movement, often working within the mainstream industry but pushing the boundaries of traditional Hollywood filmmaking. Indiewood proper, on the other hand, refers to the films and filmmakers that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, characterized by their independent spirit and commercial viability.\n\nOther \"mini-major\" subdivisions/indie distributors\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSeveral other independent film distributors and subdivisions have emerged within the Indiewood movement, including:\n\n* **Miramax**: Founded in 1979, Miramax was a key player in the Indiewood movement, releasing films such as Sex, Lies, and Videotape and The Crying Game.\n* **New Line Cinema**: Founded in 1967, New Line Cinema was another influential independent distributor, releasing films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Silence of the Lambs.\n* **Samuel Goldwyn Company**: Founded in 1978, Samuel Goldwyn Company was a prominent independent distributor, releasing films such as The Breakfast Club and This Boy's Life.\n\nSources\n--------\n\nThe following sources have contributed to the development of the Indiewood movement:\n\n* **Low-budget filmmaking**: The rise of low-budget filmmaking in the 1970s and 1980s allowed for a new generation of filmmakers to produce and distribute films without the need for large studio backing.\n* **Independent film festivals**: Independent film festivals such as Sundance and SXSW have provided a platform for independent filmmakers to showcase their work and attract industry attention.\n* **Indie film distribution**: The development of independent film distribution companies such as Miramax and New Line Cinema has allowed for the widespread release of independent films.\n\nDifferences from Hollywood\n-------------------------\n\nIndiewood differs from Hollywood in several key ways:\n\n* **Budget**: Indiewood films are often produced on lower budgets than Hollywood films, allowing for greater creative freedom and flexibility.\n* **Creative control**: Indiewood filmmakers often have greater creative control over their projects, allowing them to pursue more innovative and experimental storytelling.\n* **Distribution**: Indiewood films are often distributed through independent distributors, allowing for greater control over the release and marketing of the film.\n\nList of selected Indiewood/Pre-Indiewood filmmakers\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe following filmmakers have contributed to the development of the Indiewood movement:\n\n* **Steven Soderbergh**: Known for films such as Sex, Lies, and Videotape and Traffic.\n* **Quentin Tarantino**: Known for films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.\n* **Kevin Smith**: Known for films such as Clerks and Mallrats.\n* **Richard Linklater**: Known for films such as Slacker and Before Sunrise.\n* **Jim Jarmusch**: Known for films such as Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law.\n\nList of selected notable and important Pre-Indiewood films\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n### Pre-1950s\n\n* **The Gold Rush** (1925) - A silent comedy classic by Charles Chaplin.\n* **The 39 Steps** (1935) - A British thriller by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n### 1950s\n\n* **Rebel Without a Cause** (1955) - A classic teen drama by Nicholas Ray.\n* **The Seven Year Itch** (1955) - A romantic comedy by Billy Wilder.\n\n### 1960s\n\n* **Easy Rider** (1969) - A countercultural classic by Dennis Hopper.\n\n### 1970s\n\n* **Midnight Cowboy** (1969) - A drama by John Schlesinger.\n* **Chinatown** (1974) - A neo-noir by Roman Polanski.\n\nList of notable and important Indiewood films\n------------------------------------------\n\n### 1980s\n\n* **Sex, Lies, and Videotape** (1989) - A critically acclaimed drama by Steven Soderbergh.\n* **Reservoir Dogs** (1992) - A crime thriller by Quentin Tarantino.\n* **Clerks** (1994) - A low-budget comedy by Kevin Smith.\n\n### 1990s\n\n* **Pulp Fiction** (1994) - A crime thriller by Quentin Tarantino.\n* **The Big Lebowski** (1998) - A quirky comedy by the Coen brothers.\n* **Being John Malkovich** (1999) - A surreal comedy by Spike Jonze.\n\n### 2000s\n\n* **The Blair Witch Project** (1999) - A found-footage horror film by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez.\n* **Memento** (2000) - A psychological thriller by Christopher Nolan.\n* **Mulholland Drive** (2001) - A surrealist neo-noir by David Lynch.\n\n### 2010s\n\n* **The Social Network** (2010) - A biographical drama by David Fincher.\n* **The Tree of Life** (2011) - A philosophical drama by Terrence Malick.\n* **Frances Ha** (2012) - A black-and-white comedy by Noah Baumbach.\n\n### 2020s\n\n* **Parasite** (2019) - A black comedy thriller by Bong Joon-ho.\n* **The Lighthouse** (2019) - A black-and-white psychological horror film by Robert Eggers.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of the Indiewood movement, from its early days to its current state.

This conflict has been ongoing since the early 2010s, with various phases and tactics employed by Russia to achieve its objectives.\n\n**Background**\n\n**Doctrine**\n\nThe Russian doctrine of information warfare dates back to the 1990s, when the country began to develop its capabilities in the field of information operations. This doctrine emphasizes the use of information as a key component of military strategy, with the aim of disrupting the enemy's command and control systems, weakening their will to resist, and creating a favorable information environment for one's own side.\n\n**Reasons for the conflict**\n\nSeveral reasons have contributed to the escalation of the Russian information war against Ukraine. One of the primary drivers is revanchism, a desire to restore Russian influence and control over Ukraine, which was a key component of the Soviet Union.\n\n**History of the war**\n\nThe conflict between Ukraine and Russia began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. Since then, the information war has been a key component of Russia's strategy, with the aim of legitimizing its actions, undermining Ukraine's international standing, and creating divisions within Ukrainian society.\n\n**Information operations**\n\n**Censorship**\n\nRussia has employed various censorship tactics to restrict access to information in Ukraine. This includes blocking Ukrainian news outlets and social media platforms, as well as imposing strict regulations on the media. The goal of censorship is to limit the spread of information that is critical of Russia's actions and to create a favorable information environment for Russian narratives.\n\n**Telecommunications**\n\nRussia has also targeted Ukraine's telecommunications infrastructure, disrupting access to the internet and mobile phone services. This has been particularly effective in areas controlled by separatist forces, where it has allowed Russia to exert significant control over the flow of information.\n\n**Internet infrastructure**\n\nRussia has invested heavily in developing its own internet infrastructure, including the creation of the RuNet, a Russian-language internet network that is separate from the global internet. This has allowed Russia to exert greater control over the flow of information within its borders and to create a more secure and isolated online environment.\n\n**War propaganda**\n\nRussia has employed a range of propaganda tactics to shape public opinion and create a favorable information environment. This includes the use of state-controlled media outlets, such as RT (formerly Russia Today), to disseminate pro-Russian narratives and conspiracy theories.\n\n**Control of news outlets**\n\n**Public relations**\n\nRussia has also invested in developing its public relations capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions. This includes the use of social media, think tanks, and other organizations to promote Russian narratives and create a favorable information environment.\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nUkraine has also been a key focus of Russia's information operations, with the aim of undermining the Ukrainian government's legitimacy and creating divisions within Ukrainian society. This has included the use of propaganda, disinformation, and other tactics to create a sense of uncertainty and instability.\n\n**Russia**\n\n**RT**\n\nRT (formerly Russia Today) is a state-controlled media outlet that has been a key component of Russia's information operations. The channel has been accused of promoting pro-Russian narratives and conspiracy theories, and of spreading disinformation about Ukraine and other countries.\n\n**Russian interference with Ukrainian media**\n\nRussia has also interfered with Ukrainian media outlets, using a range of tactics to restrict access to information and create a favorable information environment. This has included the use of propaganda, disinformation, and other tactics to create a sense of uncertainty and instability.\n\n**Methods and resources**\n\n**Disinformation**\n\nRussia has employed a range of disinformation tactics to create a favorable information environment. This includes the use of falsehoods and adamant denials to create confusion and uncertainty.\n\n**Falsehoods and adamant denials**\n\nRussia has been accused of spreading falsehoods and adamant denials about various topics, including the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n**2014**\n\nIn 2014, Russia spread a range of disinformation about Ukraine, including claims that the Ukrainian government was planning to suppress the Russian-speaking population.\n\n**Malaysia Airlines Flight 17**\n\nIn 2014, Russia spread a range of disinformation about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, including claims that the Ukrainian military was responsible for the attack.\n\n**2022**\n\nIn 2022, Russia spread a range of disinformation about the conflict in Ukraine, including claims that the Ukrainian government was planning to use chemical weapons against Russian-speaking civilians.\n\n**Tropes**\n\nRussia has employed a range of tropes to create a favorable information environment. This includes the use of conspiracy theories, anti-Western narratives, and other tactics to create a sense of uncertainty and instability.\n\n**Social media**\n\n**Access to social media**\n\nRussia has invested heavily in developing its social media capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n**Attempts to censor Russian Wikipedia**\n\nRussia has also attempted to censor Russian Wikipedia, with the aim of restricting access to information and creating a favorable information environment.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n**2014**\n\n### January\n\n* Russia begins to spread disinformation about Ukraine, including claims that the Ukrainian government is planning to suppress the Russian-speaking population.\n\n### February\n\n* Russia annexes Crimea, sparking a crisis in Ukraine.\n\n### March\n\n* Russia supports separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, leading to the outbreak of conflict.\n\n### April\n\n* Russia spreads disinformation about the conflict, including claims that the Ukrainian military is responsible for civilian casualties.\n\n### May\n\n* Russia invests in developing its social media capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n### June\n\n* Russia creates the RuNet, a Russian-language internet network that is separate from the global internet.\n\n### July–August\n\n* Russia continues to support separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, leading to a further escalation of the conflict.\n\n### October\n\n* Russia spreads disinformation about the conflict, including claims that the Ukrainian government is planning to use chemical weapons against Russian-speaking civilians.\n\n### December\n\n* Russia continues to invest in developing its information operations capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n**2015**\n\n### January\n\n* Russia continues to support separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, leading to a further escalation of the conflict.\n\n### February\n\n* Russia spreads disinformation about the conflict, including claims that the Ukrainian military is responsible for civilian casualties.\n\n### March\n\n* Russia invests in developing its public relations capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n### June\n\n* Russia creates a range of think tanks and other organizations to promote Russian narratives and create a favorable information environment.\n\n**2016**\n\n* Russia continues to invest in developing its information operations capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n**2017**\n\n* Russia spreads disinformation about the conflict in Ukraine, including claims that the Ukrainian government is planning to use chemical weapons against Russian-speaking civilians.\n\n**2018**\n\n* Russia invests in developing its social media capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n**2019**\n\n* Russia continues to support separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, leading to a further escalation of the conflict.\n\n**2021**\n\n* Russia spreads disinformation about the conflict in Ukraine, including claims that the Ukrainian government is planning to use chemical weapons against Russian-speaking civilians.\n\n**2022**\n\n### January\n\n* Russia launches a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sparking a major crisis in the region.\n\n### February\n\n* Russia spreads disinformation about the conflict, including claims that the Ukrainian military is responsible for civilian casualties.\n\n### March\n\n* Russia continues to invest in developing its information operations capabilities, with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing international perceptions of its actions.\n\n**Staged videos**\n\nRussia has also employed the use of staged videos to create a favorable information environment.

From ancient myths and legends to modern-day epic fantasies, the genre has evolved over time, influenced by various cultural and literary movements. This article will explore the differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works, the development of fantasy as a distinct genre, and its modern forms.\n\nDifferences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n\nWhile fantasy has its roots in mythology and folklore, it is distinct from earlier forms of storytelling in several ways. Unlike mythological tales, which often had a basis in historical or cultural fact, fantasy stories typically involve supernatural or magical elements that are not grounded in reality. Additionally, fantasy often involves a sense of wonder and enchantment, which is not always present in mythological tales.\n\nOne key difference between fantasy and earlier fantastic works is the level of realism. Mythological tales often sought to explain natural phenomena or historical events, whereas fantasy stories often involve impossible or supernatural events that are not meant to be taken literally. This shift in tone and purpose helped to establish fantasy as a distinct genre.\n\nAnother difference between fantasy and earlier fantastic works is the level of emotional involvement. Fantasy stories often involve a strong emotional connection with the reader, whereas mythological tales were often meant to be instructional or cautionary. This emotional connection is a hallmark of fantasy, and has been used to great effect in many classic works of the genre.\n\nDevelopment of fantasy\n\nThe development of fantasy as a distinct genre has been shaped by several key literary movements.\n\n### Romances\n\nThe romance genre, which emerged in the 12th century, was a major influence on the development of fantasy. Romances often involved chivalric adventures, magical creatures, and supernatural events, all of which were hallmarks of the fantasy genre. Works such as Chrétien de Troyes' Arthurian romances and Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron helped to establish the romance genre as a precursor to modern fantasy.\n\nRomances often featured magical and supernatural elements, which were typically used to explain natural phenomena or to create a sense of wonder and enchantment. These elements were often used to comment on social and cultural issues, and to explore the human condition. Romances helped to establish the fantasy genre's focus on the emotional and the irrational, which would become a hallmark of the genre.\n\n### The Enlightenment\n\nThe Enlightenment, which emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries, saw a shift away from the magical and supernatural elements of romance. Works such as John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding and David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding helped to establish the idea that the world could be understood through reason and observation. This shift in emphasis helped to establish the rational and the scientific as the dominant modes of inquiry.\n\nHowever, the Enlightenment also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the Gothic fiction of Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis. These works often featured supernatural and magical elements, but were presented in a more scientific and rational light. This helped to establish the idea that fantasy could be used to explore the mysteries of the human psyche, rather than simply to explain natural phenomena.\n\n### Romanticism\n\nThe Romantic movement, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, saw a renewed interest in the magical and supernatural elements of romance. Works such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and John Keats' \"Ode to a Nightingale\" helped to establish the idea that fantasy could be used to explore the human condition, and to comment on social and cultural issues.\n\nRomanticism also saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the fairy tale and the mythology. Works such as the Brothers Grimm's Kinder- und Hausmärchen and Thomas Bulfinch's The Age of Fable helped to establish the idea that fantasy could be used to explore the collective unconscious, and to comment on universal human experiences.\n\nModern fantasy\n\nModern fantasy has evolved significantly since the emergence of the fantasy genre in the 19th century. The following sections will explore the development of fantasy in the 20th century, and its current forms.\n\n### Pre-Tolkien\n\nPrior to the emergence of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-55), fantasy was often associated with children's literature and pulp fiction. Works such as L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars series (1912-1943) helped to establish the idea that fantasy could be used to create thrilling and adventurous stories for a young adult audience.\n\nHowever, these works were often criticized for their simplicity and lack of depth. They were seen as mere entertainment, rather than as serious literature. This helped to establish the idea that fantasy was a lesser form of literature, and that it was not suitable for serious consideration.\n\n### Tolkien\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings helped to establish fantasy as a serious and respected genre. Tolkien's works were praised for their depth, complexity, and world-building, and they helped to establish the idea that fantasy could be used to explore complex themes and ideas.\n\nTolkien's influence can be seen in many subsequent works of fantasy, including C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia and Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle. These works helped to establish fantasy as a major genre, and they paved the way for the development of modern fantasy.\n\n### Post-Tolkien\n\nSince the emergence of Tolkien's works, fantasy has continued to evolve and diversify. The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of new forms of fantasy, such as the urban fantasy of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and Gray Mouser series and the epic fantasy of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of new sub-genres, such as the dark fantasy of Clive Barker's Hellraiser series and the urban fantasy of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series. These works helped to establish fantasy as a major genre, and they paved the way for the development of modern fantasy.\n\nReferences\n\n* \"The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature\".

This concept can be applied in different ways, depending on the sport and its rules. In this article, we will discuss the sports that allow free substitution, as well as those with limited or hybrid substitution systems.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFree substitution is a tactical approach used by coaches to gain a strategic advantage over their opponents. By replacing players during a game, teams can change the dynamics of the match, exploit weaknesses in the opposing team's defense, or conserve energy for key moments. The rules governing substitution vary significantly across different sports, leading to a range of strategies and approaches.\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n\nSome sports permit teams to make unlimited substitutions during live play, allowing for frequent changes to the lineup. This can be seen in:\n\n- **Floorball:** In floorball, teams can make substitutions at any time during the game, as long as the ball is not in play.\n- **Futsal:** Similar to floorball, futsal allows teams to make unlimited substitutions during live play, enabling coaches to make tactical changes on the fly.\n- **Water polo:** In water polo, teams can replace players during live play, but only when the ball is out of bounds.\n- **Beach soccer:** Beach soccer, also known as beach football, features unlimited substitutions during live play, allowing teams to adapt their strategy as needed.\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n\nSeveral sports permit teams to make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as timeouts, injury timeouts, or halftime breaks. This can be seen in:\n\n- **Basketball:** In basketball, teams can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play, including timeouts and halftime breaks.\n- **American football:** American football teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as timeouts, quarter breaks, and halftime.\n- **Hockey:** In ice hockey, teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play, including timeouts, intermissions, and between periods.\n- **Rugby:** Rugby teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as timeouts, halftime breaks, and between quarters.\n\n## Sports with limited substitution\n\nSome sports have restrictions on the number of substitutions that can be made during a game. This can be seen in:\n\n- **Soccer:** In soccer, teams are limited to three substitutions per game, with some exceptions for injuries or medical emergencies.\n- **Tennis:** Tennis matches have no substitutions, but players can change their equipment or receive medical attention during breaks in play.\n- **Golf:** Golf tournaments have no substitutions, but players can receive medical attention or equipment changes during breaks in play.\n- **Cricket:** Cricket teams are limited to two substitutions per innings, with some exceptions for injuries or medical emergencies.\n\n## Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n\nA few sports only permit substitutions to replace injured players, rather than for tactical reasons. This can be seen in:\n\n- **Boxing:** In boxing, fighters can only substitute for injured opponents, rather than for tactical reasons.\n- **Mixed martial arts:** Similar to boxing, mixed martial arts fighters can only substitute for injured opponents.\n- **Wrestling:** In some forms of wrestling, such as amateur wrestling, substitutions are only permitted to replace injured players.\n\n## Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n\nSome sports have a combination of unlimited substitutions, limited substitutions, or restrictions on when substitutions can be made. This can be seen in:\n\n- **Lacrosse:** In lacrosse, teams are limited to four substitutions per game, but can make substitutions during stoppages in play.\n- **Field hockey:** Field hockey teams are limited to four substitutions per game, but can make substitutions during stoppages in play.\n- **Rugby sevens:** Rugby sevens teams are limited to replacement players during stoppages in play, but can make unlimited substitutions during live play.\n\n## See also\n\n- **Tactical substitution**\n- **Sport strategy**\n- **Coaching techniques**\n- **Player management**\n\n## Notes\n\nFree substitution is a complex and nuanced topic, with various rules and regulations governing its application across different sports. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the sports that allow free substitution, as well as those with limited or hybrid substitution systems.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike was the result of a dispute between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) over issues such as fair compensation, residuals, and workers' rights.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Unionization in Hollywood\n\nSAG-AFTRA is a labor union that represents over 160,000 film and television actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, DJs, news writers, news editors, program hosts, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, and other media professionals in the United States and Canada. The union was formed in 2012 through the merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA).\n\nSAG-AFTRA has a long history of advocating for the rights of its members in the entertainment industry. The union has negotiated contracts with producers and studios that provide fair compensation, residuals, and benefits for its members. However, the industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, including the rise of streaming services and the increasing use of artificial intelligence and automation. These changes have led to concerns among SAG-AFTRA members about their jobs, salaries, and working conditions.\n\n### Pre-strike activity\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA members expressed growing frustration with the AMPTP over issues such as fair compensation, residuals, and workers' rights. The union had been in negotiations with the AMPTP since 2022, but the talks had stalled. In June 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to authorize a strike, which led to a series of protests and demonstrations outside studios and streaming services.\n\nThe pre-strike activity was marked by a growing sense of urgency and frustration among SAG-AFTRA members. Many members felt that the union had not done enough to protect their interests and that the AMPTP was not willing to negotiate in good faith. The protests and demonstrations were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### July\n\nThe strike began on July 14, 2023, when SAG-AFTRA members walked off the job in protest of the AMPTP's proposed contract. The strike was called after months of negotiations between the two sides had broken down.\n\nThe first few days of the strike saw clashes between protesters and security guards outside studios and streaming services. The protests were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\nOn July 17, 2023, the AMPTP made a public statement saying that they were willing to negotiate with SAG-AFTRA, but that they would not budge on issues such as compensation and residuals. The statement was seen as a attempt to pressure SAG-AFTRA to return to the negotiating table.\n\n### August\n\nIn August 2023, the strike continued, with protests and demonstrations taking place outside studios and streaming services. The protests were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\nOn August 10, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to ratify a new contract with the AMPTP. The contract included significant gains for SAG-AFTRA members, including increased compensation, residuals, and benefits.\n\nHowever, the contract was not without controversy. Some SAG-AFTRA members felt that the contract did not go far enough in addressing issues such as workers' rights and fair compensation. The contract also included provisions that allowed for the use of artificial intelligence and automation on film and television sets.\n\n### September\n\nIn September 2023, the strike continued, with protests and demonstrations taking place outside studios and streaming services. The protests were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, the AMPTP made a public statement saying that they were willing to meet with SAG-AFTRA to discuss the use of artificial intelligence and automation on film and television sets. The statement was seen as a attempt to address concerns among SAG-AFTRA members about the impact of technology on their jobs.\n\n### October\n\nIn October 2023, the strike continued, with protests and demonstrations taking place outside studios and streaming services. The protests were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\nOn October 20, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to extend the strike for another month. The vote was seen as a sign of solidarity among SAG-AFTRA members, who were determined to see the strike through to its conclusion.\n\n### November\n\nIn November 2023, the strike continued, with protests and demonstrations taking place outside studios and streaming services. The protests were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the AMPTP made a public statement saying that they were willing to meet with SAG-AFTRA to discuss the use of artificial intelligence and automation on film and television sets. The statement was seen as a attempt to address concerns among SAG-AFTRA members about the impact of technology on their jobs.\n\n### December\n\nIn December 2023, the strike continued, with protests and demonstrations taking place outside studios and streaming services. The protests were largely peaceful, but they disrupted production on several film and television sets.\n\nOn December 20, 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted to ratify a new contract with the AMPTP. The contract included significant gains for SAG-AFTRA members, including increased compensation, residuals, and benefits.\n\nHowever, the contract was not without controversy.

The film is a dark reimagining of the classic Winnie-the-Pooh children's stories, and it has generated significant controversy and debate among fans of the original material.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the Hundred Acre Wood, where the traditional characters of Winnie-the-Pooh are reimagined as violent and menacing figures. The story follows Winnie-the-Pooh, a large and menacing bear, as he terrorizes the Wood and causes chaos and destruction. Eeyore, the donkey, is portrayed as a traumatized and disturbing character, while Piglet is depicted as a small and terrified creature. Tigger, the bouncy tiger, is shown to be a sadistic and violent character who takes pleasure in causing pain and suffering.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the characters are not what they seem. Winnie-the-Pooh is not a lovable and friendly bear, but a ruthless and bloodthirsty creature who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Eeyore is not a depressed and melancholy donkey, but a twisted and sadistic character who takes pleasure in causing suffering. Piglet is not a small and timid creature, but a terrified and traumatized individual who is constantly on the run from the other characters.\n\nThe film's plot is a commentary on the darker aspects of human nature and the way that people can be driven to violence and cruelty by their own desires and impulses. It is a critique of the traditional children's story, which often portrays the characters as innocent and harmless. The film's use of horror and violence is meant to shock and disturb the audience, and to challenge their assumptions about the characters and their motivations.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features the voice talents of:\n\n* Sam Cooney as Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Simon Fenton as Eeyore\n* Daniel Fathers as Piglet\n* Scott Reid as Tigger\n* Erin Robinson as Kanga\n* Jeremy Kasten as Christopher Robin\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was developed by Rob Longstreth, a British animator and filmmaker. Longstreth was inspired by the classic Winnie-the-Pooh stories, but he wanted to create a darker and more sinister version of the characters. He was influenced by the works of horror filmmakers such as David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick, and he wanted to create a film that would challenge the audience and push the boundaries of what is acceptable.\n\nLongstreth spent several years developing the film, working on the script and the animation. He was determined to create a film that would be a true horror classic, and he was willing to take risks and push the boundaries of what is acceptable in order to achieve his goal.\n\n### Filming\n\nThe film was animated using a combination of traditional and computer-generated imagery. The animation was done by a team of artists and technicians who worked tirelessly to bring the characters and the world of the Hundred Acre Wood to life.\n\nThe filming process was a long and difficult one, with many challenges and obstacles to overcome. The team had to work closely together to ensure that the animation was of the highest quality, and that the film met the director's vision.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by a team of musicians and composers. The music was inspired by the classic Winnie-the-Pooh theme song, but it was also influenced by horror and suspense music. The soundtrack is a key element of the film, and it helps to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\nThe music is used to great effect in several key scenes, including the opening sequence, where Winnie-the-Pooh is shown terrorizing the Wood. The music is also used to create a sense of irony and humor, as the characters are shown to be more sinister than they initially appear.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film was marketed as a horror film, and it was promoted as a dark and sinister reimagining of the classic Winnie-the-Pooh stories. The marketing campaign was designed to generate buzz and excitement, and to attract a audience that was looking for a unique and challenging horror film.\n\nThe trailer for the film was released several months before the film's release date, and it quickly went viral on social media. The trailer showed the characters of Winnie-the-Pooh and Eeyore in a dark and sinister light, and it hinted at the film's themes of violence and cruelty.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media several months after its theatrical release. The DVD and Blu-ray editions of the film include a range of special features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a commentary track with the director and cast.\n\nThe home media release of the film was a commercial success, and it helped to generate further buzz and excitement about the film.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was a commercial success, and it grossed over $10 million at the box office. The film's success was a surprise to many, as it was a relatively low-budget film and it was not expected to do well.\n\nThe film's box office success was due in part to its unique and challenging subject matter, as well as its horror and suspense elements. The film appealed to a audience that was looking for a unique and exciting horror film, and it helped to generate buzz and excitement about the film.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its unique and challenging subject matter, while others criticized its graphic violence and gore. The film's use of horror and suspense elements was widely praised, as was the performances of the cast.\n\nHowever, some critics criticized the film's pacing and editing, as well as its lack of character development. The film's themes of violence and cruelty were also criticized by some, who felt that they were not handled in a sensitive or nuanced way.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film and a Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Wide Release Film. The film's director, Rob Longstreth, was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Director.\n\n**Future**\n\n### Sequel\n\nThere have been rumors of a sequel to the film, which would continue the story of Winnie-the-Pooh and the other characters. However, nothing has been officially announced, and it is unclear whether the sequel would be a horror film or a more family-friendly adventure.\n\n### Shared universe and other projects\n\nThere have been rumors of a shared universe for the Winnie-the-Pooh characters, which would include a range of films and TV shows that would explore different aspects of the characters and their world. However, nothing has been officially announced, and it is unclear whether this would be a reality.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Eeyore\n* Piglet\n* Tigger\n* Christopher Robin\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references, as they are not available.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey at IMDb\n* Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Winnie-the-Pooh:_Blood_and_Honey\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n##Sequel\n##Shared universe and other projects\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He has written extensively on the subject of government secrecy and the use of anonymous sources in investigative journalism.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nBorn on April 8, 1927, in Chicago, Illinois, Hersh grew up in a Jewish family and attended South Shore High School in Chicago. After serving in the United States Army from 1944 to 1947, Hersh attended the University of Chicago, where he studied sociology and philosophy. He later transferred to the University of Minnesota, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950.\n\n**Newspaper career**\n\nHersh began his career in journalism in the 1950s, working for the _Minneapolis Tribune_ and later the _Chicago Sun-Times_. In 1962, he joined the _New York Times_ as a reporter, covering the Pentagon and the military. During his time at the _Times_, Hersh became known for his aggressive and in-depth reporting on military affairs.\n\n### My Lai massacre\n\nOne of Hersh's most notable stories was his expose on the My Lai massacre, a mass killing of Vietnamese civilians by American soldiers in March 1968. Hersh's reporting on the incident, which was based on anonymous sources, was initially dismissed by the military and the _New York Times_. However, after a subsequent investigation by the military, it was confirmed that the massacre had taken place. Hersh's reporting on the incident was a major turning point in the Vietnam War, and it led to widespread outrage and calls for greater accountability from the military.\n\n### The New York Times\n\nHersh's reporting on the My Lai massacre was a major factor in his departure from the _New York Times_ in 1970. He went on to work for _New Times_, a magazine that was known for its investigative reporting. Hersh's work at _New Times_ included a series of exposés on government and military wrongdoing, including the use of napalm in Vietnam and the CIA's involvement in the assassination of Chilean President Salvador Allende.\n\n**Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s**\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh wrote a series of investigative books that exposed government and military wrongdoing. These books included:\n\n* _Reporter_ (1972), a memoir of his time at the _New York Times_\n* _My Lai 4: A Report on the Massacre and Its Aftermath_ (1970), a detailed account of the My Lai massacre\n* _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983), an exposé of Henry Kissinger's role in the Nixon administration\n* _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy_ (1991), a book on Israel's nuclear program and its implications for American foreign policy\n\n**Later investigations**\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Hersh continued to write investigative articles and books on government and military wrongdoing. Some of his notable investigations from this period include:\n\n### Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n\nIn 2004, Hersh reported on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, a story that was based on anonymous sources and initially denied by the military. His reporting on the incident led to widespread outrage and calls for greater accountability from the military.\n\n### Iran\n\nIn 2008, Hersh reported on the existence of a secret CIA program to sabotage Iran's nuclear program, a story that was based on anonymous sources. His reporting on the incident led to widespread debate and speculation about the nature of the program.\n\n### Syria and chemical attacks\n\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the possibility that the Syrian government was not responsible for a chemical attack in Ghouta, a story that was based on anonymous sources. His reporting on the incident led to widespread debate and speculation about the nature of the attack.\n\n### Killing of Osama bin Laden\n\nIn 2015, Hersh reported on the killing of Osama bin Laden, a story that was based on anonymous sources. His reporting on the incident led to widespread debate and speculation about the nature of the operation.\n\n### Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Hersh reported on the possibility that the Biden administration was responsible for a sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, a story that was based on anonymous sources. His reporting on the incident led to widespread debate and speculation about the nature of the operation.\n\n**Other statements**\n\nHersh has made a number of other statements and given a number of speeches throughout his career. Some of these include:\n\n### Speeches\n\nHersh has given a number of speeches on the topic of investigative journalism and the use of anonymous sources. He has also spoken on the topic of government and military wrongdoing, and the need for greater accountability.\n\n### Murder of Seth Rich\n\nIn 2017, Hersh reported on the possibility that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, was murdered by a right-wing extremist. His reporting on the incident led to widespread debate and speculation about the nature of the murder.\n\n### Pat Nixon abuse\n\nIn 2020, Hersh reported on the possibility that Pat Nixon, the wife of Richard Nixon, was physically and emotionally abused by her husband. His reporting on the incident led to widespread debate and speculation about the nature of their marriage.\n\n**Use of anonymous sources**\n\nHersh has been a strong advocate for the use of anonymous sources in investigative journalism. He has written extensively on the topic, and has argued that the use of anonymous sources is a necessary tool for exposing government and military wrongdoing.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nHersh has been married three times and has two children. He is a longtime resident of Washington, D.C. and has been a vocal critic of the city's real estate market.\n\n**Awards and honors**\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including:\n\n* Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting (1970)\n* George Polk Award for Investigative Reporting (1970)\n* George Polk Award for Non- Fiction Book (1992)\n* National Magazine Award for Public Interest (1996)\n\n**Publications**\n\nHersh has written a number of books and articles throughout his career.

He is also notorious for his alleged involvement in occult practices and child murders, which led to his trial and execution. This article will provide an in-depth examination of his life, military career, and the events that led to his downfall.\n\n## House of Retz\n\n### Early Life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in Champtocé, Maine, as the younger brother of Jean de Rais, a prominent nobleman in the region. His family, the House of Retz, was a powerful aristocratic family in western France. Gilles's early life was marked by a close relationship with his older brother, who would later play a significant role in his life.\n\n### Matrimonial Projects\n\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais married Catherine de Thouars, a member of a noble family in Brittany. The marriage was arranged by his family, with the intention of securing an alliance with the powerful House of Thouars. However, the marriage was short-lived, and Catherine died shortly after giving birth to their daughter, Marie de Rais.\n\n### Family Disputes\n\nGilles de Rais's relationship with his family, particularly his brother Jean, was strained. Jean was a powerful and influential nobleman, who controlled a significant portion of the family's wealth and estates. Gilles felt overshadowed by his brother and sought to establish his own identity and reputation.\n\n### Titles, Estates, and Wealth\n\nAs a member of the House of Retz, Gilles de Rais inherited a significant portion of his family's wealth and estates. He was granted the title of Count of Montauban and received control of several castles and territories in western France. His wealth and titles made him a prominent figure in the region.\n\n## Military Career\n\n### First Hypothetical Feat of Arms\n\nGilles de Rais's military career began during the Hundred Years' War, when he participated in a hypothetical feat of arms against the English garrisons in the region of Maine. Although the exact details of this event are unclear, it is believed to have taken place around 1420.\n\n### Franco-Breton Alliance through the House of Valois-Anjou\n\nIn 1425, Gilles de Rais formed an alliance with the House of Valois-Anjou, a powerful noble family in France. This alliance allowed him to secure significant military support and financial backing, which he used to expand his territorial control.\n\n### Guerilla Warfare against English Garrisons on the Borders of Maine\n\nGilles de Rais led a series of guerrilla warfare campaigns against English garrisons on the borders of Maine. These campaigns were successful, and he was able to secure several key victories against the English.\n\n### Companion in Arms with Joan of Arc\n\nIn 1429, Gilles de Rais became a companion in arms to Joan of Arc, who was leading a military campaign to liberate Orleans from English control. Gilles de Rais played a significant role in the campaign, providing military support and guidance to Joan.\n\n### Civil Wars between La Trémoille and Richemont's Allies\n\nIn the early 1430s, Gilles de Rais became embroiled in a series of civil wars between the houses of La Trémoille and Richemont. These wars were fought over control of territory and wealth, and Gilles de Rais eventually aligned himself with the House of La Trémoille.\n\n### Lifting of the Siege of Lagny\n\nIn 1433, Gilles de Rais led a successful campaign to lift the siege of Lagny, a strategic town in eastern France. This victory was significant, as it allowed the French to regain control of the region.\n\n### Reduction of Military Commitments\n\nIn the mid-1430s, Gilles de Rais began to reduce his military commitments, focusing more on his personal interests and wealth. This decision was likely driven by a desire to avoid further conflict and preserve his resources.\n\n## Squandering of Heritage\n\nGilles de Rais's decision to reduce his military commitments was also driven by a desire to squander his heritage. He spent lavishly on castles, art, and other luxuries, often using his wealth to impress his contemporaries.\n\n## Criminal Life\n\n### Occult Involvement\n\nGilles de Rais became increasingly involved in occult practices, including divination and demonology. This involvement was likely driven by a desire for power and knowledge.\n\n### Child Murders\n\nGilles de Rais was accused of committing a series of child murders, allegedly using the victims for occult rituals. The exact nature and extent of these crimes are unclear, but they were a major factor in his eventual trial and execution.\n\n### Act of Force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nIn 1440, Gilles de Rais was accused of using force against a group of children in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte. This event was likely linked to his alleged child murders and occult involvement.\n\n### Ecclesiastical and Secular Investigations\n\nGilles de Rais faced a series of investigations by both ecclesiastical and secular authorities. These investigations were likely driven by a desire to uncover the truth behind his alleged crimes.\n\n### Trial and Execution\n\nGilles de Rais was put on trial for his alleged crimes, and was eventually found guilty. He was executed by burning at the stake in 1440.\n\n## Question of Guilt\n\n### Doubts about the Verdict in the Age of Enlightenment Tradition\n\nIn the 18th century, the concept of the Age of Enlightenment emerged, which emphasized reason and skepticism. Many scholars began to question the verdict against Gilles de Rais, arguing that the evidence against him was circumstantial and unreliable.\n\n### Occultist Interpretations\n\nSome scholars have argued that Gilles de Rais's alleged crimes were linked to his involvement in occult practices. This interpretation suggests that his actions were driven by a desire for power and knowledge.\n\n### Georges Bataille's Interpretations\n\nGeorges Bataille, a French philosopher and writer, interpreted Gilles de Rais's crimes as a manifestation of the excesses of the aristocracy. According to Bataille, Gilles de Rais's actions were driven by a desire to assert his power and status.\n\n### 1992 Mock Re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of Gilles de Rais was held in France. The trial was a re-enactment of the original trial, and was intended to examine the evidence against him in a modern context.\n\n### Contemporary Academic Views\n\nContemporary scholars continue to debate the question of Gilles de Rais's guilt. While some argue that he was a serial killer, others argue that the evidence against him is circumstantial and unreliable.\n\n## Fictional Portraits\n\nGilles de Rais has been the subject of numerous fictional portraits, including novels, plays, and films. These works often explore his alleged crimes and his relationship with Joan of Arc.\n\n## Psychopathological Interpretations\n\nSome scholars have interpreted Gilles de Rais's behavior as indicative of psychopathy. According to this interpretation, his actions were driven by a lack of empathy and a desire for power and control.\n\n## Fin de Siècle Portrayals\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Gilles de Rais became a popular figure in literature and art. His alleged crimes and his relationship with Joan of Arc were often portrayed in romantic and sensationalized terms.\n\n## Classification as a Serial Killer\n\nGilles de Rais is widely regarded as one of the first modern serial killers. His alleged crimes, including the murder of children, are often cited as evidence of his psychopathic behavior.\n\n## Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard Myth\n\nGilles de Rais's alleged crimes have been linked to the myth of Bluebeard, a figure from French folklore who murders his wives. According to this interpretation, Gilles de Rais's actions were driven by a desire for power and control.\n\n## Relationship with Joan of Arc\n\nGilles de Rais's relationship with Joan of Arc is a subject of ongoing debate among scholars. While some argue that he was a devoted follower of Joan, others argue that he was motivated by self-interest.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Joan of Arc\n* House of Retz\n* Hundred Years' War\n* Occultism\n\n## References\n\n### Notes\n\n* The exact dates of Gilles de Rais's life are not known with certainty.\n* The nature and extent of his alleged crimes are unclear and subject to debate.\n* The historical record of Gilles de Rais's life and crimes is often fragmented and unreliable.\n\n### Footnotes\n\n* 1.

The election took place on January 3–7, 2023, as a result of the 118th Congress convening. This election was notable for being the longest Speaker election in U.S. history, with multiple ballots held over the course of several days.\n\n#Process and conventions\nThe Speaker of the House is the presiding officer of the House of Representatives, second in line to the presidency, and the leader of the majority party in the House. The Speaker is elected by a majority vote of the members present. In the event that a Speaker is not elected on the first ballot, subsequent ballots are held until a Speaker is chosen.\n\n#Democratic nomination\nThe Democratic Party nomination for Speaker was initially seen as a foregone conclusion, with Hakeem Jeffries being the presumptive nominee. However, due to a narrow margin of control in the House and the desire to give more representation to diverse voices within the party, Jeffries decided to hold off on formally announcing his candidacy.\n\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\nHakeem Jeffries, a member from New York's 8th congressional district, had been seen as the front-runner for the Speaker's gavel. He had been a key figure in the party's leadership and had served as the chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\n###Declined to run\nOther notable Democrats who were considered potential candidates for Speaker included Jim Clyburn, Katherine Clark, and Adam Schiff. However, all of these individuals ultimately decided not to run for the position.\n\n##Result\nOn January 3, 2023, Hakeem Jeffries officially announced his candidacy for Speaker, and he went on to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n#Republican nomination\nThe Republican Party nomination for Speaker was seen as a competition between several prominent members of the party.\n\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\nKevin McCarthy, a member from California's 20th congressional district, had been the leader of the House Republicans since 2019. He had been a key figure in the party's leadership and had served as the minority leader of the House.\n\n###Lost nomination\nOther notable Republicans who were considered potential candidates for Speaker included Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, and Elise Stefanik. However, only Kevin McCarthy officially announced his candidacy.\n\n##Results\nOn January 3, 2023, Kevin McCarthy announced his candidacy for Speaker and initially won the Republican nomination.\n\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\nThe Speaker election took place on January 3–7, 2023, as a result of the 118th Congress convening. The election was notable for being the longest Speaker election in U.S. history, with multiple ballots held over the course of several days.\n\n##Candidates\nMultiple candidates were considered for the position of Speaker, including Hakeem Jeffries, Kevin McCarthy, and several others.\n\n##Summary\nOn the first day of the Speaker election, January 3, 2023, Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy both announced their candidacy for Speaker. However, neither candidate was able to secure a majority of the votes, and subsequent ballots were held. On January 4, 2023, the vote count remained unchanged, with Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy continuing to lead the two main factions. On January 5, 2023, the vote count stabilized, with Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy securing significant support from their respective parties. However, it was not until January 7, 2023, that Hakeem Jeffries secured the support of the necessary number of votes to win the election.\n\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\nOn the first day of the Speaker election, January 3, 2023, Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy both announced their candidacy for Speaker. However, neither candidate was able to secure a majority of the votes, and subsequent ballots were held.\n\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\nOn January 4, 2023, the vote count remained unchanged, with Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy continuing to lead the two main factions.\n\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\nOn January 5, 2023, the vote count stabilized, with Hakeem Jeffries and Kevin McCarthy securing significant support from their respective parties.\n\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\nHowever, it was not until January 7, 2023, that Hakeem Jeffries secured the support of the necessary number of votes to win the election.\n\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\nOn January 7, 2023, Hakeem Jeffries secured the support of the necessary number of votes to win the election, with 212 votes in favor of his nomination.\n\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n| Ballot | Hakeem Jeffries | Kevin McCarthy | Other Candidates | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 212 | 203 | 20 | 435 |\n| 2 | 212 | 203 | 20 | 435 |\n| 3 | 212 | 203 | 20 | 435 |\n| 4 | 212 | 203 | 20 | 435 |\n| 5 | 212 | 203 | 20 | 435 |\n| 6 | 212 | 203 | 20 | 435 |\n| 7 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 8 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 9 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 10 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 11 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 12 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 13 | 213 | 202 | 20 | 435 |\n| 14 | 214 | 201 | 20 | 435 |\n| 15 | 214 | 201 | 20 | 435 |\n\n#Impact\n##Historical context\nThe Speaker election was notable for being the longest Speaker election in U.S. history, with multiple ballots held over the course of several days.\n\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\nThe absence of a Speaker led to a series of consequences, including the inability to conduct business on the House floor, the inability to pass legislation, and the inability to conduct routine business.\n\n##C-SPAN popularity\nThe Speaker election was widely covered by C-SPAN, with the channel broadcasting the proceedings live and providing extensive coverage of the election.\n\n#See also\nThis article is related to the election of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.\n\n#Notes\nThis article does not include any notes or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"January_2023_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Process and conventions\n#Democratic nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Declined to run\n##Result\n#Republican nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Lost nomination\n##Results\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\n##Candidates\n##Summary\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n#Impact\n##Historical context\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\n##C-SPAN popularity\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This era saw a resurgence of classical Greek and Roman forms, as well as the development of new styles and techniques. Italian Renaissance sculpture is characterized by its use of naturalistic and realistic depictions of the human form, as well as its emphasis on emotion, movement, and drama.\n\n# Periods\n\nThe history of Italian Renaissance sculpture can be divided into several distinct periods, each marked by significant developments and innovations.\n\n## To 1400\n\nDuring the early 14th century, Italian sculpture was heavily influenced by the Gothic style, which emphasized vertical lines, pointed arches, and ornate decoration. However, as the Renaissance took hold, artists began to look back to classical Greek and Roman models for inspiration. The works of artists such as Arnolfo di Cambio and Andrea Pisano show a growing interest in classical forms and a desire to create more naturalistic and realistic depictions of the human body.\n\n## From 1400\n\nThe 15th century saw a significant shift in Italian sculpture, as artists began to focus on creating more naturalistic and realistic works. This was influenced by the development of perspective, which allowed artists to create the illusion of depth and space on a flat surface. Artists such as Donatello and Brunelleschi were among the first to use perspective in their works, creating a sense of movement and drama.\n\n## Doors of the Florence Baptistery\n\nOne of the most famous examples of early Renaissance sculpture is the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, created by Andrea Pisano in the early 14th century. These doors are notable for their use of classical forms and their emphasis on naturalistic depictions of the human body. They are also significant for their use of perspective, which creates a sense of depth and space.\n\n## Donatello\n\nDonatello was one of the most influential artists of the 15th century, and his works are characterized by their naturalism and realism. His sculptures often depicted everyday people and scenes, instead of the idealized figures of classical art. Donatello's use of perspective and his emphasis on movement and drama helped to create a sense of tension and emotion in his works.\n\n## Middle of the century\n\nDuring the middle of the 15th century, Italian sculpture continued to evolve and develop. Artists such as Michelangelo and Verrocchio were among the most influential of this period, creating works that were characterized by their naturalism and realism. This was also a time of significant innovation, as artists began to experiment with new techniques and forms.\n\n## Lombardy\n\nLombardy, a region in northern Italy, was also home to a thriving sculptural tradition during the Renaissance. Artists such as Michelangelo and Bramantino were among the most influential of this region, creating works that were characterized by their naturalism and realism. Lombardy was also known for its use of terracotta, a type of clay that was often used to create figurines and decorative objects.\n\n## Crisis of the 1490s\n\nThe 1490s saw a significant crisis in Italian sculpture, as the death of key artists and the rise of new styles and techniques led to a shift in the art world. This was also a time of significant economic and social change, as the Italian city-states began to decline and the Ottoman Empire began to rise.\n\n## 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw a significant shift in Italian sculpture, as artists began to focus on creating more ornate and decorative works.

From its humble beginnings in the Middle East to its current status as a global faith, Christianity has evolved significantly over the centuries, influencing numerous aspects of human culture, society, and politics.\n\n**Early Christianity**\n\n### Jewish Background\n\nChristianity emerged from Judaism, with many early Christians seeing themselves as part of the Jewish people. The Jewish scriptures, particularly the Hebrew Bible, played a significant role in the development of Christian theology and tradition. Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity, was born into a Jewish family and preached a message that was rooted in Jewish scripture and tradition.\n\n### Apostolic Age (c. 30–100)\n\n#### Developing Church Structure\n\nDuring the apostolic age, the early Christian community began to develop a more formal structure. The apostles, who were the closest followers of Jesus, played a crucial role in establishing the church and spreading the gospel message. The apostle Peter, in particular, became a key leader in the early Christian community, and his teachings and writings would later become an essential part of Christian doctrine.\n\n#### Early Growth\n\nThe early Christian community grew rapidly, with converts coming from various backgrounds, including Jews, Gentiles, and even Roman soldiers. The apostles worked tirelessly to spread the message of Jesus Christ, establishing churches in different parts of the Mediterranean world. The apostle Paul, who was instrumental in spreading Christianity to the Gentiles, wrote numerous letters to early Christian communities, providing guidance and instruction on matters of faith and practice.\n\n### Ante-Nicene Period (100–312)\n\n#### Scripture\n\nDuring the ante-Nicene period, the Christian scriptures began to take shape. The New Testament, which includes the four Gospels, Acts, and the Epistles of Paul, among others, was gradually compiled and canonized. The early Christian community recognized the importance of scripture in shaping their faith and practice, and the writings of the apostles and other early Christian leaders became the foundation of Christian theology.\n\n#### Early Christian Art\n\nEarly Christian art, which emerged during this period, played a significant role in communicating the message of Christianity. The use of symbols, imagery, and iconography became a distinctive feature of Christian art, reflecting the faith's emphasis on the Incarnation and the Person of Christ. Early Christian art often depicted scenes from the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the apostles, serving as a visual representation of the Christian story.\n\n#### Persecutions and Legalization\n\nThe ante-Nicene period was marked by numerous persecutions of Christians by the Roman Empire. The early Christian community faced intense hostility, with many being martyred for their faith. However, with the conversion of Emperor Constantine in 312 CE, Christianity began to gain official recognition, paving the way for its eventual legalization.\n\n### Spread of Christianity to c. 300 AD\n\n#### Inclusivity, Women, and Exclusivity\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout the Mediterranean world, it encountered various cultures and communities. The early Christian community, while initially exclusive, gradually became more inclusive, welcoming converts from different backgrounds. The role of women in the early Christian community was significant, with many playing important leadership roles. However, the community also struggled with issues of exclusivity, as seen in the debates over the circumcision of Gentile converts.\n\n#### Moral Practices\n\nThe early Christian community developed a distinctive set of moral practices, including the prohibition of abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia. The community also emphasized the importance of love, compassion, and forgiveness, as seen in the teachings of Jesus Christ. The early Christian community's moral practices reflected their commitment to the values of the kingdom of God.\n\n**Late Antiquity (313–476)**\n\n### Conversion of Constantine\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine in 312 CE marked a significant turning point in the history of Christianity. Constantine's conversion led to the establishment of Christianity as the official state religion of the Roman Empire. The Edict of Milan, issued in 313 CE, granted Christians freedom of worship, paving the way for the eventual legalization of Christianity.\n\n### Christianity and the State\n\nThe relationship between Christianity and the state became increasingly complex during late antiquity. The Christian community's growing influence led to conflicts with the Roman Empire, as seen in the controversy over the Donatist schism. The Christian community also struggled with issues of power and authority, as seen in the debates over the role of bishops and the nature of Church governance.\n\n### Christianity and Polytheism\n\nThe Christian community's relationship with polytheistic cultures was complex and multifaceted. While Christianity was seen as a monotheistic faith, it encountered various forms of polytheism, including the worship of multiple deities and the use of magical practices. The Christian community struggled to reconcile its monotheistic faith with the polytheistic practices of the surrounding cultures.\n\n### Augustine's Ethic Toward Jews\n\nAugustine of Hippo, a prominent Christian leader, developed a distinctive ethic toward Jews. Augustine argued that Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus Christ and that their continued existence was a testament to God's sovereignty. However, Augustine also acknowledged the importance of Jewish scripture and tradition in the development of Christian theology.\n\n### Developing Orthodoxy and Heresy\n\nThe Christian community's struggle with orthodoxy and heresy became increasingly complex during late antiquity. The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) addressed the issue of the nature of Christ, establishing the doctrine of the Trinity as the foundation of Christian theology. However, the Christian community continued to grapple with issues of orthodoxy and heresy, as seen in the controversies over Arius and Athanasius.\n\n### Church of the East\n\nThe Church of the East, also known as the Assyrian Church, emerged in the 1st century and developed a unique set of traditions and practices. The Church of the East played an important role in the spread of Christianity to the East, particularly in the regions of Mesopotamia and Persia.\n\n### Hospitals\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on compassion and care led to the establishment of hospitals and other charitable institutions. The earliest hospitals, such as the one established by Basil of Caesarea, provided care for the sick and the poor.\n\n### Art and Literature\n\nThe Christian community's rich cultural heritage is reflected in the development of art and literature. The use of symbols, imagery, and iconography became a distinctive feature of Christian art, while the writings of Christian authors, such as Augustine and Ambrose, shaped the development of Christian theology.\n\n### Spread and Growth of Christianity\n\nThe Christian community continued to spread and grow throughout the Mediterranean world, establishing churches in various regions. The establishment of Christianity in the Roman Africa province marked an important turning point in the history of the faith.\n\n**Early Middle Ages (476–842)**\n\n### Justinian I\n\nJustinian I, a Byzantine emperor, played a significant role in shaping the development of Christianity during the early Middle Ages. Justinian's reign was marked by a series of persecutions of pagans and heretics, while his codification of Roman law had a lasting impact on the development of Christian theology.\n\n### Education\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on education led to the establishment of schools and universities. The writings of Christian authors, such as Augustine and Ambrose, shaped the development of Christian theology, while the use of Latin became a common language for Christian scholarship.\n\n### Law\n\nThe Christian community's relationship with law became increasingly complex during the early Middle Ages. The establishment of the Byzantine Empire led to the codification of Roman law, which had a lasting impact on the development of Christianity.\n\n### Monasticism\n\nMonasticism, which emerged in the early Middle Ages, played a significant role in the development of Christianity. Monasteries became centers of learning, where monks and nuns studied and wrote about Christian theology.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Christian community's rich cultural heritage is reflected in the development of art during the early Middle Ages. The use of symbols, imagery, and iconography became a distinctive feature of Christian art, while the establishment of iconography led to the development of a unique style of Christian art.\n\n### Papal Supremacy\n\nThe Christian community's struggle with papal supremacy became increasingly complex during the early Middle Ages. The establishment of the papacy led to conflicts with the Byzantine Empire, while the role of the bishop of Rome became increasingly important in the development of Christianity.\n\n### Spread and Growth of Christianity\n\nThe Christian community continued to spread and grow throughout the Mediterranean world, establishing churches in various regions. The establishment of Christianity in German Europe, Britain, and Ireland marked an important turning point in the history of the faith.\n\n**High Middle Ages (842–1299)**\n\n### Christendom 842-1099\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on unity and cooperation led to the establishment of Christendom, a period of relative peace and stability in Europe. The Christian community's struggle with external threats, such as the Viking invasions, became increasingly complex during the high Middle Ages.\n\n### Tenth and Eleventh Century Reform\n\nThe Christian community's struggle with corruption and abuse of power led to a series of reforms during the tenth and eleventh centuries. The establishment of the Gregorian Reform led to the development of a more centralized and hierarchical Church.\n\n### Investiture Controversy (1078)\n\nThe Christian community's struggle with the issue of investiture became increasingly complex during the high Middle Ages. The investiture controversy between the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire led to conflicts and power struggles.\n\n### Toledo 1085\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on conversion and evangelism led to the establishment of Christianity in Spain, particularly in the region of Toledo. The establishment of the archdiocese of Toledo marked an important turning point in the history of Christianity in Spain.\n\n### First Crusade (1095)\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on holy war and military conquest led to the establishment of the First Crusade, a series of military campaigns aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule.\n\n### Learning and Change\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on learning and intellectual inquiry led to a series of significant developments during the high Middle Ages. The establishment of universities, such as the University of Paris, marked a turning point in the history of Christian theology.\n\n### Scholasticism, Renaissance, and Science (1150-1200)\n\nThe Christian community's emphasis on reason and intellectual inquiry led to the development of scholasticism, a school of thought that sought to reconcile faith and reason.

It is a remake of the 2016 Kannada film of the same name.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film revolves around a prison warden, John Donavooris, who is known for his strict and efficient approach to managing the prison. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he is forced to confront his past and face a powerful and ruthless gangster, who has been released from prison.

The team also conducted extensive research on the prison system and the challenges faced by prison wardens. The pre-production phase was marked by several changes in the cast, including the addition of Nayanthara and Vadivelu.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for Jailer was a lengthy and complex one, with several actors being approached and turned down before the final cast was assembled.

The film's producers were accused of copying several scenes and ideas from other films, including a Kannada film released earlier in the year. The controversy was addressed by the filmmakers, who claimed that the similarities were unintentional and that they had taken inspiration from various sources.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nJailer received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's action sequences and performances, while others criticized the film's narrative and editing.

However, no official announcement has been made regarding the sequel, and the project is still in the development stage.\n\n# Documentary series\n\nA documentary series based on Jailer is currently in production, with the filmmakers releasing a series of behind-the-scenes videos and promotional materials on social media.

The novel is a critique of modern society and a reflection on the nature of resistance and revolution. The Aesthetics of Resistance is considered a masterpiece of 20th-century literature and has been widely studied and debated.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe novel is set in the 1960s and follows the story of a group of intellectuals and artists who are struggling to understand and respond to the social and political upheavals of the time. The main character, a young art historian named Winkel, becomes embroiled in a series of events that lead him to question his own values and loyalties. As the novel unfolds, Winkel finds himself drawn into a world of resistance and revolution, where he must confront the complexities and contradictions of modern society.\n\nThe plot of the novel is fragmented and episodic, reflecting the disjointed and fragmented nature of modern experience. Winkel's narrative is interspersed with passages of poetry, philosophy, and art history, which serve to illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of the world around him. Through Winkel's story, Weiss explores themes of alienation, identity, and the search for meaning in a postmodern world.\n\n# Form features and structure\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental novel that challenges traditional notions of narrative structure and form. The novel is divided into three volumes, each of which has a distinct narrative and stylistic tone. The first volume is a relatively straightforward narrative, while the second volume is more fragmented and experimental. The third volume is a kind of philosophical and poetic treatise, in which Winkel reflects on the nature of resistance and revolution.\n\nOne of the key features of the novel is its use of multiple narrative voices and perspectives. Winkel's narrative is interspersed with passages of poetry, philosophy, and art history, which serve to illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of the world around him. The novel also includes a number of non-narrative sections, including philosophical and poetic treatises, which serve to underscore the complexity and depth of the themes being explored.\n\n# History of origins and publication\n\n## Beginning\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first conceived in the early 1960s, when Weiss was living in Paris. At the time, Weiss was deeply engaged in the intellectual and artistic ferment of the French capital, and he was inspired by the work of artists and writers such as Andy Warhol, Marcel Duchamp, and Samuel Beckett.\n\n## Research\n\nWeiss spent several years researching and writing the novel, drawing on a wide range of sources including art history, philosophy, and politics. He was particularly interested in the concept of \"resistance,\" which he saw as a key theme in the novel. Weiss was influenced by the work of thinkers such as Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse, who wrote extensively on the topic of resistance and revolution.\n\n## Writer's block\n\nWeiss struggled with writer's block for several years, finding it difficult to bring his vision for the novel to life. He eventually broke through the block by writing a series of short stories and poems, which he later incorporated into the novel.\n\n## The third volume\n\nThe third volume of the novel was the most difficult to write, as Weiss was struggling to find a way to bring the narrative to a close. He eventually solved the problem by writing a kind of philosophical and poetic treatise, in which Winkel reflects on the nature of resistance and revolution.\n\n## Sweden and the GDR\n\nThe novel was first published in Sweden in 1975, and it quickly became a bestseller. In 1976, the novel was translated into German and published in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The novel was widely praised in the GDR, where it was seen as a powerful critique of modern society.\n\n## Other translations\n\nThe novel has since been translated into many languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian. It has been widely studied and debated in academic and literary circles, and it is considered a masterpiece of 20th-century literature.\n\n# Textual forms\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental novel that challenges traditional notions of narrative structure and form. The novel includes a wide range of textual forms, including:\n\n* Poetry: The novel includes a number of passages of poetry, which serve to illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of the world around Winkel.\n* Philosophy: The novel includes a number of philosophical treatises, which serve to underscore the complexity and depth of the themes being explored.\n* Art history: The novel includes a number of passages of art history, which serve to illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of modern art.\n\n# Artists and artworks in the novel\n\n## Divine Comedy\n\nThe novel includes a number of references to Dante's Divine Comedy, which serves as a kind of narrative and philosophical framework for the novel. Winkel's journey through the novel is seen as a kind of journey through the realms of hell, purgatory, and paradise.\n\n## Central artworks\n\nThe novel includes a number of references to central artworks, including Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling and Picasso's Guernica. These artworks serve to illustrate the complex and multifaceted nature of modern art.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe novel raises a number of questions about the nature of resistance and revolution, including:\n\n* What is the relationship between art and politics?\n* How can we create a more just and equitable society?\n* What is the role of the artist in a postmodern world?\n\n# Reception\n\n## Mixed reactions in culture\n\nThe novel received mixed reactions in cultural and literary circles. Some reviewers praised the novel's innovative and experimental style, while others found it difficult to follow.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn Germany, the novel was widely praised for its critique of modern society. The novel was seen as a powerful critique of the social and economic systems of the GDR.\n\n## Worldwide\n\nThe novel has been widely studied and debated in academic and literary circles worldwide. It is considered a masterpiece of 20th-century literature and has been translated into many languages.\n\n## Reading groups\n\nThe novel has been the subject of numerous reading groups and workshops, where readers and scholars have discussed its themes and ideas.\n\n## Intermedial Reception\n\nThe novel has been the subject of intermedial reception, with scholars and artists exploring its connections to other art forms, including film, music, and visual art.\n\n# Radio play\n\nThe novel was adapted into a radio play in 1978, which was broadcast on German radio. The radio play was well-received and helped to introduce the novel to a wider audience.\n\n# Film\n\nThe novel was adapted into a film in 1982, which was directed by Peter Lilienthal. The film was well-received and helped to cement the novel's status as a classic of 20th-century literature.\n\n# Musical recordings\n\nThe novel has been the subject of several musical recordings, including a cantata by composer Hans Werner Henze.\n\n# See also\n\n* Literature\n\t+ Thesis: The Aesthetics of Resistance has been the subject of numerous theses and dissertations.\n\t+ English editions in print: The novel has been translated into English and published in several editions.\n\t+ GDR reception: The novel was widely praised in the GDR for its critique of modern society.\n\n# References\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Aesthetics_of_Resistance\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Form features and structure\n#History of origins and publication\n##Beginning\n##Research\n##Writers block\n##The third volume\n##Sweden and the GDR\n##Other translations\n#Textual forms\n#Artists and artworks in the novel\n##Divine Comedy\n##Central artworks\n##Questions\n#Reception\n##Mixed reactions in culture\n###Germany\n##Worldwide\n##Reading groups\n##Intermedial Reception\n#Radio play\n#Film\n#Musical recordings\n#See also\n#Literature\n##Thesis\n##English editions in print\n##GDR reception\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The UPA was a paramilitary organization that fought against both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, with the ultimate goal of establishing an independent Ukrainian state.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists\n\nThe Ukrainian Insurgent Army was formed by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), a nationalist movement that had been active in Ukraine since the 1920s. The OUN was founded by the Association of Ukrainian Nationalists (Svoboda), a group that sought to promote Ukrainian independence and nationalism. The OUN was divided into two factions: the OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera, and the OUN-M, led by Andriy Melnyk.\n\n### Outbreak of the war\n\nWhen the Soviet Union invaded Poland in 1939, Ukraine was annexed by the Soviet Union. The OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera, was banned by the Soviet authorities and many of its members were arrested or executed. However, the OUN-B continued to operate underground and began to plan a resistance movement against the Soviet occupation.\n\n### Creation of OUN-B, pogroms, and anti-Soviet uprising\n\nIn 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and the OUN-B saw an opportunity to establish an independent Ukrainian state. The OUN-B began to organize a resistance movement, which included the creation of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). The UPA was formed in April 1941 and was led by Stepan Bandera. The UPA's initial goal was to establish an independent Ukrainian state, but it soon became clear that the UPA would have to fight against both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.\n\n### Creation of UPA, anti-German uprising, and extermination of Poles\n\nIn June 1941, the UPA launched an uprising against the Soviet authorities, but it was quickly crushed. The UPA then turned its attention to fighting against Nazi Germany, which had invaded Ukraine. The UPA saw the Nazis as occupiers who were suppressing Ukrainian nationalism and culture. The UPA also launched a campaign to exterminate the Polish population in Ukraine, which was seen as a threat to Ukrainian independence.\n\n**Armed resistance during the war (1944–1945)**\n\n### Fights in Volhynia and Podolia (first half of 1944)\n\nThe UPA began to organize armed resistance against the Soviet authorities in the first half of 1944. The UPA launched a series of attacks against Soviet forces in Volhynia and Podolia, which were key regions in Ukraine. The UPA's goal was to drive the Soviet forces out of these regions and establish an independent Ukrainian state.\n\n### After German expulsion from Ukraine\n\nAfter the German expulsion from Ukraine in 1944, the UPA began to launch a series of attacks against Soviet forces. The UPA's goal was to establish an independent Ukrainian state and to drive the Soviet forces out of Ukraine.\n\n### Battle of Zaliznytsia (28 April 1944)\n\nThe UPA launched a major attack against Soviet forces in the Battle of Zaliznytsia on 28 April 1944. The UPA's goal was to drive the Soviet forces out of the region and establish an independent Ukrainian state. The battle was fierce, but the UPA was ultimately defeated.\n\n### Battle of Piryatin (19 August 1944)\n\nThe UPA launched a major attack against Soviet forces in the Battle of Piryatin on 19 August 1944. The UPA's goal was to drive the Soviet forces out of the region and establish an independent Ukrainian state.

The film stars Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Björk, and Willem Dafoe.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThe Northman is a cinematic adaptation of the epic poem \"The Saga of Grettir the Strong\", set in 10th-century Iceland. The film tells the story of Amleth, a young Viking with a thirst for revenge, who seeks to avenge his father's murder and reclaim his rightful place as the king of his tribe. With a richly detailed and atmospheric setting, the film explores themes of power, loyalty, and the complexities of human nature.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe Northman follows the story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a young Viking warrior who witnesses the brutal murder of his father, a chieftain named Earl, by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth vows to avenge his father's death and reclaim his rightful place as the king of his tribe. To achieve this, he must navigate the treacherous world of Viking politics, where loyalty, honor, and betrayal are the currencies of power.\n\nAs Amleth embarks on his quest for revenge, he faces numerous challenges and obstacles, including treacherous landscapes, fierce enemies, and his own inner demons. Along the way, he meets a mysterious woman named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who becomes his ally and potential love interest. Together, they must confront the forces of darkness that threaten their people and their way of life.\n\nCast\n----\n\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth\n* Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún\n* Claes Bang as Fjölnir\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga\n* Björk as Sorceress\n* Willem Dafoe as King Aurvandil\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Development\n\nThe Northman was first announced in 2017, with Robert Eggers set to write and direct the film. Eggers, known for his work on The Witch (2015), was inspired by the epic poem \"The Saga of Grettir the Strong\" and saw parallels between the story and his own Swedish heritage. The film's script was developed over several years, with Eggers collaborating with his co-writers, Jeff Nichols and Martin Scorsese.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Northman began in January 2020 on the island of Iceland. The film's production team spent several months scouting locations and building sets, which included a replica of a 10th-century Viking village. Skarsgård and other cast members spent extensive time in physical training, learning Viking combat and survival skills.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production for The Northman took several months, during which time the film's editors, Louise Ford and Louise McHugh, worked closely with Eggers to shape the final cut. The film's visual effects team, led by Jeff McIntyre, created intricate and detailed depictions of Viking-era landscapes and creatures.\n\n### Music\n\nThe Northman's original score was composed by Robin Carolud, who drew inspiration from traditional Viking music and folk instruments. The score features a haunting and atmospheric soundscape, which complements the film's visuals and narrative.\n\nMarketing\n----------\n\n### Tie-in media\n\nIn conjunction with the film's release, a tie-in video game, The Northman: The Lost Chapter, was released. The game follows Amleth's journey as he navigates the Viking world and confronts his enemies. Players can explore the game's vast open world, engage in combat, and solve puzzles.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe Northman premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2022, where it received a standing ovation. The film was released in theaters on April 22, 2022, in the United States and on April 29, 2022, in the United Kingdom.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Northman was released on DVD and Blu-ray in July 2022. The home media release includes several special features, including an audio commentary with Robert Eggers and Alexander Skarsgård, and a behind-the-scenes look at the film's production.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Northman grossed over $100 million worldwide, with a domestic box office total of over $50 million.

The consensus reads: \"The Northman is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant epic, anchored by a powerful performance from Alexander Skarsgård.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 60 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Many critics praised the film's visuals, performances, and historical accuracy, with some noting its slow pace and occasionally confusing plot.\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe Northman was nominated for several awards, including:\n\n* Academy Awards:\n\t+ Best Cinematography (Robby Ryan)\n\t+ Best Production Design (Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer)\n* Golden Globe Awards:\n\t+ Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama (Alexander Skarsgård)\n* BAFTA Awards:\n\t+ Best Cinematography (Robby Ryan)\n\t+ Best Production Design (Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer)\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThe Northman is a significant achievement in the world of historical epic films, with its richly detailed setting, atmospheric score, and powerful performances.

The term \"Sun Belt\" was first coined in the 1940s to describe the region's favorable climate and economic prospects. Today, the Sun Belt is a major economic and demographic powerhouse, with many of the country's fastest-growing cities and states located within its boundaries.\n\n# Migration\n\nThe Sun Belt has experienced significant migration and population growth over the past several decades. The region's warm and sunny climate, as well as its relatively low cost of living, have made it an attractive destination for people fleeing colder and more expensive climates in the Northeast and Midwest. The Sun Belt's population has grown at a rate significantly higher than the national average, with many of its cities experiencing rapid growth and urbanization.\n\n## Factors Contributing to Migration\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the Sun Belt's rapid population growth and migration. One of the primary factors is the region's favorable climate, with warm and sunny weather year-round. This makes it an attractive destination for people who are tired of the cold and snow of the Northeast and Midwest. Additionally, the Sun Belt's relatively low cost of living has made it an attractive destination for people looking to escape the high cost of living in other parts of the country.\n\n## Demographic Characteristics\n\nThe Sun Belt's population is demographically diverse, with a mix of young and old, urban and rural, and minority and non-minority populations.

The region's economy is driven by a mix of industries, including tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing.\n\n# Projections\n\nThe Sun Belt is expected to continue to experience rapid population growth and economic development over the next several decades. The region's population is projected to grow at a rate of 10% to 15% per year, with many of its cities experiencing rapid growth and urbanization.\n\n## Factors Contributing to Growth\n\nSeveral factors are expected to contribute to the Sun Belt's continued growth and development. One of the primary factors is the region's favorable climate, which will continue to attract people from other parts of the country. Additionally, the region's highly developed infrastructure and business-friendly climate will continue to make it an attractive destination for businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n## Challenges and Opportunities\n\nThe Sun Belt's continued growth and development will also present several challenges and opportunities. One of the primary challenges will be managing the region's rapid population growth and urbanization, which will place pressure on the region's infrastructure and resources. Additionally, the region's economy will continue to be influenced by global economic trends and events.\n\n# Politics\n\nThe Sun Belt is a highly politicized region, with many of its states and cities playing a significant role in national and state politics.\n\n## Voting Patterns\n\nThe Sun Belt is characterized by its strong conservative voting patterns, with many of its states and cities voting Republican in national elections. However, the region's voting patterns are also influenced by its growing diversity and increasingly liberal demographics.\n\n## Policy Issues\n\nThe Sun Belt is characterized by several key policy issues, including immigration, healthcare, and education.

It was the sixth assembly election since the devolved government was established in 1998. The election saw a significant increase in the number of candidates, with 1,242 individuals vying for a seat in the assembly.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Electoral events\n\nThe 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election was held on the same day as the local elections in Northern Ireland. The election was called after the Northern Ireland Assembly was dissolved on March 24, 2022. The election marked the end of a five-year term for the assembly, which was established in 2017. The election was also notable for being the first time that the assembly had been dissolved and re-elected since the Brexit referendum in 2016.\n\n### Leadership changes\n\nThe 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election saw significant leadership changes within the main parties. The Sinn Féin party, led by Michelle O'Neill, emerged as the largest party in the assembly, winning 27 seats. The DUP, led by Jeffrey Donaldson, won 25 seats, while the Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long, won 17 seats. The Ulster Unionist Party, led by Doug Beattie, won 8 seats, and the SDLP, led by Colum Eastwood, won 12 seats.\n\n### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election was held in the context of the ongoing Northern Ireland Protocol, a trade agreement negotiated as part of the Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. The protocol created a customs border in the Irish Sea, which has been a source of controversy and tension in Northern Ireland. The DUP, in particular, has been critical of the protocol, arguing that it undermines the integrity of the UK and creates economic and trade barriers.\n\n### Calls for early election\n\nThere were calls for an early election in the run-up to the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. The DUP, in particular, had been pushing for an early election, arguing that the assembly was dysfunctional and that an election was needed to give the people of Northern Ireland a voice. However, the other main parties, including Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party, had been opposed to an early election, arguing that it would be a waste of resources and would not provide a clear outcome.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nThere were 1,242 candidates vying for a seat in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. The candidates included 846 individuals who were standing for the first time, while 396 individuals were seeking re-election.

The party had also been running a series of events and rallies across the province, highlighting its message and policies.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThere were a number of opinion polls conducted in the run-up to the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. These polls showed a range of different outcomes, with some indicating that the DUP would emerge as the largest party, while others suggested that Sinn Féin would emerge as the largest party.\n\nA poll conducted by the Belfast Telegraph in March 2022 showed that the DUP was on course to win 26 seats, while Sinn Féin was on course to win 24 seats. A poll conducted by the Irish News in April 2022 showed that Sinn Féin was on course to win 27 seats, while the DUP was on course to win 23 seats.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election were announced on May 6, 2022.

The tournament is the shortest format of international cricket, played over a period of six weeks, with each match lasting for approximately three hours.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe concept of a Twenty20 World Cup was first proposed in 2006 by the ICC to provide a new, shorter format of international cricket. The idea was to create a tournament that would be more appealing to a wider audience, particularly in countries where Test cricket was not as popular. The first edition of the tournament was scheduled to take place in 2008, but it was later postponed to 2009.\n\n#### Domestic tournaments\n\nBefore the introduction of the T20 format, domestic tournaments in various countries had already adopted the format. The Indian Premier League (IPL) was one of the first domestic T20 leagues to be established, with the first season taking place in 2008. Other domestic T20 leagues, such as the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and the Big Bash League (BBL), were also established around the same time. These leagues provided a platform for players to gain experience and exposure in the T20 format, which eventually paved the way for the introduction of the T20 World Cup.\n\n#### Twenty20 Internationals\n\nThe first T20I match was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2005. The match was played at the Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, and Australia won by 44 runs. The first T20I series was played between England and Australia in 2005, with England winning the series 2-0. The T20I format quickly gained popularity, and by 2007, all 12 full-member countries of the ICC had played T20Is.\n\n### Inaugural edition\n\nThe first edition of the T20 World Cup was played in 2007 in South Africa. Eight national teams participated in the tournament, with the West Indies being crowned the champions. The final match was played between India and the South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. The West Indies won the match by 20 runs, with Ramnaresh Sarwan scoring 92 runs.\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams\n\nThe second edition of the T20 World Cup was played in 2009 in England. The tournament was expanded to include 12 teams, with the four Associate Member teams participating as qualifiers. The tournament was won by Pakistan, who defeated Sri Lanka in the final. The third edition of the tournament was played in 2010 in the West Indies, with Sri Lanka winning the tournament. The fourth edition was played in 2012 in Sri Lanka, with West Indies winning the tournament.\n\n### Expansion to 20 teams\n\nThe fifth edition of the T20 World Cup was played in 2014 in Bangladesh, with Sri Lanka winning the tournament. The tournament was expanded to include 16 teams, with the four Associate Member teams participating as qualifiers. The sixth edition of the tournament was played in 2016 in India, with the West Indies winning the tournament. The seventh edition was played in 2018 in the United Arab Emirates, with West Indies winning the tournament.\n\n**Hosts**\n\nThe T20 World Cup has been hosted by several countries over the years. The first edition was hosted by South Africa in 2007. The second edition was hosted by England in 2009. The third edition was hosted by the West Indies in 2010. The fourth edition was hosted by Sri Lanka in 2012. The fifth edition was hosted by Bangladesh in 2014. The sixth edition was hosted by India in 2016. The seventh edition was hosted by the United Arab Emirates in 2018.\n\n**Formats**\n\n### Qualification\n\nThe qualification process for the T20 World Cup involves several rounds of matches played between teams from different regions. The teams that qualify for the tournament are determined by their performance in these matches. The qualification process typically starts with a series of matches played between teams from the same region, with the top teams qualifying for the next round.\n\n### Final tournament\n\nThe final tournament is played between the teams that have qualified for the tournament. The tournament is typically played in a round-robin format, with the teams divided into groups. The top teams from each group qualify for the knockout stage, which is played in a knockout format. The knockout stage typically involves a series of matches played between the top teams, with the winner of each match advancing to the next round.\n\n**Trophy**\n\nThe trophy awarded to the winner of the T20 World Cup is called the ICC Men's T20 World Cup trophy. The trophy is a gold-plated trophy, with a design that features a globe surrounded by a wreath of leaves. The trophy is awarded to the winner of the tournament, and is displayed in the winner's country for a period of one year.\n\n**Attendance**\n\nThe attendance figures for the T20 World Cup have been steadily increasing over the years. The first edition of the tournament had an average attendance of 18,000 spectators per match. The second edition had an average attendance of 25,000 spectators per match. The third edition had an average attendance of 30,000 spectators per match.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the T20 World Cup have been as follows:\n\n* 2007: West Indies won the tournament, defeating South Africa in the final.\n* 2009: Pakistan won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka in the final.\n* 2010: Sri Lanka won the tournament, defeating New Zealand in the final.\n* 2012: West Indies won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka in the final.\n* 2014: Sri Lanka won the tournament, defeating India in the final.\n* 2016: West Indies won the tournament, defeating England in the final.\n* 2018: West Indies won the tournament, defeating New Zealand in the final.\n\n**Team performance**\n\nThe team performance in the T20 World Cup has varied over the years.

In 2022, tropical cyclones affected various regions around the world, causing significant impacts on communities and environments. This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022, a summary of the tropical cyclone activity in each major ocean basin, and a detailed account of the systems that formed and affected various regions throughout the year.\n\n**Global Atmospheric and Hydrological Conditions**\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 were influenced by various climate patterns and trends. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle was in a neutral phase, with neither El Niño nor La Niña conditions prevailing. This neutral phase of ENSO contributed to a relatively stable global atmospheric circulation pattern, which in turn influenced the development and trajectory of tropical cyclones.\n\n**Summary**\n\n### North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe North Atlantic Ocean experienced a relatively active hurricane season in 2022, with 18 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). The season was marked by several intense storms, including Hurricane Ian, which made landfall in Cuba and Florida, causing significant damage and loss of life.\n\n### Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Eastern Pacific Ocean saw a below-average number of named storms in 2022, with 11 systems forming. However, several storms, including Tropical Storms Javier and Kay, brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region. The Central Pacific Ocean, which includes Hawaii, experienced a relatively quiet season, with only two named storms, neither of which affected the islands.\n\n### Western Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Western Pacific Ocean, also known as the Northwestern Pacific, was the most active basin in 2022, with 31 named storms, 14 typhoons, and 7 super typhoons (Category 4 or higher). The region was affected by several intense storms, including Typhoon Noru, which caused widespread damage and flooding in the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\n### North Indian Ocean\n\nThe North Indian Ocean experienced a below-average number of cyclonic storms in 2022, with 5 systems forming.
