{"title": "Halloween", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word Halloween or Hallowe'en (\"Saints' evening\" [40]) is of Christian origin; [41] [42] a term equivalent to \"All Hallows Eve\" as attested in Old English [43] The word hallowe [']en comes from the Scottish form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before All Hallows' Day): [44] even is the Scots term for \"eve\" or \"evening\", [45] and is contracted to e'en or een; [46] (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Hallowe'en.\n\n\nHistory\nHalloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices [47] [23] The English word 'Halloween' comes from \"All Hallows' Eve\", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November [48] Since the time of the early Church, [49] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows [50] [47] These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates, mostly in springtime [51] In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\" [52] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead [53]\n\n\nChristian origins and historic customs\nHalloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices [47] [23] The English word 'Halloween' comes from \"All Hallows' Eve\", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November [48] Since the time of the early Church, [49] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before,

609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\" [52] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead [53]\n\n\nGaelic folk influence\nToday's Halloween customs are thought to have been influenced by folk customs and beliefs from the Celtic-speaking countries, some of which are believed to have pagan roots [105] Jack Santino, a folklorist, writes that \"there was throughout Ireland an uneasy truce existing between customs and beliefs associated with Christianity and those associated with religions that were Irish before Christianity arrived\" [106] The origins of Halloween customs are typically linked to the Gaelic festival Samhain [107]\n\n\nSpread to North America\nLesley Bannatyne and Cindy Ott write that Anglican colonists in the southern United States and Catholic colonists in Maryland \"recognized All Hallows' Eve in their church calendars\", [141] [142] although the Puritans of New England strongly opposed the holiday, along with other traditional celebrations of the established Church, including Christmas [143] Almanacs of the late 18th and early 19th century give no indication that Halloween was widely celebrated in North America [26]\n\n\nSymbols\nDevelopment of artifacts and symbols associated with Halloween formed over time Jack-o'-lanterns are traditionally carried by guisers on All Hallows' Eve in order to frighten evil spirits [75] [148] There is a popular Irish Christian folktale associated with the jack-o'-lantern, [149] which in folklore is said to represent a \"soul who has been denied entry into both heaven and hell\": [150]\n\n\nTrick-or-treating and guising\nTrick-or-treating is a customary celebration for children on Halloween Children go in costume from house to house, asking for treats such as candy or sometimes money, with the question, \"Trick or treat?\" The word \"trick\" implies a \"threat\" to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given [66] The practice is said to have roots in the medieval practice of mumming, which is closely related to souling [165] John Pymm wrote that \"many of the feast days associated with the presentation of mumming plays were celebrated by the Christian Church.\" [166] These feast days included All Hallows' Eve, Christmas, Twelfth Night and Shrove Tuesday [167] [168] Mumming practiced in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe, [169] involved masked persons in fancy dress who \"paraded the streets and entered houses to dance or play dice in silence\" [170]\n\n\nCostumes\nHalloween costumes were traditionally modeled after figures such as vampires, ghosts, skeletons, scary looking witches, and devils [66] Over time, the costume selection extended to include popular characters from fiction, celebrities, and generic archetypes such as ninjas and princesses.\n\n\nPet costumes\nAccording to a 2018 report from the National Retail Federation, 30 million Americans will spend an estimated $480 million on Halloween costumes for their pets in 2018 This is up from an estimated $200 million in 2010 The most popular costumes for pets are the pumpkin, followed by the hot dog, and the bumblebee in third place [198]\n\n\nGames and other activities\nThere are several games traditionally associated with Halloween Some of these games originated as divination rituals or ways of foretelling one's future, especially regarding death, marriage and children During the Middle Ages, these rituals were done by a \"rare few\" in rural communities as they were considered to be \"deadly serious\" practices [199] In recent centuries, these divination games have been \"a common feature of the household festivities\" in Ireland and Britain [127] They often involve apples and hazelnuts In Celtic mythology, apples were strongly associated with the Otherworld and immortality, while hazelnuts were associated with divine wisdom [200] Some also suggest that they derive from Roman practices in celebration of Pomona [66]\n\n\nHaunted attractions\nHaunted attractions are entertainment venues designed to thrill and scare patrons Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses that may include haunted houses, corn mazes, and hayrides, [219] and the level of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown.\n\n\nFood\nOn All Hallows' Eve, many Western Christian denominations encourage abstinence from meat, giving rise to a variety of vegetarian foods associated with this day [236]\n\n\nChristian observances\nOn Hallowe'en (All Hallows' Eve), in Poland, believers were once taught to pray out loud as they walk through the forests in order that the souls of the dead might find comfort; in Spain, Christian priests in tiny villages toll their church bells in order to remind their congregants to remember the dead on All Hallows' Eve [245] In Ireland, and among immigrants in Canada, a custom includes the Christian practice of abstinence, keeping All Hallows' Eve as a meat-free day and serving pancakes or colcannon instead [246]\n\n\nAnalogous celebrations and perspectives\nAccording to Alfred J Kolatch in the Second Jewish Book of Why, in Judaism, Halloween is not permitted by Jewish Halakha because it violates Leviticus 18:3, which forbids Jews from partaking in Gentile customs Many Jews observe Yizkor communally four times a year, which is vaguely similar to the observance of Allhallowtide in Christianity, in the sense that prayers are said for both \"martyrs and for one's own family\" [277] Nevertheless, many American Jews celebrate Halloween, disconnected from its Christian origins [278] Reform Rabbi Jeffrey Goldwasser has said that \"There is no religious reason why contemporary Jews should not celebrate Halloween\" while Orthodox Rabbi Michael Broyde has argued against Jews' observing the holiday [279] Purim has sometimes been compared to Halloween, in part due to some observants wearing costumes, especially of Biblical figures described in the Purim narrative [280]\n\n\nJudaism\nAccording to Alfred J Kolatch in the Second Jewish Book of Why, in Judaism, Halloween is not permitted by Jewish Halakha because it violates Leviticus 18:3, which forbids Jews from partaking in Gentile customs Many Jews observe Yizkor communally four times a year, which is vaguely similar to the observance of

argued against Jews' observing the holiday [279] Purim has sometimes been compared to Halloween, in part due to some observants wearing costumes, especially of Biblical figures described in the Purim narrative [280]\n\n\nIslam\nSheikh Idris Palmer, author of A Brief Illustrated Guide to Understanding Islam, has ruled that Muslims should not participate in Halloween, stating that \"participation in Halloween is worse than participation in Christmas, Easter, .. it is more sinful than congratulating the Christians for their prostration to the crucifix\" [281] It has also been ruled to be haram by the National Fatwa Council of Malaysia because of its alleged pagan roots stating \"Halloween is celebrated using a humorous theme mixed with horror to entertain and resist the spirit of death that influence humans\" [282] [283] Dar Al-Ifta Al-Missriyyah disagrees provided the celebration is not referred to as an 'eid' and that behaviour remains in line with Islamic principles [284]\n\n\nHinduism\nHindus remember the dead during the festival of Pitru Paksha, during which Hindus pay homage to and perform a ceremony \"to keep the souls of their ancestors at rest\" It is celebrated in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada, usually in mid-September [285] The celebration of the Hindu festival Diwali sometimes conflicts with the date of Halloween; but some Hindus choose to participate in the popular customs of Halloween [286] Other Hindus, such as Soumya Dasgupta, have opposed the celebration on the grounds that Western holidays like Halloween have \"begun to adversely affect our indigenous festivals\" [287]\n\n\nNeopaganism\nThere is no consistent rule or view on Halloween amongst those who describe themselves as Neopagans or Wiccans Some Neopagans do not observe Halloween, but instead observe Samhain on 1 November, [288] some neopagans do enjoy Halloween festivities, stating that one can observe both \"the solemnity of Samhain in addition to the fun of Halloween\" Some neopagans are opposed to the celebration of Hallowe'en, stating that it \"trivializes Samhain\", [289] and \"avoid Halloween, because of the interruptions from trick or treaters\" [290] The Manitoban writes that \"Wiccans don't officially celebrate Halloween, despite the fact that 31 Oct will still have a star beside it in any good Wiccan's day planner Starting at sundown, Wiccans celebrate a holiday known as Samhain Samhain actually comes from old Celtic traditions and is not exclusive to Neopagan religions like Wicca While the traditions of this holiday originate in Celtic countries, modern day Wiccans don't try to historically replicate Samhain celebrations Some traditional Samhain rituals are still practised, but at its core, the period is treated as a time to celebrate darkness and the dead – a possible reason why Samhain can be confused with Halloween celebrations.\" [288]\n\n\nGeography\nThe traditions and importance of Halloween vary greatly among countries that observe it In Scotland and Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include children dressing up in costume going \"guising\", holding parties, while other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays [173] [291] [292] In Brittany children would play practical jokes by setting candles inside skulls in graveyards to frighten visitors [293] Mass transatlantic immigration in the 19th century popularized Halloween in North America, and celebration in the United States and Canada has had a significant impact on how the event is observed in other nations [173] This larger North American influence, particularly in iconic and commercial elements, has extended to places such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, [294] Australia, [295] New Zealand, [296] (most) continental Europe, Finland, [297] Japan, and other parts of East Asia [16]\n\n\nCost\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, Americans are expected to spend $12.2 billion on Halloween in 2023, up from $10.6 billion in 2022 Of this amount, $3.9 billion is projected to be spent on home decorations, up from $2.7 billion in 2019 The popularity of Halloween decorations has been growing in recent years, with retailers offering a wider range of increasingly elaborate and oversized decorations [298]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) =

In Celtic mythology, apples were strongly associated with the Otherworld and immortality, while hazelnuts were associated with divine wisdom. Some also suggest that they derive from Roman practices in celebration of Pomona.\n\n**Haunted Attractions**\n\nHaunted attractions are entertainment venues designed to thrill and scare patrons. Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses that may include haunted houses, corn mazes, and hayrides, and the level of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown.\n\n**Food**\n\nOn All Hallows' Eve, many Western Christian denominations encourage abstinence from meat, giving rise to a variety of vegetarian foods associated with this day.\n\n**Christian Observances**\n\nOn Hallowe'en (All Hallows' Eve), in Poland, believers were once taught to pray out loud as they walk through the forests in order that the souls of the dead might find comfort.

Some neopagans are opposed to the celebration of Hallowe'en, stating that it \"trivializes Samhain\", and \"avoid Halloween, because of the interruptions from trick or treaters\".\n\n**Geography**\n\nThe traditions and importance of Halloween vary greatly among countries that observe it. In Scotland and Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include children dressing up in costume, going \"guising\", holding parties, while other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays. Mass transatlantic immigration in the 19th century popularized Halloween in North America, and celebration in the United States and Canada has had a significant impact on how the event is observed in other nations. This larger North American influence, particularly in iconic and commercial elements, has extended to places such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, (most) continental Europe, Finland, Japan, and other parts of East Asia.\n\n**Cost**\n\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, Americans are expected to spend $12.2 billion on Halloween in 2023, up from $10.6 billion in 2022. Of this amount, $3.9 billion is projected to be spent on home decorations, up from $2.7 billion in 2019. The popularity of Halloween decorations has been growing in recent years, with retailers offering a wider range of increasingly elaborate and oversized decorations.\n\n**See also**\n\nHalloween is a holiday celebrated on October 31st of each year, with its roots in ancient festivals and traditions.

outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word Halloween or Hallowe'en (\"Saints' evening\" [40]) is of Christian origin; [41] [42] a term equivalent to \"All Hallows Eve\" as attested in Old English [43] The word hallowe [']en comes from the Scottish form of All Hallows' Eve (the evening before All Hallows' Day): [44] even is the Scots term for \"eve\" or \"evening\", [45] and is contracted to e'en or een; [46] (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en became Hallowe'en.\n\n\nHistory\nHalloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and practices [47] [23] The English word 'Halloween' comes from \"All Hallows' Eve\", being the evening before the Christian holy days of All Hallows' Day (All Saints' Day) on 1 November and All Souls' Day on 2 November [48] Since the time of the early Church, [49] major feasts in Christianity (such as Christmas, Easter and Pentecost) had vigils that began the night before, as did the feast of All Hallows [50] [47] These three days are collectively called Allhallowtide and are a time when Western Christians honour all saints and pray for recently departed souls who have yet to reach Heaven Commemorations of all saints and martyrs were held by several churches on various dates, mostly in springtime [51] In 4th-century Roman Edessa it was held on 13 May, and on 13 May 609, Pope Boniface IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\" [52] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead [53]\n\n\nChristian origins and historic customs\nHalloween is thought to have influences from Christian beliefs and

IV re-dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to \"St Mary and all martyrs\" [52] This was the date of Lemuria, an ancient Roman festival of the dead [53]\n\n\nGaelic folk influence\nToday's Halloween customs are thought to have been influenced by folk customs and beliefs from the Celtic-speaking countries, some of which are believed to have pagan roots [105] Jack Santino, a folklorist, writes that \"there was throughout Ireland an uneasy truce existing between customs and beliefs associated with Christianity and those associated with religions that were Irish before Christianity arrived\" [106] The origins of Halloween customs are typically linked to the Gaelic festival Samhain [107]\n\n\nSpread to North America\nLesley Bannatyne and Cindy Ott write that Anglican colonists in the southern United States and Catholic colonists in Maryland \"recognized All Hallows' Eve in their church calendars\", [141] [142] although the Puritans of New England strongly opposed the holiday, along with other traditional celebrations of the established Church, including Christmas [143] Almanacs of the late 18th and early 19th century give no indication that Halloween was widely celebrated in North America [26]\n\n\nSymbols\nDevelopment of artifacts and symbols associated with Halloween formed over time Jack-o'-lanterns are traditionally carried by guisers on All Hallows' Eve in order to frighten evil spirits [75] [148] There is a popular Irish Christian folktale associated with the jack-o'-lantern, [149] which in folklore is said to represent a \"soul who has been denied entry into both heaven and hell\": [150]\n\n\nTrick-or-treating and guising\nTrick-or-treating is a customary celebration for children on Halloween Children go in costume from house to house, asking for treats such as candy or sometimes money, with the question, \"Trick or treat?\" The word \"trick\" implies a \"threat\" to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given [66] The practice is said to have roots in the medieval practice of mumming, which is closely related to souling [165] John Pymm wrote that \"many of the feast days associated with the presentation of mumming plays were celebrated by the Christian Church.\" [166] These feast days included All Hallows' Eve, Christmas, Twelfth Night and Shrove Tuesday [167] [168] Mumming practiced in Germany, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe, [169] involved masked persons in fancy dress who \"paraded the streets and entered houses to dance or play dice in silence\" [170]\n\n\nCostumes\nHalloween costumes were traditionally modeled after figures such as vampires, ghosts, skeletons, scary looking witches, and devils [66] Over time, the costume selection extended to include popular characters from fiction, celebrities, and generic archetypes such as ninjas and princesses.\n\n\nPet costumes\nAccording to a 2018 report from the National Retail Federation, 30 million Americans will spend an estimated $480 million on Halloween costumes for their pets in 2018 This is up from an estimated $200 million in 2010 The most popular costumes for pets are the pumpkin, followed by the hot dog, and the bumblebee in third place [198]\n\n\nGames and other activities\nThere are several games traditionally associated with Halloween Some of these games originated as divination rituals or ways of foretelling one's future, especially regarding death, marriage and children During the Middle Ages, these rituals were done by a \"rare few\" in rural communities as they were considered to be \"deadly serious\" practices [199] In recent centuries, these divination games have been \"a common feature of the household festivities\" in Ireland and Britain [127] They often involve apples and hazelnuts In Celtic mythology, apples were strongly associated with the Otherworld and immortality, while hazelnuts were associated with divine wisdom [200] Some also suggest that they derive from Roman practices in celebration of Pomona [66]\n\n\nHaunted attractions\nHaunted attractions are entertainment venues designed to thrill and scare patrons Most attractions are seasonal Halloween businesses that may include haunted houses, corn mazes, and hayrides, [219] and the level of sophistication of the effects has risen as the industry has grown.\n\n\nFood\nOn All Hallows' Eve, many Western Christian denominations encourage abstinence from meat, giving rise to a variety of vegetarian foods associated with this day [236]\n\n\nChristian observances\nOn Hallowe'en (All Hallows' Eve), in Poland, believers were once taught to pray out loud as they walk through the forests in order that the souls of the dead might find comfort; in Spain, Christian priests in tiny villages toll their church bells in order to remind their congregants to remember the dead on All Hallows' Eve [245] In Ireland, and among immigrants in Canada, a custom includes the Christian practice of abstinence, keeping All Hallows' Eve as a meat-free day and serving pancakes or colcannon instead [246]\n\n\nAnalogous celebrations and perspectives\nAccording to Alfred J Kolatch in the Second Jewish Book of Why, in Judaism, Halloween is not permitted by Jewish Halakha because it violates Leviticus 18:3, which forbids Jews from partaking in Gentile customs Many Jews observe Yizkor communally four times a year, which is vaguely similar to the observance of Allhallowtide in Christianity, in the sense that prayers are said for both \"martyrs and for one's own family\" [277] Nevertheless, many American Jews celebrate Halloween, disconnected from its Christian origins [278] Reform Rabbi Jeffrey Goldwasser has said that \"There is no religious reason why contemporary Jews should not celebrate Halloween\" while Orthodox Rabbi Michael Broyde has argued against Jews' observing the holiday [279] Purim has sometimes been compared to Halloween, in part due to some observants wearing costumes, especially of Biblical figures described in the Purim narrative [280]\n\n\nJudaism\nAccording to Alfred J Kolatch in the Second Jewish Book of Why, in Judaism, Halloween is not permitted by Jewish Halakha because it violates

participation in Christmas, Easter, .. it is more sinful than congratulating the Christians for their prostration to the crucifix\" [281] It has also been ruled to be haram by the National Fatwa Council of Malaysia because of its alleged pagan roots stating \"Halloween is celebrated using a humorous theme mixed with horror to entertain and resist the spirit of death that influence humans\" [282] [283] Dar Al-Ifta Al-Missriyyah disagrees provided the celebration is not referred to as an 'eid' and that behaviour remains in line with Islamic principles [284]\n\n\nHinduism\nHindus remember the dead during the festival of Pitru Paksha, during which Hindus pay homage to and perform a ceremony \"to keep the souls of their ancestors at rest\" It is celebrated in the Hindu month of Bhadrapada, usually in mid-September [285] The celebration of the Hindu festival Diwali sometimes conflicts with the date of Halloween; but some Hindus choose to participate in the popular customs of

[287]\n\n\nNeopaganism\nThere is no consistent rule or view on Halloween amongst those who describe themselves as Neopagans or Wiccans Some Neopagans do not observe Halloween, but instead observe Samhain on 1 November, [288] some neopagans do enjoy Halloween festivities, stating that one can observe both \"the solemnity of Samhain in addition to the fun of Halloween\" Some neopagans are opposed to the celebration of Hallowe'en, stating that it \"trivializes Samhain\", [289] and \"avoid Halloween, because of the interruptions from trick or treaters\" [290] The Manitoban writes that \"Wiccans don't officially celebrate Halloween, despite the fact that 31 Oct will still have a star beside it in any good Wiccan's day planner Starting at sundown, Wiccans celebrate a holiday known as Samhain Samhain actually comes from old Celtic traditions and is not exclusive to Neopagan religions like Wicca While the traditions of this holiday originate in Celtic countries, modern day Wiccans don't try to historically replicate Samhain celebrations Some traditional Samhain rituals are still practised, but at its core, the period is treated as a time to celebrate darkness and the dead – a possible reason why Samhain can be confused with Halloween celebrations.\" [288]\n\n\nGeography\nThe traditions and importance of Halloween vary greatly among countries that observe it In Scotland and Ireland, traditional Halloween customs include children dressing up in costume going \"guising\", holding parties, while other practices in Ireland include lighting bonfires, and having firework displays [173] [291] [292] In Brittany children would play practical jokes by setting candles inside skulls in graveyards to frighten visitors [293] Mass transatlantic immigration in the 19th century

European population in Punjab feared the locals would overthrow British rule A nationwide hartal (strike action), which was called on 30 March (later changed to 6 April) by Mahatma Gandhi, had turned violent in some areas Authorities were also becoming concerned by displays of Hindu-Muslim unity [29]: 237  Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, decided to deport major agitators from the province One of those targeted was Dr Satyapal, [29]: 237  a Hindu who had served with the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War He advocated non-violent civil disobedience and was

magistrate, acting on orders from the Punjab government, had the two leaders arrested [29]: 237 \n\n\nEvents of 13 April\nThe event known historically as the Amritsar massacre occurred on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar The date coincided with that of the annual Baisakhi celebrations which are both a religious and a cultural festival of the Punjabis, and would have attracted visitors from outside the city On the morning of 13 April, Dyer issued a proclamation in English, Urdu and Punjabi at 19 locations around the city, and had handbills distributed, to the effect that a curfew was imposed, no processions were to take place, and that meetings of more than four individuals could be fired upon [31] By 12:30 that day, Dyer was informed that in defiance of his orders, a meeting was to be held in the Jallianwala Bagh [32]\n\n\nSubsequent events\nThe day after the massacre Dyer continued along confrontational lines, even though the city was quiet He met with a delegation of Amritsar citizens to whom he directed the following speech, without having received their petitions or heard from them Made to the delegation in Urdu, the English translation of a segment of Dyer's statement is shown below, as given in Collett's The Butcher of Amritsar: [46]\n\n\nReaction in Britain and British India\nA committee of inquiry, chaired by Lord Hunter, was established to investigate the massacre The committee's report criticised Dyer, arguing that in \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that Colonel Dyer committed a grave error.\" [51] Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified \"Colonel Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view,\" they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" [52] The Morning Post claimed Dyer was \"the man who saved India\" and started a benefit fund which raised over £26,000 sterling [53] Sources differ on how much, if anything Rudyard Kipling contributed to this fund and some sources claim that 'the man who saved India' line came from Kipling [54] [55] Michael O'Dwyer, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab from 1913 to 1919, endorsed Dyer and called the massacre a \"correct\" action [56] Some historians now believe he premeditated the massacre and set Dyer to work [57] [58] [59] [60] Many Indians blamed O'Dwyer, and while Dyer was never assaulted, O'Dwyer was assassinated in London in 1940 by an Indian revolutionary, Sardar Udham Singh in retaliation for his role in the massacre [61]\n\n\nDyer's response and motivation\nDyer wrote an article in the Globe of 21 January 1921, entitled, \"The Peril to the Empire\" It commenced with \"India does not want self-government She does not understand it.\" He wrote later that: [75]\n\n\nLater life\nChurchill, the then Secretary of State for War, wanted Dyer to be disciplined, but the Army Council superseded by him decided to allow Dyer to resign with no plan for further punishment Following Churchill's speech defending the council's decision and a debate in Parliament, on 8 July 1920 MPs voted for the government by a majority of 247 to 37; a motion calling for approval of Dyer's actions was defeated by a majority of 230 to 129 [82] [83]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDyer was portrayed by actor Edward Fox in the 1982 film Gandhi [93]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

at Full Sail University, managed XXXTentacion and his best friend Ski Mask the Slump God in 2016 [251] Due to Onfroy's inexperience in music and Tablez's inexperience in management, they agreed that

New Times journalist Tarpley Hitt, who conducted one of few mainstream media interviews with him, reflected that he spent most of the two-hour conversation speaking on the subject at the expense of answering questions on his childhood or criminal charges [346] Housemates from his time living with the pornographic actor Bruno Dickemz recalled that he had a collection of books on occult and took part in rituals [347] While living there, his former partner Geneva Ayala pretended to be demonically possessed as a way to scare him out of their turbulent relationship, but it instead fascinated him

Memorial Park, Boca Raton, Florida [1] [384]\n\n\nLegacy\nXXXTentacion's music was driven on themes revolving around depression and alienation, [385] becoming known for his \"depressing, and at times devastating\" [26] music that brought attention to mental health [386] He employed styles and techniques that were unconventional in hip hop during his career, such as distortion [387] and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals drawing inspiration from third-wave emo [388]\n\n\nControversy\nXXXTentacion's personal life and history are noted as prominent parts of his legacy [26] [389] [402] [27] An article in The Guardian described his legacy in more critical terms, stating that \"He will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse.\" [26] Mutual friends of both XXXTentacion and his ex-girlfriend dispute this narrative, recalling times when he had broken down in remorse [328] According to the article, his music \"reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people's and his own\" and rarely attempted to engage in bravado or bragging, instead focusing on \"mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny, and a prevailing feeling of numbness\", though acknowledging that XXXTentacion \"made some attempts to rehabilitate his image.\"

at Full Sail University, managed XXXTentacion and his best friend Ski Mask the Slump God in 2016 [251] Due to Onfroy's inexperience in music and Tablez's inexperience in management, they agreed that

video surfaced of Onfroy hitting a girl, Breonna Starling, in 2013 when he was 15 [280] Onfroy's attorneys claimed the video, which features a caption written by Starling that sardonically reads \"I hate this nigga\" along with Onfroy dancing to some music before striking the girl, was \"obviously    in jest\" [281]\n\n\nLeaked audio regarding domestic violence and a stabbing incident\nOn October

audio later released included moments after when Onfroy clarified in regards to his ex-girlfriend, \"I didn't touch her I forgave her.\" [290]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOnfroy had five half-siblings: four on his father's side—an older sister named Ariana, a younger brother named Corey, a younger brother named Givon, [295] and a sister named Ayla; and one on his mother's side—a younger brother named

allegedly posted scantily clad photos of her without her consent, though a fight never occurred [313] Ayala's at-the-time boyfriend alleged that she had punched and slapped him during breakdowns she had, though he admitted he had slapped her back occasionally to \"snap her out of it\" [314] Ayala's mother kicked her out when she was 16 and she had been living with her at-the-time boyfriend until they broke up In 2016, Ayala moved in with Onfroy and his roommates [315]\n\n\nReligious and spiritual beliefs\nOnfroy, who was raised a Christian, had a well-documented interest in the occult Miami New Times journalist Tarpley Hitt, who conducted one of few mainstream media interviews with him, reflected that he spent most of the two-hour conversation speaking on the subject at the expense of answering questions on his childhood or criminal charges [346] Housemates from his time living with the pornographic actor Bruno Dickemz recalled that he had a collection of books on occult and took part in rituals [347] While living there, his former partner Geneva Ayala pretended to be demonically possessed as a way to scare him out of their turbulent relationship, but it instead fascinated him [348] He was inspired by Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy philosophy and its teachings about consciousness [349]\n\n\nPolitics\nOnfroy was public about his political and personal beliefs throughout his career In 2016, Onfroy opposed the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump and had instead signaled support for Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders [291] [354] He also took to Twitter predicting a Trump victory, saying, \"As much as I hate that piece of shit Donald Trump, y'all know this motherfucker's gonna win right?\" [355] He also stated that, although he did not hold a positive opinion of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, describing her as \"garbage\", he did not want Trump to win because, \"Once Trump gets in it's over for all the minorities pretty much.. the lower classes are gonna be fucked.\" His songs \"Hate Will Never Win\" and \"Suicide Pit\" contain anti-Trump lyrics [356] [357]\n\n\nMurder and trial\nAt 3:56 p.m EDT on June 18, 2018, Onfroy, upon leaving Riva Motorsports Motorcycle & Marine Superstore in Deerfield Beach, Florida, was blocked from exiting the parking lot by a black Dodge Journey SUV in a premeditated attack Two armed men exited the SUV and approached the rapper while he was sitting in the driver's seat A brief struggle occurred and the armed men reached inside Onfroy's vehicle, stole a small Louis Vuitton bag containing US$50,000 and shot Onfroy multiple times The shooters fled the scene in their SUV Onfroy was taken by paramedics to the nearby Broward Health North hospital in Deerfield Beach, where he was pronounced dead [38] [370]\n\n\nFuneral\nAn open casket service for Onfroy took place at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida, on June 27, 2018, where fans were allowed to pay their respects [381] [382] His private funeral took place on June 28, 2018, where rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yachty and singer Erykah Badu were among the attendees [383] He was entombed in a mausoleum at Gardens of Boca Raton Memorial Park, Boca Raton, Florida [1] [384]\n\n\nLegacy\nXXXTentacion's music was driven on themes revolving around depression and alienation, [385] becoming known for his \"depressing, and at times devastating\" [26] music that brought attention to mental health [386] He employed styles and techniques that were unconventional in hip hop during his career, such as distortion [387] and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals drawing inspiration from third-wave emo [388]\n\n\nControversy\nXXXTentacion's personal life and history are noted as prominent parts of his legacy [26] [389] [402] [27] An article in The Guardian described his legacy in more critical terms, stating that \"He will be remembered mostly for the unusually cruel violence he committed on vulnerable people, particularly his ex-girlfriend, crimes for which he never expressed remorse.\" [26] Mutual friends of both XXXTentacion and his ex-girlfriend dispute this narrative, recalling times when he had broken down in remorse [328] According to the article, his music \"reflected a life lived with disregard for humanity, both other people's and his own\" and rarely attempted to engage in bravado or bragging, instead focusing on \"mental illness, suicide, extreme misogyny, and a prevailing feeling of numbness\", though acknowledging that XXXTentacion \"made some attempts to rehabilitate his image.\"

the national level, elections were held in 272 constituencies, each electing one member to the National Assembly At the provincial level, elections were held in each of the four provinces to elect

national level, elections were held in 272 constituencies, each electing one member to the National Assembly At the provincial level, elections were held in each of the four provinces to elect Members of the Provincial Assemblies (MPA) [25]\n\n\n2022 constitutional crisis\nOn 8 March 2022, the opposition parties, under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), submitted a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan to the National Assembly's secretariat [28] [29] On 27 March 2022, Khan waved a diplomatic cypher from US in the public, [30] claiming that it demanded the removal of Khan's government in a coup [31] Later he changed his stance about the US conspiracy against his government, in an effort to mend ties with the country [32] [33] However, in August 2023, The Intercept claimed to have published the contents of the diplomatic cable which had American diplomat Donald Lu on record as stating that \"all will be forgiven\" concerning the country's neutrality in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, if the no-confidence motion against Khan were to succeed [34] After the election, JUI-F president Fazal-ur-Rehman, a critic of Imran Khan, claimed that the motion of no-confidence to remove Khan was introduced on the instructions of former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa [35] [36]\n\n\nPDM government\nAfter the success of the no-confidence motion, on 11 April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif became the Prime Minister after receiving 174 votes out of a total of 342, two more than the required majority with the support of the Pakistan People's Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and various smaller parties under the coalition of the PDM Dissident members of PTI also supported his candidature Meanwhile, the remaining PTI members, who were now in the opposition, boycotted the session terming it a continuation of a \"foreign conspiracy\" [48] A day later, over 100 PTI members tendered resignations from their National Assembly seats [49]\n\n\nAssassination attempt on Imran Khan and his subsequent arrest\nFollowing its ouster from the government, PTI continued to enjoy mass popularity with its supporters taking to the streets across the country [53] In July 2022, during a provincial by-election in Punjab, the party had a landslide victory after winning 15 of the 20 seats During October 2022 by-elections conducted for the National Assembly, the party won 7 out of 9 seats with Khan winning 6 of the 7 seats he was contesting for [54] Later in the year, Khan himself led a well-attended march of protest throughout the populous province of Punjab, to force an early general election [55] However, on 3 November 2022, while he was leading the march through Wazirabad, he was shot at and injured in an attempted assassination [56]\n\n\nSchedule controversies\nIn January 2023, in a bid to force early general elections, the PTI prematurely dissolved the provincial assemblies it was in power in – namely Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa According to the constitution of Pakistan, after the dissolution of an assembly, elections are supposed to be held there within 90 days, thus, constitutionally limiting the date for the two provincial elections to be no later than April 2023 [66] [67] However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) delayed the elections to October 2023, citing lack of funds provided by the PDM government and the unavailability of the required security personnel [68] [69] The PTI approached the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the electoral body's decision, terming it a violation of the constitution, and with a majority verdict the court declared the ECP's earlier ruling as unconstitutional and ordered it to hold elections by 14 May 2023 [70] After the nationwide May 9 riots that broke out following Imran Khan's arrest – the election date passed without the Supreme Court order being enforced On 30 May, after the passage of a new law, the PDM government filed a review petition against the court's earlier ruling [71]\n\n\nReturn of Nawaz Sharif to electoral politics\nAt the start of May 2023, the PDM government adopted a law allowing for filing review petitions against prior Supreme Court verdicts.to [80] At the end of June, another law, limiting disqualification to five years, was adopted It also allows the electoral commission to announce the date of an election without consulting the President of the country [81]\n\n\nCampaign\nOn 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against allowing the PTI to keep its electoral symbol, asserting that the party had failed to conduct intra-party elections to the commission's satisfaction Subsequently, on the same day, the PTI appealed to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) challenging the ECP's decision Consequently, a single-member bench suspended the ECP's order until 9 January 2024 On 30 December 2023, the ECP submitted a review application to the PHC In the following days, a two-member bench lifted the suspension order while hearing the case However, on 10 January 2024, the two-member bench deemed the ECP's order \"illegal, without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect.\" Responding to this, on 11 January, the ECP contested the ruling in the Supreme Court [88]\n\n\nPTI de facto ban through intra-party election verdict\nOn 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against allowing the PTI to keep its electoral symbol, asserting that the party had failed to conduct intra-party elections to the commission's satisfaction Subsequently, on the same day, the PTI appealed to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) challenging the ECP's decision Consequently, a single-member bench suspended the ECP's order until 9 January 2024 On 30 December 2023, the ECP submitted a review application to the PHC In the following days, a two-member bench lifted the suspension order while hearing the case However, on 10 January 2024, the two-member bench deemed the ECP's order \"illegal, without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect.\" Responding to this, on 11 January, the ECP contested the ruling in the Supreme Court [88]\n\n\nImran Khan's convictions\nIn the week before the elections, Imran Khan was sentenced to jail terms in three separate cases On 30 January 2024, with the government seeking a death penalty, he was sentenced to 10 years in a case dealing with the handling of state secrets by Judge Abul Hasnat Zulqarnain [93] A day later, Judge Muhammad Bashir, sentenced him and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to a jail term of 14 years, along with a fine of Rs. 787 million (US$2.7 million) each for retaining a jewellery set that was a state gift from Saudi Arabia against an undervalued assessment from the country's Toshakhana The ruling also barred Khan from holding public office for 10 years [94] Two days later, Judge Qudratullah declared the marriage of Khan and his wife against Islamic law and sentenced both to prison for a term of seven years for allegedly solemnising their marriage during Bushra's Iddah period The case was lodged on the complaint of Khawar Maneka, Bushra's former husband, five years after her marriage to Khan [95]\n\n\nAllegations of pre-poll rigging\nSome observers, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, have pointed to what appears to be pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the upcoming elections There have been notable actions against the PTI and its leaders, including snatching of nomination papers, arbitrary arrests of candidates and their supporters, systematic rejection of nomination papers, and disruption of campaign events This situation has led to widespread allegations of 'election engineering' and manipulative practices that could potentially favour certain political groups, casting doubts over the fairness of the electoral process [106] [103] [107] [108] Pakistan's electoral commission was also accused of gerrymandering in favour of the PML-N during the redrawing of voter maps before the elections, with a record 1,300 complaints made [109]\n\n\nAppointment of bureaucrats as electoral officers\nFor the first time in Pakistan's electoral history since 1985, Chief Electoral Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja employed the services of the highly politicized [116] executive bureaucracy, particularly Assistant Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, in the key electoral roles of Returning Officers (RO) and District Returning Officers (DRO) [117] These ROs and DROs are engaged in all stages of the electoral process: from screening applicants to consolidation of vote counts, and, finally, provisionally notifying winning candidates [118] Traditionally, these posts have been occupied by the lower judiciary of the country [119]\n\n\nCensorship\nOn 26 January 2024, PTI's official website, insaf.pk, and a separate website made for disseminating information regarding the individual electoral symbols of the party's candidates were blocked in Pakistan [127] A voter helpline created by the party was also blocked [128] Previously, social media was blocked in the country during the party's virtual electoral events on at least three separate occasions as per internet watchdog, NetBlocks [129] [130]\n\n\nElection day violence and disruptions\nWidespread internet disruption, with complete closure of mobile phone networks, was observed and condemned by Amnesty International as a blunt attack on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly [132] On 6 March, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) admitted in its response to the Sindh High Court (SHC) that the Ministry of Interior had indeed issued directives to suspend mobile phone services on the election day on 8 February, due to security concerns and fear of terror related activities [133]\n\n\nElectoral system\nThe 336 members of the National Assembly consist of 266 general seats elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies, [137] 60 seats that are reserved for women elected by proportional representation based on the number of general seats won by each party in each province, and ten seats that are reserved for non-Muslims elected through proportional representation based on the number of overall general seats won by each party Independents cannot claim reserved seats [138] [139]\n\n\nVoting and transmission of results\nRegistered voters in each polling station of an electoral district get two paper ballots to put a stamp on their preferred candidate for the national and provincial assembly respectively These ballots are then counted by a presiding officer who then transmits the results for their polling station to the returning officer (RO) in Form 45 Copies of Form 45 are also given to the observing polling agents of the contesting candidates The RO then consolidates these Form 45s, in front of the contesting candidates of the constituency they are overseeing, to give a provisional result in Form 47 before doing a final consolidation in Form 48 The ECP then uses the data from Forms 47 and 48 to officially notify elected members for each constituency using Form 49, provided that no candidate contested the unofficial consolidated counts given in Form 48 [142]\n\n\nTimeline\nIn July 2023 the ECP invited political parties to submit applications for the allocation of electoral symbols, [143] given that about 40% of the Pakistani population is illiterate [144]\n\n\nParties\nThe table below lists each party that either received a share of the vote higher than 0.5% in the 2018 Pakistan general election or had representation in the 15th National Assembly of Pakistan Political parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2018 elections Independent candidates received 11.46% of the vote and 13 national assembly seats (both general seats and total seats in the 15th National Assembly, as reserved seats for women and minorities, are given to political parties) in 2018 [citation needed]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nIn August 2023, the ECP imposed a total ban on entrance and exit polls including those on official digital media accounts of electronic and print media outlets [154] Before the ban, opinion polling in June 2023 by Gallup Pakistan, the Institute of Public Opinion Research (IPOR) and IRIS showed that the PML-N had regained its lead over the PTI especially in the country's largest province, Punjab [citation needed]\n\n\nSecurity concerns and violence\nThe ECP categorised half the country's 90,675 polling stations as either \"sensitive\", meaning there is a risk of violence, or \"most sensitive\", indicating a higher risk The classifications were based on the area's security situation and history of electoral violence [155] In Balochistan Province alone, caretaker provincial home minister Muhammad Zubair Jamali said that almost 80% of its 5,028 polling stations had been declared \"sensitive\" [156]\n\n\nPre-poll violence\nOn 25 January 2024, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan pledged not to stage attacks on election rallies and would limit itself to attacking military and police targets during the election period This followed the government's decision to deploy troops in sensitive constituencies after intelligence agencies warned that militants could target rallies [157]\n\n\nIncidents on election day\nThe Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the closure of its borders with Iran and Afghanistan on the eve of the general elections on 8 February, as a measure to enhance security [161] [162]\n\n\nPost-election violence\nOn 9 February, two PTI workers were killed and 24 others were injured after clashes broke out between police and PTI supporters demonstrating against alleged electoral fraud in Shangla District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [165] [166] On 10 February, Mohsin Dawar, the leader of the National Democratic Movement who was running for a national assembly seat in North Waziristan, was seriously injured in a gun attack in Miranshah [167] On 11 February, six people, including a police officer, were killed and five others were injured in election-related clashes in Larkana [168] On 12 February, Chaudhry Muhammad Adnan, a former PTI member of the Punjab Assembly and Independent candidate for the NA-57 Rawalpindi-VI and PP-19 Rawalpindi-XIII constituencies in Punjab, was shot dead in Rawalpindi [169] On 13 February, three people were killed and five others were injured in a gun attack on a PPP victory rally in Dera Ismail Khan [170] On 14 February, two people were killed and 13 others were injured in clashes between BAP and PPP supporters during a recount outside the office of the returning officer in Hub, Balochistan [171]\n\n\nResults\nThe election was postponed in the NA-8 Bajaur constituency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to the killing of candidate Rehan Zaib Khan Provincial assembly elections were also postponed in the constituencies of PK-22 and PK-91 (both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) due to the deaths of candidates there [172]\n\n\nNational Assembly\nThe election was postponed in the NA-8 Bajaur constituency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to the killing of candidate Rehan Zaib Khan Provincial assembly elections were also postponed in the constituencies of PK-22 and PK-91 (both in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) due to the deaths of candidates there [172]\n\n\nAllegations of rigging\nThe election saw delays in the reporting of results across thousands of polling stations, sparking controversy Initial reports suggested PTI-backed candidates were leading, [10] but the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refuted these claims [173] Instances of alleged tampering emerged, including significant discrepancies in vote counts and unexpected shifts in results [174] [175] [176] PTI officials accused the ECP of manipulation and initiated legal challenges [177] [178] [179] Concerns grew as delays persisted, with accusations of internet shutdowns aimed at impeding opposition efforts [180] [112] PTI leaders contested official results, claiming widespread irregularities and fabrications, prompting legal action and calls for resignations within the ECP [181] [182] Revelations of electoral fraud surfaced, including admissions from officials implicated in rigging [183] Despite retractions, [184] doubts lingered, leading to urgent calls for investigations by election monitoring groups like the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) [185] The Pakistan Institute of

from 81 foreign journalists and 38 international observers Visa applications were processed, and accreditation was made mandatory for foreign observers upon arrival in Pakistan [239] Eligible applicants were in the process of being approved with visas [240] [241] The Pakistan High Commission in London issued visas to 37 British journalists, including prominent figures such as Christina Lamb of The Times, allowing them to cover the election proceedings in Pakistan [242]\n\n\nAftermath\nProtests were held by the PTI and other parties in cities across Pakistan to protest alleged electoral fraud Dozens were arrested following protests in Lahore while highways were blocked in Balochistan [249] On 14 February, the JUI-F's leader Fazal-ur-Rehman said that he rejected the election

Pakistan (JI) party to lead a government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Khan had previously said that he would not engage with the PML-N's Nawaz Sharif and the PPP's Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, calling them \"corrupt\" [262] On 14 February, the JI rejected the proposed coalition with the PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing a change in the latter's stance over the formation of the provincial government, as the PTI only offered a coalition at the provincial level, not nationally [263] [264]\n\n\nInauguration of the National Assembly\nPresident Arif Alvi declined to convene the National Assembly's inaugural session, which is typically summoned within 21 days of the general elections as per the constitution He was also of the view that Assembly was not complete and therefore the ECP should distribute the reserved seats for women and minorities to the PTI-backed SIC bloc As a result, he faced significant criticism from the PPP and the PML-N [292] [293] who asserted that the President's action amounts to \"abrogating the Constitution\" by not convening the session, and warned of potential legal consequences [294] Imran Khan also endorsed Alvi's decision to decline the summoning of the session and said that they were drafting a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), [295] urging for the condition that any of its discussions with the incoming PML-N/PPP coalition government should be contingent upon an independent audit of the general election [296] This action was heavily criticized by the PML-N and the PPP, who argued that sending such a letter would be tantamount to inviting foreign intervention in the country's domestic affairs [297] On 28 February, the National Assembly Secretariat scheduled the inaugural session for 29 February at 10 a.m., bypassing the need for notification from Alvi [298] At the very last moment, Alvi relented and approved a summary for calling the inaugural session late at night, albeit with reservations about the

(PKMAP) leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai who was also a presidential candidate in the 2024 Pakistani presidential election contesting against PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari The PKMAP claimed that the raid was a reaction following a speech delivered by Achakzai in the National Assembly [322] where he criticized the \"establishment\" for their interference in the polls [323] [324] On 8 March, Achakzai, in a letter to the ECP requested the postponement of the presidential elections, citing concerns that holding elections without reserved seats in the assemblies would be unconstitutional However, the ECP dismissed Achakzai's request [325]\n\n\nFormation of provincial governments\nOn 23 February 2024, the 18th Punjab Assembly convened approximately 313 newly elected MPAs were sworn in This included

election was held on 25 July 2018, in which the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) won a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, led by Imran Khan as the Prime Minister. However, the PTI government faced a constitutional crisis in 2022 after a no-confidence motion was submitted against Prime Minister Imran Khan, leading to his ouster and the formation of a new government led by Shehbaz Sharif.\n\n**2022 Constitutional Crisis**\n\nOn 8 March 2022, the opposition parties, under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), submitted a motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan to the National Assembly's secretariat. The motion was supported by various opposition parties, including the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F). Khan responded by claiming that the motion was a conspiracy against his government, backed by the United States.\n\n**PDM Government**\n\nAfter the success of the no-confidence motion, Shehbaz Sharif became the Prime Minister on 11 April 2022, with the support of the PPP, JUI-F, and various smaller parties under the coalition of the PDM. The PTI dissident members also supported his candidature. The remaining PTI members, who were now in the opposition, boycotted the session, terming it a continuation of a \"foreign conspiracy.\"\n\n**Assassination Attempt on Imran Khan**\n\nFollowing its ouster from the government, the PTI continued to enjoy mass popularity with its supporters taking to the streets across the country. In July 2022, the party had a landslide victory in a provincial by-election in Punjab. Later in the year, Khan himself led a well-attended march of protest throughout the populous province of Punjab, to force an early general election. However, on 3 November 2022, while leading the march through Wazirabad, Khan was shot at and injured in an attempted assassination.\n\n**Schedule Controversies**\n\nIn January 2023, the PTI prematurely dissolved the provincial assemblies it was in power in – namely Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The PTI approached the Supreme Court against the electoral body's decision, terming it a violation of the constitution. The court declared the ECP's earlier ruling as unconstitutional and ordered it to hold elections by 14 May 2023.\n\n**Return of Nawaz Sharif to Electoral Politics**\n\nAt the start of May 2023, the PDM government adopted a law allowing for filing review petitions against prior Supreme Court verdicts. Later in the month, another law was adopted limiting disqualification to five years and allowing the electoral commission to announce the date of an election without consulting the President of the country.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nOn 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against allowing the PTI to keep its electoral symbol, asserting that the party had failed to conduct intra-party elections to the commission's satisfaction. The PTI appealed to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) challenging the ECP's decision.\n\n**Imran Khan's Convictions**\n\nIn the week before the elections, Imran Khan was sentenced to jail terms in three separate cases. On 30 January 2024, he was sentenced to 10 years in a case dealing with the handling of state secrets. A day later, he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to a jail term of 14 years, along with a fine of Rs. 787 million (US$2.7 million) each for retaining a jewelry set that was a state gift from Saudi Arabia against an undervalued assessment.\n\n**Allegations of Pre-Poll Rigging**\n\nSome observers, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, have pointed to what appears to be pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the upcoming elections. There have been notable actions against the PTI and its leaders, including snatching of nomination papers, arbitrary arrests of candidates and their supporters, systematic rejection of nomination papers, and disruption of campaign events.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe 336 members of the National Assembly consist of 266 general seats elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies, 60 seats that are reserved for women elected by proportional representation based on the number of general seats won by each party in each province, and ten seats that are reserved for non-Muslims elected through proportional representation based on the number of overall general seats won by each party.\n\n**Voting and Transmission of Results**\n\nRegistered voters in each polling station of an electoral district get two paper ballots to put a stamp on their preferred candidate for the national and provincial assembly, respectively. These ballots are then counted by a presiding officer who then transmits the results for their polling station to the returning officer (RO) in Form 45.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nIn July 2023, the ECP invited political parties to submit applications for the allocation of electoral symbols. About 40% of the Pakistani population is illiterate.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nIn August 2023, the ECP imposed a total ban on entrance and exit polls, including those on official digital media accounts of electronic and print media outlets. Before the ban, opinion polling in June 2023 by Gallup Pakistan, the Institute of Public Opinion Research (IPOR), and IRIS showed that the PML-N had regained its lead over the PTI, especially in the country's largest province, Punjab.\n\n**International Analysis**\n\nMedia outlets around the world denounced the election as \"fraudulent\" with western media characterizing the election as already decided, favoring the military-backed candidate Nawaz Sharif.\n\n**International Observers**\n\nIn October 2023, the ECP issued invitations to foreign election observers, emphasizing transparency in the election process. Before the elections, Pakistan received visa applications from 81 foreign journalists and 38 international observers.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nProtests were held by the PTI and other parties in cities across Pakistan to protest alleged electoral fraud.

constitutionally limiting the date for the two provincial elections to be no later than April 2023 [66] [67] However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) delayed the elections to October 2023, citing lack of funds provided by the PDM government and the unavailability of the required security personnel [68] [69] The PTI approached the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the electoral body's decision, terming it a violation of the constitution, and with a majority verdict the court declared the ECP's earlier ruling as unconstitutional and ordered it to hold elections by 14 May 2023 [70]

political groups, casting doubts over the fairness of the electoral process [106] [103] [107] [108] Pakistan's electoral commission was also accused of gerrymandering in favour of the PML-N during the

to give a provisional result in Form 47 before doing a final consolidation in Form 48 The ECP then uses the data from Forms 47 and 48 to officially notify elected members for each constituency using Form 49, provided that no candidate contested the unofficial consolidated counts given in Form 48 [142]\n\n\nTimeline\nIn July 2023 the ECP invited political parties to submit applications for the

its lead over the PTI especially in the country's largest province, Punjab [citation needed]\n\n\nSecurity concerns and violence\nThe ECP categorised half the country's 90,675 polling stations as either \"sensitive\", meaning there is a risk of violence, or \"most sensitive\", indicating a higher risk The classifications were based on the area's security situation and history of electoral violence [155] In Balochistan Province alone, caretaker provincial home minister Muhammad Zubair Jamali said that almost 80% of its 5,028 polling stations had been declared \"sensitive\" [156]\n\n\nPre-poll violence\nOn 25 January 2024, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan pledged not to stage attacks on election rallies and would limit itself to attacking military and police targets during

[172]\n\n\nAllegations of rigging\nThe election saw delays in the reporting of results across thousands of polling stations, sparking controversy Initial reports suggested PTI-backed candidates were leading, [10] but the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) refuted these claims [173] Instances of alleged tampering emerged, including significant discrepancies in vote counts and unexpected shifts in results [174] [175] [176] PTI officials accused the ECP of manipulation and initiated legal challenges [177] [178] [179] Concerns grew as delays persisted, with accusations of internet shutdowns aimed at impeding opposition efforts [180] [112] PTI leaders contested official results, claiming widespread irregularities and fabrications, prompting legal action and calls for resignations within the ECP [181] [182] Revelations of electoral fraud surfaced, including admissions from officials implicated in rigging [183] Despite retractions, [184] doubts lingered, leading to urgent calls for investigations by election monitoring groups like the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) [185] The Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) underscored declining fairness in its independent evaluation of the election, advocating for a thorough investigation by the ECP to address systemic issues [186]\n\n\nDisinformation\nRumors spread on social media claiming that international media outlets had reported the PTI winning over 150 seats However, a fact-check conducted by iVerify found no evidence to support these claims [208]\n\n\nExit polling\nGallup Pakistan's exit poll survey indicated that the PTI garnered significant support from educated youth, with 41 percent of its voters being high school-educated individuals aged 18 to 24 or older Conversely, the PML-N and the PPP received more backing from illiterate and middle-pass voters Among bachelor's and master's degree holders, 35% supported the PTI, 15% favored the PML-N, and 10% supported the PPP Meanwhile, the PML-N secured 29% of votes from illiterate voters, compared to the PPP's 23% and the PTI's 21% Among middle-pass voters, 31% voted for the PML-N, 26% for the PTI, and 15% for the PPP, as per the survey findings [210]\n\n\nInternational analysis\nMedia outlets around the world denounced the election as \"fraudulent\" [18] with western media characterized the election as already decided, favoring the military-backed candidate Nawaz Sharif [114]\n\n\nReruns\nThe ECP ordered elections to be held again on 15 February in twenty-six polling stations of the NA-88 Khushab-II constituency in Punjab after a mob destroyed election materials at the office of the returning officer Due to security issues re-polling was ordered in six polling stations of NA-43 Tank-cum-Dera Ismail Khan constituency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to be held on 17 February Elections were also ordered repeated in the provincial assembly constituencies in PS-18 Ghotki-I in Sindh and PK-90 Kohat-I in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after election materials were either stolen or destroyed [236] [237]\n\n\nInternational observers\nIn October 2023, the ECP issued invitations to foreign election observers, emphasizing transparency in the election process [238] Before the elections, Pakistan received visa applications from 81 foreign journalists and 38 international observers Visa applications were processed, and accreditation was made mandatory for foreign observers upon arrival in Pakistan [239] Eligible applicants were in the process of being approved with visas [240] [241] The Pakistan High Commission in London issued visas to 37 British journalists, including prominent figures such as Christina Lamb of The Times, allowing them to cover the election proceedings in Pakistan [242]\n\n\nAftermath\nProtests were held by the PTI and other parties in cities across Pakistan to protest alleged electoral fraud Dozens were arrested following protests in Lahore while highways were blocked in Balochistan [249] On 14 February, the JUI-F's leader Fazal-ur-Rehman said that he rejected the election results and announced that his party would stage protests against the ECP [250] Awami National Party provincial president for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Aimal Wali Khan in a press conference rejected the results of the elections, claiming they were already decided before voting began He admitted their past cooperation with the establishment was a mistake and vowed not to work with them anymore He also accused the military of using the country's resources for their benefit [251]\n\n\nFormation of a new federal government\nOn 10 February, in an AI-generated victory speech from prison, Imran Khan claimed that based on completed forms provided by polling agents, his party had won a two-thirds majority [260] [261] On 13 February, the PTI announced that it would try and form a government through its affiliated independent candidates in the national level and in Punjab with the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM) party It also said that it would seek to form a coalition with the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan (JI) party to lead a government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Khan had previously said that he would not engage with the PML-N's Nawaz Sharif and the PPP's Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, calling them \"corrupt\" [262] On 14 February, the JI rejected the proposed coalition with the PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing a change in the latter's stance over the formation of the provincial government, as the PTI only offered a coalition at the provincial level, not nationally [263] [264]\n\n\nInauguration of the National Assembly\nPresident Arif Alvi declined to convene the National Assembly's inaugural session, which is typically summoned within 21 days of the general elections as per the constitution He was also of the view that Assembly was not complete and therefore the ECP should distribute the reserved seats for women and minorities to the PTI-backed SIC bloc As a result, he faced significant criticism from the PPP and the PML-N [292] [293] who asserted that the President's action amounts to \"abrogating the Constitution\" by not convening the session, and warned of potential legal consequences [294] Imran Khan also endorsed Alvi's decision to decline the summoning of the session and said that they were drafting a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), [295] urging for the condition that any of its discussions with the incoming PML-N/PPP coalition government should be contingent upon an independent audit of the general election [296] This action was heavily criticized by the PML-N and the PPP, who argued that sending such a letter would be tantamount to inviting foreign intervention in the country's domestic affairs [297] On 28 February, the National Assembly Secretariat scheduled the inaugural session for 29 February at 10 a.m., bypassing the need for notification from Alvi [298] At the very last moment, Alvi relented and approved a summary for calling the inaugural session late at night, albeit with reservations about the tone of the summary from caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar [299]\n\n\nElection of the Prime Minister\nOn 2 March, Shehbaz Sharif of the PML-N and PTI-backed independent candidate Omar Ayub Khan submitted their nomination papers for the prime ministerial elections [314] The next day on 3 March, Shehbaz was re-elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time, securing 201 votes against the 92 votes received by Omar Ayub Khan Due to the absence of a clear majority for any single party in the assembly, Shehbaz was elected with the joint support from PML-N's allies such as the PPP, MQM-P, PML-Q, BAP, PML-Z, IPP, NP among others [315] [24] [316] He would soon afterwards be officially sworn in [317] During the session, PTI-backed SIC MNAs chanted slogans alleging that Shehbaz came to power through rigging [318] with Omar Ayub terming the Shahbaz' PM election as 'illegal' Omar Ayub Khan also condemned censorship in his speech after the state-run Pakistan Television Corporation was reported to have abruptly ceased live broadcasting as soon as he had started to speak, comparing it with live coverage of Shehbaz's statements [319] [320]\n\n\nElection of the President\nThe coalition agreement which was reached also called for Asif Ali Zardari to return as President of Pakistan [317] On 3 March, the police conducted a raid on Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PKMAP) leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai who was also a presidential candidate in the 2024 Pakistani presidential election contesting against PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari The PKMAP claimed that the raid was a reaction following a speech delivered by Achakzai in the National Assembly [322] where he criticized the \"establishment\" for their interference in the polls [323] [324] On 8 March, Achakzai, in a letter to the ECP requested the postponement of the presidential elections, citing concerns that holding elections without reserved seats in the assemblies would be unconstitutional However, the ECP dismissed Achakzai's request [325]\n\n\nFormation of provincial governments\nOn 23 February 2024, the 18th Punjab Assembly convened approximately 313 newly elected MPAs were sworn in This included 193 from the PML-N, 98 PTI-backed independents, 13 from the PPP, 10 from the PML-Q, five from the IPP, and one each from the TLP and the PML-Z [328] On 26 February, Nawaz Sharif's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, was elected as the first female chief minister of Punjab with 220 votes in the assembly, [329] while her opponent PTI-backed candidate Rana Aftab Ahmad Khan boycotted the elections [330] The next day, the PTI announced that it would convene a separate Punjab Assembly session to select its chief minister, speaker, and deputy speaker, asserting a majority with 250 MPAs, including those from reserved seats for women and minorities They labeled the election of Maryam Nawaz to the chief ministership \"a stolen mandate\" and asserted that she was defeated on her provincial assembly seat from PP-159 Lahore-XV by a PTI-backed candidate, Mehr Sharafat [331]\n\n\nReactions\nAfter polling closed, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said that the elections were a \"momentous occasion\" He praised the enthusiasm of the people of Pakistan and expressed appreciation for their participation in the polling process, adding that \"the high voter turnout is a clear indication of public commitment to shaping the future of our country.\" [339]\n\n\nDomestic\nAfter polling closed,

participation in the polling process, adding that \"the high voter turnout is a clear indication of public commitment to shaping the future of our country.\" [339]\n\n\nInternational\nFollowing the

[2] After a friend of Rodrigo and producer Dan Nigro suggested Nigro listen to Rodrigo's songs on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: The Soundtrack (2020), he was \"just completely blown away\" and reached out to Rodrigo via Instagram, offering to work with her The pair had a meeting to get to know one another, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the United States They started collaborating after figuring out ways to work safely in isolation [3] [4] She released her debut single \"Drivers License\", produced by Nigro, on January 8, 2021, to unprecedented commercial and critical success Billboard declared the single one of the most dominant number-one songs in Hot 100 history [5]\n\n\nConception\n\nRodrigo's goal for her debut project, Sour, was to create a multifaceted body of work that blends mainstream pop, folk, and alternative rock genres, [12] as well as elements of pop-punk, country, and grunge [13] According to Rodrigo, the album was inspired by the works of her favorite singer-songwriters, including Alanis Morissette, Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, [14] and the \"pouty\", \"angsty\" sound of rock acts No Doubt and the White Stripes [15] She also cited her mother's musical tastes as an influence, as she introduced a young Rodrigo to metal, punk, and 1990s alternative rock [10]\n\nMusic and lyrics\nSour has been described as a genre-hopping pop, [19] pop-punk, [20] alternative pop, [21] [22] and bedroom pop [23] record with synth-pop, dream pop, alternative rock, pop rock, and folk-pop elements [24] [25] [26]  Stylistically, the album spans from energetic 1990s-inspired guitar rock to tender acoustic balladry driven by piano and fingerpicked guitars [27] [28] Craig Jenkins of Vulture categorized Sour as a \"post-genre\" record, one which materializes Rodrigo's aim to transcend boundaries of music genres and coalesce them [26] The songs of Sour represent different perspectives to a single storyline of failed romance The songwriting is characterized by self-aware [27] themes of insecurities, anger, revenge, envy, and jealousy, using detail-specific lyrics exuding vulnerability [29] [30] [28]\n\n\nSongs\nSour opens with \"Brutal\", which Rodrigo described as \"angsty\" and \"uptempo\" Music critics characterize the track as an enjoyable, \"angrily insecure alt-rock tirade\" and \"playful and easy pop-punk\" that \"free falls into the depths of grungy rock\", with elements of indie rock [31] [32] [33] [34] \"Brutal\" was the last song written for the album; Rodrigo and Nigro wrote the track two weeks before she had to turn in the record Rodrigo noted that the song represents her teenage years [35] The song has \"thrashy\" guitars, and was reported to be a \"desire to defy any pop expectations that have been placed upon  [Rodrigo] by fans, friends, executives, or exes\" [24] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic described the guitar riff on \"Brutal\" as \"scary in the manner of Clinton-era Nine Inch Nails\" [36] \"Traitor\", the second track, is an indie pop ballad with a folk instrumental [37] [38] Its lyrics have been described to consist of \"post-grief anger and bargaining\" [24] Furthermore, details on the lyrics also depict Rodrigo's ex moving on with another girl while she is unable to get over it as she tries to figure out what went wrong

Olivia Rodrigo signed to Geffen Records, intending to release her debut EP the following year [2] After a friend of Rodrigo and producer Dan Nigro suggested Nigro listen to Rodrigo's songs on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: The Soundtrack (2020), he was \"just completely blown away\" and reached out to Rodrigo via Instagram, offering to work with her The pair had a meeting to get to know one another, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the United States They started collaborating after figuring out ways to work safely in isolation [3] [4] She released her debut single \"Drivers License\", produced by Nigro, on January 8, 2021, to unprecedented commercial and critical success Billboard declared the single one of the most dominant number-one songs in Hot 100 history [5]\n\n\nConception\n\nRodrigo's goal for her debut project, Sour, was to create a multifaceted body of work that blends mainstream pop, folk, and alternative rock genres, [12] as well as elements of pop-punk, country, and grunge [13] According to Rodrigo, the album was inspired by the works of her favorite singer-songwriters, including Alanis Morissette, Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, [14] and the \"pouty\", \"angsty\" sound of rock acts No Doubt and the White Stripes [15] She also cited her mother's musical tastes as an influence, as she introduced a young Rodrigo to metal, punk, and 1990s alternative rock [10]\n\nMusic and lyrics\nSour has been described as a genre-hopping pop, [19] pop-punk, [20] alternative pop, [21] [22] and bedroom pop [23] record with synth-pop, dream pop, alternative rock, pop rock, and folk-pop elements [24] [25] [26]  Stylistically, the album spans from energetic 1990s-inspired guitar rock to tender acoustic balladry driven by piano and fingerpicked guitars [27] [28] Craig Jenkins of Vulture categorized Sour as a \"post-genre\" record, one which materializes Rodrigo's aim to transcend boundaries of music genres and coalesce them [26] The songs of Sour represent different perspectives to a single storyline of failed romance The songwriting is characterized by self-aware [27] themes of insecurities, anger, revenge, envy, and jealousy, using detail-specific lyrics exuding vulnerability [29] [30] [28]\n\n\nSongs\nSour opens with \"Brutal\", which Rodrigo described as \"angsty\" and \"uptempo\" Music critics characterize the track as an enjoyable, \"angrily insecure alt-rock tirade\" and \"playful and easy pop-punk\" that \"free falls into the depths of grungy rock\", with elements of indie rock [31] [32] [33] [34] \"Brutal\" was the last song written for the album; Rodrigo and Nigro wrote the track two weeks before she had to turn in the record Rodrigo noted that the song represents her teenage years [35] The song has \"thrashy\" guitars, and was reported to be a \"desire to defy any pop expectations that have been placed upon  [Rodrigo] by fans, friends, executives, or exes\" [24] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic described the guitar riff on \"Brutal\" as \"scary in the manner of Clinton-era Nine Inch Nails\" [36] \"Traitor\", the second track, is an indie pop ballad with a folk instrumental [37] [38] Its lyrics have been described to consist of \"post-grief anger and bargaining\" [24] Furthermore, details on the lyrics also depict Rodrigo's ex moving on with another girl while she is unable to get over it as she tries to figure out what went wrong [33]\n\n\nPromotion and release\nOn April 1, 2021, Rodrigo announced on social media her debut album with the working title *O*R would be released on

various colored variants, each of which were exclusively available at Rodrigo's webstore, Urban Outfitters, Target, Walmart, or Amazon [46] Merchandise in the form of clothing was also released, although some customers alleged it as being low quality and \"nothing like what was advertised\" [47] [48]\n\n\nCover artwork\nPhotographed by Grant Spanier, [49] the standard cover artwork of Sour depicts Rodrigo standing against a purple backdrop, wearing a fuzzy pale pink tank top and checkered bottoms She sticks her tongue out, with her face covered in a variety of colorful stickers The stickers on her tongue spell the album title PopSugar observed that Rodrigo is also wearing a ring in the cover artwork, identical to a ring that Taylor Swift had gifted her earlier The backside cover also has a purple background, featuring scattered stickers as well as the tracklist on a pearly-colored balloon that Rodrigo's hand is about to pop with a safety pin In the alternative cover available for the Target-exclusive and vinyl editions of Sour, purple is again the dominant color, but stickers are not present [50] Stickers also recur through the album artwork and promotional material, which followed a theme of scrapbooking in a school notebook [51]\n\n\nSingles\nSour was supported by five singles, four of which charted in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 [52] \"Drivers License\",

Born on November 11, 1987, in New Delhi, Chadha comes from a family of modest means and has risen to prominence through his dedication to public service and politics.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRaised in New Delhi, Chadha received his school education from the Modern School, Barakhamba Road, a prestigious institution in the capital city. He then pursued higher education at the University of Delhi, where he graduated. After completing his graduation, Chadha pursued chartered accountancy from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. In his early career, he worked with accounting firms, including Deloitte and Grant Thornton, where he gained valuable experience in finance and accounting.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nChadha has been an integral part of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) since its inception. In 2012, he was encouraged by Arvind Kejriwal, the founder of AAP, to draft the Delhi Lokpal Bill, which was his first significant contribution to politics. This marked the beginning of his association with the party, and he soon established himself as the AAP's TV face, becoming the youngest national spokesperson of the party. Chadha's rise to prominence in the party was swift, and he became one of the youngest national spokespersons across parties in India.\n\n**Lok Sabha Election**\n\nIn 2019, Chadha contested from the South Delhi Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Although he won the hearts of many, he lost the election to the BJP candidate, Ramesh Bidhuri. South Delhi has been a BJP stronghold since the 1980s, represented by stalwarts like Madan Lal Khurana, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, Sushma Swaraj, and Ramesh Bidhuri, as well as Balraj Madhok of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the ideological and political predecessor of the BJP.\n\n**MLA in Delhi Vidhan Sabha**\n\nIn February 2020, Chadha contested from Rajendra Nagar in the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election and won against the BJP's candidate, RP Singh, with a significant margin of 20,058 votes.

Chadha was also appointed as a Member of the Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance in Rajya Sabha, which oversees the laws and policies drafted by three union ministries and the NITI Aayog.\n\n**Advisor to the Chief Minister of Punjab**\n\nAfter the AAP's victory in Punjab, Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann appointed Chadha as the chairman of an advisory panel. Although a plea challenging his appointment was struck down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chadha's role as an advisor to the Chief Minister remains significant.\n\n**Electoral Performance**\n\nChadha's electoral performance has been impressive, with his victory in the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election and his election to the Rajya Sabha in 2022. His win in the Delhi election was significant, as he polled an impressive 57.06% of the total votes, demonstrating his popularity among the electorate.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nChadha has been in the news recently for his engagement to actress Parineeti Chopra, which took place on May 13, 2023, at Kapurthala House in New Delhi. The couple tied the knot in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on September 24, 2023, at The Leela Palace, Udaipur, Rajasthan. Chadha has been in London to undergo a vitrectomy surgery, which has raised concerns about his health. When asked about his long absence, his party colleague, Saurabh Bhardwaj, claimed that he could have lost eyesight if not for timely operation.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nChadha has been involved in several controversies, including a recent incident where five MPs accused him of forgery and breach of privilege. They alleged that their names were mentioned on the proposal to send the Delhi NCR Amendment Bill to the Select Committee without their consent, by a motion moved by Chadha. On August 11, 2023, Chadha was suspended from the Rajya Sabha for \"Gross Violation Of Rules\".\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has been compiled from various sources.

engineering operative during World War II [4] His father decided to seek work in the rebuilding of London, and moved the family to Mornington Crescent in London's Camden borough when Gambon was six His father arranged for him to be registered as a British subject, a decision that would later allow him to receive a substantive (rather than honorary) knighthood [5] [a] Brought up as a strict Roman Catholic, Gambon attended St Aloysius Boys' School in Somers Town and served at the altar [6] He went on from there to St Aloysius' College in Highgate, whose former pupils include the actor Peter Sellers [6] [7] The family later moved to North End, Kent, where he attended Crayford Secondary School but left with no qualifications at the age of 15 [8]\n\n\nCareer\nAt age 24, Gambon wrote a

1980, the first Brecht play to become a popular success Hall called him \"unsentimental, dangerous and immensely powerful,\" and  The Sunday Times called his performance \"a decisive step in the direction of great tragedy.. great acting,\" while fellow actors paid him the rare compliment of applauding him in the dressing room on the first night [17] In 1985, he appeared in the British drama film Turtle Diary directed by John Irvin with a screenplay adapted by Harold Pinter The film starred Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley [18]\n\n\n1995–2003: Broadway debut and film roles\nThere were also appearances in Harold Pinter's Old Times at the Haymarket Theatre and Ben Jonson's Volpone and the brutal sergeant in Pinter's Mountain Language In 1995, Gambon starred in David Hare's Skylight, with Lia Williams, which opened to rave reviews at the National Theatre The play transferred first to Wyndham's Theatre and then on to Broadway at the Bernard B Jacobs Theatre for a four-month run which left him in a state of advanced exhaustion [26] \"Skylight was ten times as hard to play as anything I've ever done\" he told Michael Owen in the Evening Standard \"I had a great time in New York, but wanted to return.\" Variety wrote of his performance, \"Gambon, an Irishman revered on the London stage, gives his rough-hewn character a grace that goes beyond the physical\" [27] For this performance Gambon received his only Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play [28]\n\n\n2004–2011: Harry Potter and acclaim\nHe played Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' headmaster in the third

United States [36] He returned to the role again in the fifth film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) and the sixth film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) [37] [38] He appeared in the final two films of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010) and Part 2 (2011) Gambon told an interviewer that, when playing Dumbledore, he did not \"have to play anyone really I just stick on a beard and play me, so it's no great feat I never ease into a role – every part I play is just a variant of my own personality I'm not really a character actor at all.\" [39]\n\n\n2012–2019: Television projects and final roles\nIn 2012, he starred with Eileen Atkins in an adaptation of Beckett's radio play, All That Fall The director, Trevor Nunn, staged the

aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 80% approval rating with the consensus reading, \"It's sweet, gentle, and predictable to a fault, but Dustin Hoffman's affectionate direction and the talented cast's amiable charm make Quartet too difficult to resist.\" [58] The following year, he was cast in the role of Howard Mollison in the adaptation of the best-selling book The Casual Vacancy by J.K Rowling [59] The BBC One miniseries, produced in association with HBO, consists of three one-hour parts Production began 7 July 2014 in South West England [59]\n\n\nPersonal life and

{"title": "1948_Arab–Israeli_War", "content": "\nBackground\nOn 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and the City of Jerusalem [26]\n\n\nArmed forces\nBy September 1947, the Haganah had \"10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76 mm) mortars\" [45]\n\n\nImporting arms\nIn 1946, Ben-Gurion decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a \"massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West\", and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities [46]\n\n\nArms production\nThe Yishuv also had \"a relatively advanced arms producing capacity\", that between October 1947 and July 1948 \"produced 3 million 9 mm bullets, 150,000 Mills grenades, 16,000 submachine guns (Sten Guns) and 210 three-inch (76 mm) mortars\", [45] along with a few \"Davidka\" mortars, which had been indigenously designed and produced They were inaccurate but had a loud explosion that demoralised the enemy Much of the munitions used by the Israelis came from the Ayalon Institute, a clandestine bullet factory beneath kibbutz Ayalon, which produced about 2.5 million bullets for Sten guns The munitions produced by the Ayalon Institute were said to have been the only supply that was not in shortage during the war Locally produced explosives were also plentiful After Israel's independence, these clandestine arms manufacturing operations were moved above ground All of the Haganah's weapons-manufacturing was centralised and later became Israel Military Industries [51]\n\n\nManpower\nIn November 1947, the Haganah was an underground paramilitary force that had existed as a highly organised, national force, since the Arab riots of 1920–21, and throughout the riots of 1929, Great Uprising of 1936–39, [45] and World War II It had a mobile force, the HISH, which had 2,000 full-time fighters (men and women) and 10,000 reservists (all aged between 18 and 25) and an elite unit, the Palmach composed of 2,100 fighters and 1,000 reservists The reservists trained three or four days a month [citation needed] and went back to civilian life the rest of the time These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (Heil Mishmar, lit Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25 The Yishuv's total strength was around 35,000 with 15,000 to 18,000 fighters and a garrison force of roughly 20,000 [45] [52]\n\n\nArab forces\nAt the invasion, in addition to the irregular Palestinian militia groups, the five Arab states that joined the war were Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq sending expeditionary forces of their regular armies Additional contingents came from Saudi Arabia and Yemen On the eve of war, the available number of Arab troops likely to be committed was between 23,500 and 26,500 (10,000 Egyptians, 4,500 Jordanians, 3,000 Iraqis, 3,000–6,000 Syrians, 2,000 ALA volunteers, 1,000 Lebanese, and several hundred Saudis), in addition to the irregular Palestinians already present These Arab forces had been trained by British and French instructors; this was particularly true of Jordan's Arab Legion under command of Lt Gen Sir John Glubb (known as Glubb Pasha) [113]\n\n\nPolitical objectives\nYishuv's aims evolved during the war [64] Mobilisation for a total war was organised [65] Initially, the aim was \"simple and modest\": to survive the assaults of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states \"The Zionist leaders deeply, genuinely, feared a Middle Eastern reenactment of the Holocaust, which had just ended; the Arabs' public rhetoric reinforced these fears\" As the war progressed, the aim of expanding the Jewish state beyond the UN partition borders appeared: first to incorporate clusters of isolated Jewish settlements and later to add more territories to the state and give it defensible borders A third and further aim that emerged among the political and military leaders after four or five months was to \"reduce the size of Israel's prospective large and hostile Arab minority, seen as a potential powerful fifth column, by belligerency and expulsion\" [64]\n\n\nYishuv\nYishuv's aims evolved during the war [64] Mobilisation for a total war was organised [65] Initially, the aim was \"simple and modest\": to survive the

Israel's prospective large and hostile Arab minority, seen as a potential powerful fifth column, by belligerency and expulsion\" [64]\n\n\nArab League as a whole\nThe Arab League had unanimously rejected the UN partition plan and were officially opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state alongside an Arab one.\n\n\nKing Abdullah I of Transjordan\nKing Abdullah was the commander of the Arab Legion, the strongest Arab army involved in the war according to Eugene Rogan and Avi Shlaim in 2007 [77] (In contrast, Morris wrote in 2008 that the Egyptian army was the most powerful and threatening army [78]) The Arab Legion had about 10,000 soldiers, trained and commanded by British officers.\n\n\nOther Arab states\nKing Farouk of Egypt was anxious to prevent Abdullah from being seen as the main champion of the Arab world in Palestine, which he feared might damage his own leadership aspirations of the Arab world [80] In addition, Farouk wished to annex all of southern Palestine to Egypt [80] According to Gamal Abdel Nasser the Egyptian Ministry of Defence's first communique describe the Palestine operations as a merely punitive expedition against the Zionist \"gangs\", [87] using a term frequent in Haganah reports of Palestinian fighters [88] According to a 2019 study, \"senior British intelligence, military officers and diplomats in Cairo were deeply involved in a covert scheme to drive the King to participate in the Arab states' war coalition against Israel.\" [89] These intelligence officers acted without the approval or knowledge of the British government [89]\n\n\nArab Higher Committee of Amin al-Husayni\nFollowing rumours that King Abdullah was re-opening the bilateral negotiations with Israel that he had previously conducted in secret with the Jewish Agency, the Arab League, led by Egypt, decided to set up the All-Palestine Government in Gaza on 8 September under the nominal leadership of the Mufti [90] Abdullah regarded the attempt to revive al-Husayni's Holy War Army as a challenge to his authority and all armed bodies operating in the areas controlled by the Arab Legion were disbanded Glubb Pasha carried out the order ruthlessly and efficiently [91] [92]\n\n\nInitial line-up of forces\nThough the State of Israel faced the formidable armies of neighbouring Arab countries, due to previous battles the Palestinians themselves hardly existed as a military force by the middle of May [93] The British Intelligence and Arab League military reached similar conclusions [94]\n\n\nMilitary assessments\nThough the State of Israel faced the formidable armies of neighbouring Arab countries, due to previous battles the Palestinians themselves hardly existed as a military force by the middle of May [93] The British Intelligence and Arab League military reached similar conclusions [94]\n\n\nYishuv/Israeli forces\nSources disagree about the quantity of arms at the Yishuv's disposal at the end of the Mandate According to Efraim Karsh before the arrival shipments from Czechoslovakia as part of Operation Balak, there was roughly one weapon for every three fighters, and even the Palmach could arm only two out of every three of its active members [53] According to Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, by April 1948, the Haganah had accumulated only about 20,000 rifles and Sten guns for the 35,000 soldiers who existed on paper [101] According to Walid Khalidi, \"the arms at the disposal of these forces were plentiful\" [54] France authorised Air France to transport cargo to Tel Aviv on 13 May [102]\n\n\nArab forces\nAt the invasion, in addition to the irregular Palestinian militia groups, the five Arab states that joined the war were Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq sending expeditionary forces of their regular armies Additional contingents came from Saudi Arabia and Yemen On the eve of war, the available number of Arab troops likely to be committed was between 23,500 and 26,500 (10,000 Egyptians, 4,500 Jordanians, 3,000 Iraqis, 3,000–6,000 Syrians, 2,000 ALA volunteers, 1,000 Lebanese, and several hundred Saudis), in addition to the irregular Palestinians already present These Arab forces had been trained by British and French instructors; this was particularly true of Jordan's Arab Legion under command of Lt Gen Sir John Glubb (known as Glubb Pasha) [113]\n\n\nArab states\nJordan's Arab Legion was considered the most effective Arab force Armed, trained and commanded by British officers, this 8,000–12,000 strong force was organised in four infantry/mechanised regiments supported by some forty artillery pieces and seventy-five armoured cars [115] Until January 1948, it was reinforced by the 3,000-strong Transjordan Frontier Force [116] As many as 48 British officers served in the Arab Legion [117] Glubb Pasha, the commander of the Legion, organised his forces into four brigades as follows:\n\n\nCourse of the war\nAt the last moment, several Arab leaders, to avert catastrophe – secretly appealed to the British to hold on in Palestine for at least another year [139] [140]\n\n\nFirst phase: 15 May – 11 June 1948\nThe civil war in Mandatory Palestine became a war between separate states with the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, a few hours before the termination of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight The following morning, the regular armies of neighbouring Arab states – Egypt, Transjordan and Syria – invaded territories of the former Palestinian mandate allocated for a future Arab state according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine [141] [142] [page needed]\n\n\nSouthern front – Negev\nThe Egyptian force, the largest among the Arab armies, invaded from the south.\n\n\nBattles of Latrun\nThe heaviest fighting occurred in Jerusalem and on the Jerusalem – Tel Aviv road, between Jordan's Arab Legion and Israeli forces [155] As part of the redeployment to deal with the Egyptian advance, the Israelis abandoned the Latrun fortress overlooking the main highway to Jerusalem, which the Arab Legion immediately seized [156] The Arab Legion also occupied the Latrun Monastery From these positions, the Jordanians were able to cut off supplies to Israeli fighters and civilians in Jerusalem [157]\n\n\nBattle for Jerusalem\nThe Jordanians in Latrun cut off supplies to western Jerusalem [157] Though some supplies, mostly munitions, were airdropped into the city, the shortage of food, water, fuel and medicine was acute The Israeli forces were seriously short of food, water and ammunition [157]\n\n\nNorthern Samaria\nAn Iraqi force consisting of two infantry and one armoured brigade crossed the Jordan River from northern Jordan, attacking the Israeli settlement of Gesher with little success [19] Following this defeat, Iraqi forces moved into the strategic triangle bounded by the Arab towns Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm On 25 May, they were making their way towards Netanya, when they were stopped [163] On 29 May, an Israeli attack against the Iraqis led to three days of heavy fighting over Jenin, but Iraqi forces managed to hold their positions [163] After these battles, the Iraqi forces became stationary and their involvement in the war effectively ended [123] [163]\n\n\nNorthern front – Lake of Galilee\nOn 14 May Syria entered Palestine with the 1st Infantry Brigade supported by a battalion of armoured cars, a company of French R 35 and R 37 tanks, an artillery battalion and other units [165] The Syrian president, Shukri al-Quwwatli instructed his troops in the front, \"to destroy the Zionists\" \"The situation was very grave There aren't enough rifles There are no heavy weapons,\" Ben-Gurion told the Israeli Cabinet [166] [167] On 15 May, the Syrian forces turned to the eastern and southern Sea of Galilee shores, and attacked Samakh the neighbouring Tegart fort and the settlements of Sha'ar HaGolan, Ein Gev, but they were bogged down by resistance [19] Later, they attacked Samakh using tanks and aircraft, and on 18 May they succeeded in conquering Samakh [165] and occupied the abandoned Sha'ar HaGolan [19]\n\n\nPalestinian forces\nIn the continuity of the civil war between Jewish and Arab forces that had begun in 1947, battles between Israeli forces and Palestinian Arab militias took place, particularly in the Lydda, al-Ramla, Jerusalem, and Haifa areas On 23 May, the Alexandroni Brigade captured Tantura, south of Haifa, from Arab forces On 2 June, Holy War Army commander Hasan Salama was killed in a battle with Haganah at Ras al-Ein [citation needed]\n\n\nAir operations\nAll Jewish aviation assets were placed under the control of the Sherut Avir (Air Service, known as the SA) in November 1947 and flying operations began in the following month from a small civil airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv called Sde Dov, with the first ground support operation (in an RWD-13) [170] taking place on 17 December The Galilee Squadron was formed at Yavne'el in March 1948, and the Negev Squadron was formed at Nir-Am in April By 10 May, when the SA suffered its first combat loss, there were three flying units, an air staff, maintenance facilities and logistics support At the outbreak of the war on 15 May, the SA became the Israeli Air Force With its fleet [171] of light planes it was no match for Arab forces during the first few weeks of the war with their T-6s, Spitfires, C-47s, and Avro Ansons.\n\n\nSea battles\nAt the outset of the war, the Israeli Navy consisted of three former Aliyah Bet ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in Haifa harbour, where they were tied up at the breakwater Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background – one, the INS Eilat, was an ex-US Coast Guard icebreaker, and the other two, the INS Haganah and INS Wedgwood, had been Royal Canadian Navy corvettes [179] [180]\n\n\nEnd of the first phase\nThroughout the following days, the Arabs were only able to make limited gains due to fierce Israeli resistance, and were quickly driven off their new holdings by Israeli counterattacks [citation needed]\n\n\nFirst truce: 11 June – 8 July 1948\nThe UN declared a truce on 29 May, which came into effect on 11 June and lasted 28 days.\nThe truce was designed to last 28 days and an arms embargo was declared with the intention that neither side would make any gains from the truce Neither side respected the truce; both found ways around the restrictions placed on them [182] Both the Israelis and the Arabs used this time to improve their positions, a direct violation of the terms of the ceasefire [183]\n\n\nReinforcements\nAt the time of the truce, the British view was that \"the Jews are too weak in armament to achieve spectacular success\" [182] As the truce commenced, a British officer stationed in Haifa stated that the four-week-long truce \"would certainly be exploited by the Jews to continue military training and reorganization while the Arabs would waste  [them] feuding over the future divisions of the spoils\" [183] During the truce, the Israelis sought to bolster their forces by massive import of arms [182] The IDF was able to acquire weapons from Czechoslovakia as well as improve training of forces and reorganisation of the army during this time Yitzhak Rabin, an IDF commander at the time of the war and later Israel's fifth Prime Minister, stated \" [w]ithout the arms from Czechoslovakia.. it is very doubtful whether we would have been able to conduct the war\" [185]\n\n\nUN mediator Bernadotte\nThe ceasefire was overseen by UN mediator Folke Bernadotte and a team of UN Observers made up of army officers from Belgium, United States, Sweden and France [187] [better source needed]\nBernadotte was voted in by the General Assembly to \"assure the safety of the holy places, to safeguard the well-being of the population, and to promote 'a peaceful adjustment of the future situation of Palestine'\" [183] Folke Bernadotte reported:\n\n\nSecond phase: 8–18 July 1948 (\"Ten Day Battles\")\nOn 8 July, the day before the expiration of the truce, Egyptian forces under General Muhammad Naguib renewed the war by attacking Negba [189] The following day, Israeli air forces launched a simultaneous offensive on all three fronts, ranging from Quneitra to Arish and the Egyptian air force bombed the city of Tel Aviv [190] During the fighting, the Israelis were able to open a lifeline to a number of besieged kibbutzim [182]\n\n\nSouthern front\nIn the south, the IDF carried out several offensives, including Operation An-Far and Operation Death to the Invader The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars According to Amnon Neumann, a Palmach veteran of the Southern front, hardly any Arab villages in the south fought back, due to the miserable poverty of their means and lack of weapons, and suffered expulsion [191] What slight resistance was offered was quelled by an artillery barrage, followed by the storming of the village, whose residents were expelled and houses destroyed [192]\n\n\nOperation Dani\nIsraeli Operation Dani was the most important Israeli offensive, aimed at securing and enlarging the corridor between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv by capturing the roadside cities Lod (Lydda) and Ramle In a second planned stage of the operation the fortified positions of Latrun – overlooking the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway – and the city of Ramallah were also to be captured Hadita, near Latrun, was captured by the Israelis at a cost of nine dead [citation needed]\n\n\nLydda and al-Ramla\nThe IDF forces gathered to attack the city numbered around 8,000 It was the first operation where several brigades were involved The city was attacked from the north via Majdal al-Sadiq and al-Muzayri'a, and from the east via Khulda, al-Qubab, Jimzu and Daniyal Bombers were also used for the first time in the conflict to bombard the city The IDF captured the city on 11 July [182]\n\n\nBattle of Latrun\nOn 15–16 July, an attack on Latrun took place but did not manage to occupy the fort [182] A desperate second attempt occurred on 18 July by units from the Yiftach Brigade equipped with armoured vehicles, including two Cromwell tanks, but that attack also failed Despite the second truce, which began on 18 July, the Israeli efforts to conquer Latrun continued until 20 July [citation needed]\n\n\nJerusalem\nOperation Kedem's aim was to secure the Old City of Jerusalem, but fewer resources were allocated The operation failed [200] Originally the operation was to begin on 8 July, immediately after the first truce, by Irgun and Lehi forces However, it was delayed by David Shaltiel, possibly because he did not trust their ability after their failure to capture Deir Yassin without Haganah assistance [citation needed]\n\n\nSouthern Galilee\nThe second plan was Operation Dekel, which was aimed at capturing the Lower Galilee including Nazareth Nazareth was captured on 16 July, and by the time the second truce took effect at 19:00 18 July, the whole Lower Galilee from Haifa Bay to the Sea of Galilee was captured by Israel [citation needed]\n\n\nEastern Galilee\nOperation Brosh was launched in a failed attempt to dislodge Syrian forces from the Eastern Galilee and the Benot Yaakov Bridge During the operation, 200 Syrians and 100 Israelis were killed [citation needed]\n\n\nSecond truce: 18 July – 15 October 1948\nAt 19:00 on 18 July, the second truce of the conflict went into effect after intense diplomatic efforts by the UN.\n\n\nLittle triangle pocket\nThe Arab villagers of the area known as the \"Little Triangle\" south of Haifa repeatedly fired at Israeli traffic along the main road from Tel Aviv to Haifa and were supplied by the Iraqis from northern Samaria [204] The sniping at traffic continued during the Second Truce The poorly-planned assaults on 18 June and 8 July had failed to dislodge Arab militia from their superior positions The Israelis launched Operation Shoter on 24 July in order to gain control of the main road to Haifa and to destroy all the enemy in the area [204]\n\n\nThird phase: 15 October 1948 – 10 March 1949\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the northern and southern borders of Israel.\n\n\nNorthern front – Galilee\nOn 22 October, the third truce went into effect [205] Irregular Arab forces refused to recognise the truce, and continued to harass Israeli forces and settlements in the north On the same day that the truce came into effect, the Arab Liberation Army violated the truce by attacking Manara, capturing the strongpoint of Sheikh Abed, repulsing counterattacks by local Israeli units, and ambushed Israeli forces attempting to relieve Manara The IDF's Carmeli Brigade lost 33 dead and 40 wounded [206] Manara and Misgav Am were totally cut off, and Israel's protests at the UN failed to change the situation.\n\n\nNegev\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the borders of Israel However, invading the West Bank might have brought into the borders of the expanding State of Israel a massive Arab population it could not absorb The Negev desert was an empty space for expansion, so the main war effort shifted to Negev from early October [210] Israel decided to destroy or at least drive out the Egyptian expeditionary force since the Egyptian front lines were too vulnerable as permanent borders [211]\n\n\nAnglo-Israeli air clashes\nAs the fighting progressed and Israel mounted an incursion into the Sinai, the Royal Air Force began conducting almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside Royal Egyptian Air Force planes High-flying British aircraft frequently flew over Haifa and Ramat David Airbase, and became known to the Israelis as the \"shuftykeit.\" [216]\n\n\nUN Resolution 194\nIn December 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194 It called to establish a UN Conciliation Commission to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states However, many of the resolution's articles were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected by the Arab states, or were overshadowed by war as the 1948 conflict continued.\n\n\nWeapons\nLargely leftover World War II era weapons were used by both sides Egypt had some British equipment; the Syrian army had some French German, Czechoslovak and British equipment was used by Israel [222]\n\n\nIsraeli usage of biological warfare\nResearch by Israeli historians Benny Morris and Benjamin Kedar show that during the 1948 war, Israel conducted a biological warfare operation codenamed Cast Thy Bread According to Morris and Kedar, the Haganah initially used typhoid bacteria to contaminate water wells in newly cleared Arab villages to prevent the population including militiamen from returning Later, the biological warfare campaign expanded to include Jewish settlements that were in imminent danger of being captured by Arab troops and inhabited Arab towns not slated for capture There were also plans to expand the biological warfare campaign into other Arab states including Egypt, Lebanon and Syria, but they were not carried out [225]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn 1949, Israel signed separate armistices with Egypt on 24 February, Lebanon on 23 March, Transjordan on 3 April, and Syria on 20 July The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered Mandate as it stood after Transjordan's independence in 1946 Israel controlled territories of about one-third more than was allocated to the Jewish State under the UN partition proposal [226] After the armistices, Israel had control over 78% of the territory comprising former Mandatory Palestine [227] [228] or some 21,000 km2 (8,000 sq mi), including the entire Galilee and Jezreel Valley in the north, the whole Negev in south, West Jerusalem and the coastal plain in the center.\n\n\n1949 Armistice Agreements\nIn 1949, Israel signed separate armistices with Egypt on 24 February, Lebanon on 23 March, Transjordan on 3 April, and Syria on 20 July The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered Mandate as it stood after Transjordan's independence in 1946 Israel controlled territories of about one-third more than was allocated to the Jewish State under the UN partition proposal

Valley in the north, the whole Negev in south, West Jerusalem and the coastal plain in the center.\n\n\nCasualties\nIsrael lost 6,373 of its people, about 1% of its population at the time, in the war About 4,000 were soldiers and the rest were civilians [13]\n\n\nDemographic outcomes\nDuring the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War that followed, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, out of approximately 1,200,000 Arabs living in former British Mandate of Palestine, a displacement known to Palestinians as the Nakba In 1951, the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees displaced from Israel was 711,000 [232]\n\n\nArabs\nDuring the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War that followed, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, out of approximately 1,200,000 Arabs living in former British Mandate of Palestine, a displacement known to Palestinians as the Nakba In 1951, the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees displaced from Israel was 711,000 [232]\n\n\nJews\nIn the three years from May 1948 to the end of 1951, 700,000 Jews settled in Israel, mainly along the borders and in former Arab lands, [239] doubling the Jewish population there [240] Of these, upwards of 300,000 arrived from Asian and North African states [241] [242] Among them, the largest group, over 100,000, was from Iraq The remaining came mostly from Europe, including 136,000 from the 250,000 displaced Jews of World War II living in refugee camps and urban centers in Germany, Austria, and Italy, [243] and more than 270,000 coming from Eastern Europe, [244] mainly Romania and Poland, over 100,000 each.\n\n\nHistoriography\nSince the war, different historiographical traditions have interpreted the events of 1948 differently; in the words of the New Historian Avi Shlaim, \"each side subscribes to a different version of events.\" [247] In the Israeli narrative, the war is Israel's War of Independence [247] In the Palestinian narrative, the War of 1948 is inextricable from the Nakba, the Zionist movement is one of settler colonialism, [248] and the Israelis are seen as conquerors and the Palestinians as victims [247] The different narratives of 1948 reflect these different perceptions [247]\n\n\nIsraeli narratives\nThe Israelis, whether or not they were conquerors, were irrefutably the victors of the war, and for this reason among others, \"they were able to propagate more effectively than their opponents their version of this fateful war.\" [247] Only in 1987 was that narrative effectively challenged outside the Arab world [247]\n\n\nZionist narrative\n\nAvi Shlaim gives the conventional Zionist narrative or the \"old history\" of the 1948 war as follows:\n\nNew Historians\nThe standard Zionist narrative of the war remained unchallenged outside the Arab world until the war's fortieth anniversary, when a number of critical books came out, including Simha Flapan's The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities (1987), Benny Morris's The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem (1987), Ilan Pappé's Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1948–51 (1988), and Shlaim's Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, the Zionist Movement and the Partition of Palestine (1988) [247] These writers came to be known as New Historians or \"post-Zionists.\" [251]\n\n\nNeo-Zionist narratives\nIlan Pappé identifies a turn in predominant Israeli narratives about 1948 in September 2000 In the climate of the Second Intifada and in the Post-9/11 period, \"not only were Israel's brutal military operations against the Palestinians during the new intifada seen as justified, but so was their systematic expulsion in 1948.\" [251] Evidence of the expulsions, massacres, and war crimes of 1948 brought to light by the New Historians could no longer be ignored, but writers of what Pappé calls a \"neo-Zionist\" narrative justified these as necessary or unavoidable [251]\n\n\nPalestinian narratives\nUnlike Israeli narratives that shifted over the decades, Palestinian narratives of 1948 have been more or less constant, focusing on Palestinians' indigenous rights to Palestine, Palestinian victimhood, dispossession, displacement, exile, statelessness, and more \"unrequited grievances against colonialism and Zionism.\" [249]: 209–211  The term 'Nakba' to describe the Palestinian catastrophe in the war of 1948 was coined in Constantin Zureiq's 1948 book Ma'na an-Nakba [252] Aref al-Aref wrote a six volume work titled an-Nakba   [ar] that was published in Arabic in the 1950s [253]\n\n\nArab narratives\nIn the narratives of the wider Arab-Muslim world, 1948 is seen as an \"Arab debacle,\" representative of the region's social and political decline from its \"glorious distant past.\" [249]: 210  The official narratives of Arab states on 1948 tended to be apologetic with the goal of defending their political legitimacy, while the Arab nationalists wrote with a focus on distilling and extracting historical lessons to galvanize Arab society, politics, and ideology in preparation for the next conflict with Israel – neither approach bridled itself too much with historical accuracy [256]: 6 \n\n\nWestern

Arab-Israeli War was a conflict between the newly formed State of Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq. The war began on May 15, 1948, and lasted until March 10, 1949.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition the British Mandate of Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and the City of Jerusalem. The Jewish community in Palestine, known as the Yishuv, had long been seeking a Jewish state, while the Arab community had opposed the partition plan.\n\n**Armed Forces**\n\nBy September 1947, the Haganah, the Jewish paramilitary organization, had amassed a significant quantity of arms, including 10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars, and 92 three-inch mortars. The Haganah also had a relatively advanced arms-producing capacity, producing 3 million 9mm bullets, 150,000 Mills grenades, 16,000 submachine guns, and 210 three-inch mortars between October 1947 and July 1948.\n\n**Manpower**\n\nThe Yishuv's total strength was around 35,000, with 15,000 to 18,000 fighters and a garrison force of roughly 20,000. The Arab forces, on the other hand, had around 23,500 to 26,500 troops, including regular army units and irregular militia groups.\n\n**Arab States**\n\nJordan's Arab Legion was considered the most effective Arab force, with 8,000 to 12,000 soldiers, trained and commanded by British officers. The Legion was organized in four infantry/mechanized regiments, supported by artillery pieces and armoured cars.\n\n**Course of the War**\n\nThe war began on May 15, 1948, with the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel, a few hours before the termination of the British Mandate of Palestine. The following morning, the regular armies of neighboring Arab states invaded territories allocated for a future Arab state according to the United Nations Partition Plan.\n\n**First Phase: 15 May – 11 June 1948**\n\nThe civil war in Mandatory Palestine became a war between separate states, with the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. The Arab armies, led by Egypt, Transjordan, and Syria, invaded the territories allocated for a future Arab state, according to the United Nations Partition Plan.\n\n**Southern Front – Negev**\n\nThe Egyptian force, the largest among the Arab armies, invaded from the south, capturing the city of Beersheba on May 20, 1948.\n\n**Battles of Latrun**\n\nThe heaviest fighting occurred in Jerusalem and on the Jerusalem – Tel Aviv road, between Jordan's Arab Legion and Israeli forces. The Arab Legion occupied the Latrun fortress, overlooking the main highway to Jerusalem, which the Israelis had abandoned.\n\n**Battle for Jerusalem**\n\nThe Jordanians in Latrun cut off supplies to western Jerusalem, which led to a severe shortage of food, water, fuel, and medicine. The Israeli forces were seriously short of food, water, and ammunition.\n\n**Northern Samaria**\n\nAn Iraqi force, consisting of two infantry and one armoured brigade, crossed the Jordan River from northern Jordan, attacking the Israeli settlement of Gesher with little success.\n\n**Northern Front – Lake of Galilee**\n\nThe Syrian president, Shukri al-Quwwatli, instructed his troops to \"destroy the Zionists.\" The Syrian forces were bogged down by resistance, and the Israelis were able to hold their positions.\n\n**Palestinian Forces**\n\nThe Palestinian Arab militias, known as the Holy War Army, continued to fight against the Israeli forces, particularly in the Lydda, al-Ramla, Jerusalem, and Haifa areas.\n\n**Air Operations**\n\nThe Israeli Air Service, known as the SA, began flying operations in November 1947, with the first ground support operation taking place on December 17, 1947. The SA became the Israeli Air Force on May 15, 1948, with a fleet of light planes.\n\n**Sea Battles**\n\nThe Israeli Navy, consisting of three former Aliyah Bet ships, began conducting operations in May 1948.\n\n**First Truce: 11 June – 8 July 1948**\n\nA truce was declared on May 29, 1948, which came into effect on June 11, 1948, and lasted 28 days. However, both sides found ways around the restrictions placed on them.\n\n**Second Phase: 8–18 July 1948**\n\nThe war resumed on July 8, 1948, with the Egyptian forces attacking the Israeli settlement of Negba. The Israeli forces launched a simultaneous offensive on all three fronts, ranging from Quneitra to Arish.\n\n**Southern Front**\n\nThe IDF carried out several offensives in the south, including Operation An-Far and Operation Death to the Invader. The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion was to capture villages, which they did with little resistance.\n\n**Operation Dani**\n\nThe Israeli Operation Dani was the most important Israeli offensive, aimed at securing and enlarging the corridor between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv by capturing the roadside cities Lod and Ramle.\n\n**Lydda and al-Ramla**\n\nThe IDF forces gathered to attack the city numbered around 8,000. The city was attacked from the north via Majdal al-Sadiq and al-Muzayri'a, and from the east via Khulda, al-Qubab, Jimzu, and Daniyal. The IDF captured the city on July 11, 1948.\n\n**Battle of Latrun**\n\nOn July 15-16, an attack on Latrun took place, but did not manage to occupy the fort. A desperate second attempt occurred on July 18 by units from the Yiftach Brigade equipped with armoured vehicles, including two Cromwell tanks, but that attack also failed.\n\n**Jerusalem**\n\nOperation Kedem's aim was to secure the Old City of Jerusalem, but fewer resources were allocated. The operation failed.\n\n**Lower Galilee**\n\nThe second plan was Operation Dekel, which was aimed at capturing the Lower Galilee, including Nazareth. Nazareth was captured on July 16, and by the time the second truce took effect at 19:00 on July 18, the whole Lower Galilee from Haifa Bay to the Sea of Galilee was captured by Israel.\n\n**Second Truce: 18 July – 15 October 1948**\n\nA second truce was declared on July 18, 1948, which lasted until October 15, 1948. However, irregular Arab forces continued to harass Israeli forces and settlements in the north.\n\n**Third Phase: 15 October 1948 – 10 March 1949**\n\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the northern and southern borders of Israel.\n\n**Northern Front – Galilee**\n\nThe Arab Liberation Army violated the truce by attacking Manara, capturing the strongpoint of Sheikh Abed, repulsing counterattacks by local Israeli units, and ambushing Israeli forces attempting to relieve Manara.\n\n**Negev**\n\nThe IDF launched a series of military operations to drive out the Egyptian expeditionary force and secure the borders of Israel.\n\n**Anglo-Israeli Air Clashes**\n\nThe Royal Air Force began conducting almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai.\n\n**UN Resolution 194**\n\nThe UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194 in December 1948, which called for the establishment of a UN Conciliation Commission to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states.\n\n**Weapons**\n\nLargely leftover World War II era weapons were used by both sides, including British equipment used by Egypt, French equipment used by the Syrians, and German equipment used by the Syrians.\n\n**Israeli Usage of Biological Warfare**\n\nResearch by Israeli historians Benny Morris and Benjamin Kedar shows that during the 1948 war, Israel conducted a biological warfare operation codenamed Cast Thy Bread.

The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered Mandate as it stood after Transjordan's independence in 1946.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nIsrael lost 6,373 people, about 1% of its population at the time, in the war.

Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and the City of Jerusalem [26]\n\n\nArmed forces\nBy September 1947, the Haganah had \"10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine-guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76 mm) mortars\" [45]\n\n\nImporting arms\nIn 1946, Ben-Gurion decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a \"massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West\", and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities [46]\n\n\nArms production\nThe Yishuv also had \"a relatively advanced arms producing capacity\", that between October 1947 and July 1948 \"produced 3 million 9 mm bullets, 150,000 Mills grenades, 16,000 submachine guns (Sten Guns) and 210 three-inch (76 mm) mortars\", [45] along with a few \"Davidka\" mortars, which had been indigenously designed and produced They were inaccurate but had a loud explosion that demoralised the enemy Much of the munitions used by the Israelis came from the Ayalon Institute, a clandestine bullet factory beneath kibbutz Ayalon, which produced about 2.5 million bullets for Sten guns The munitions produced by the Ayalon Institute were said to have been the only supply that was not in shortage during the war Locally produced explosives were also plentiful After Israel's independence, these clandestine arms manufacturing operations were moved above ground All of the Haganah's weapons-manufacturing was centralised and later became Israel Military Industries [51]\n\n\nManpower\nIn November 1947, the Haganah was an underground paramilitary force that had existed as a highly organised, national force, since the Arab riots of 1920–21, and throughout the riots of 1929, Great Uprising of 1936–39, [45] and World War II It had a mobile force, the HISH, which had 2,000 full-time fighters (men and women) and 10,000 reservists (all aged between 18 and 25) and an elite unit, the Palmach composed of 2,100 fighters and 1,000 reservists The reservists trained three or four days a month [citation needed] and went back to civilian life the rest of the time These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (Heil Mishmar, lit Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25 The Yishuv's total strength was around 35,000 with 15,000 to 18,000 fighters and a garrison force of roughly 20,000 [45] [52]\n\n\nArab forces\nAt the invasion, in addition to the irregular Palestinian militia groups, the five Arab states that joined the war were Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq sending expeditionary forces of their regular armies Additional contingents came from Saudi Arabia and Yemen On the eve of war, the available number of Arab troops likely to be committed was between 23,500 and 26,500 (10,000 Egyptians, 4,500 Jordanians, 3,000 Iraqis, 3,000–6,000 Syrians, 2,000 ALA volunteers, 1,000 Lebanese, and several hundred Saudis), in addition to the irregular Palestinians already present These Arab forces had been trained by British and French instructors; this was particularly true of Jordan's Arab Legion under command of Lt Gen Sir John Glubb (known as Glubb Pasha) [113]\n\n\nPolitical objectives\nYishuv's aims evolved during the war [64] Mobilisation for a total war was organised [65] Initially, the aim was \"simple and modest\": to survive the assaults of the Palestinian Arabs and the Arab states \"The Zionist leaders deeply, genuinely, feared a Middle Eastern reenactment of the Holocaust, which had just ended; the Arabs' public rhetoric reinforced these fears\" As the war progressed, the aim of expanding the Jewish state beyond the UN partition borders appeared: first to incorporate clusters of isolated Jewish settlements and later to add more territories to the state and give it defensible borders A third and further aim that emerged among the political and military leaders after four or five months was to \"reduce the size of Israel's prospective large and hostile Arab minority, seen as a potential powerful fifth column, by belligerency and expulsion\" [64]\n\n\nYishuv\nYishuv's aims

the establishment of a Jewish state alongside an Arab one.\n\n\nKing Abdullah I of Transjordan\nKing Abdullah was the commander of the Arab Legion, the strongest Arab army involved in the war according to Eugene Rogan and Avi Shlaim in 2007 [77] (In contrast, Morris wrote in 2008 that the Egyptian army was the most powerful and threatening army [78]) The Arab Legion had about 10,000 soldiers, trained and commanded by British officers.\n\n\nOther Arab states\nKing Farouk of Egypt was anxious to prevent Abdullah from being seen as the main champion of the Arab world in Palestine, which he feared might damage his own leadership aspirations of the Arab world [80] In addition, Farouk wished to annex all of southern Palestine to Egypt [80] According to Gamal Abdel Nasser the Egyptian Ministry of Defence's first communique describe the Palestine operations as a merely punitive expedition against the Zionist \"gangs\", [87] using a term frequent in Haganah reports of Palestinian fighters [88] According to a 2019 study, \"senior British intelligence, military officers and diplomats in Cairo were deeply involved in a covert scheme to drive the King to participate in the Arab states' war coalition against Israel.\" [89] These intelligence officers acted without the approval or knowledge of the British government [89]\n\n\nArab Higher Committee of Amin al-Husayni\nFollowing rumours that King Abdullah was re-opening the bilateral negotiations with Israel that he had previously conducted in secret with the Jewish Agency, the Arab League, led by Egypt, decided to set up the All-Palestine Government in Gaza on 8 September under the nominal leadership of the Mufti [90] Abdullah regarded the attempt to revive al-Husayni's Holy War Army as a challenge to his authority and all armed bodies operating in the areas controlled by the Arab Legion were disbanded Glubb Pasha carried out the order ruthlessly and efficiently [91] [92]\n\n\nInitial line-up of forces\nThough the State of Israel faced the formidable armies of neighbouring Arab countries, due to previous battles the Palestinians themselves hardly existed as a military force by the middle of May [93] The British Intelligence and Arab League military reached similar conclusions [94]\n\n\nMilitary assessments\nThough the State of Israel faced the formidable armies of neighbouring Arab

Czechoslovakia as part of Operation Balak, there was roughly one weapon for every three fighters, and even the Palmach could arm only two out of every three of its active members [53] According to Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, by April 1948, the Haganah had accumulated only about 20,000 rifles and Sten guns for the 35,000 soldiers who existed on paper [101] According to Walid Khalidi, \"the arms at the disposal of these forces were plentiful\" [54] France authorised Air France to transport cargo to Tel Aviv on 13 May [102]\n\n\nArab forces\nAt the invasion, in addition to the

Iraqis, 3,000–6,000 Syrians, 2,000 ALA volunteers, 1,000 Lebanese, and several hundred Saudis), in addition to the irregular Palestinians already present These Arab forces had been trained by British and French instructors; this was particularly true of Jordan's Arab Legion under command of Lt Gen Sir John Glubb (known as Glubb Pasha) [113]\n\n\nArab states\nJordan's Arab Legion was considered the most effective Arab force Armed, trained and commanded by British officers, this 8,000–12,000 strong force was organised in four infantry/mechanised regiments supported by some forty artillery pieces and seventy-five armoured cars [115] Until January 1948, it was reinforced by the 3,000-strong Transjordan Frontier Force [116] As many as 48 British officers served in the Arab Legion [117] Glubb Pasha, the commander of the Legion, organised his forces into four brigades as follows:\n\n\nCourse of the war\nAt the last moment, several Arab leaders, to avert catastrophe – secretly appealed to the British to hold on in Palestine for at least another year [139] [140]\n\n\nFirst phase: 15 May – 11 June 1948\nThe civil war in Mandatory Palestine became a war between separate states with the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, a few hours before the termination of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight The following morning, the regular armies of neighbouring Arab states – Egypt, Transjordan and Syria – invaded territories of the former Palestinian mandate allocated for a future Arab state according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine [141] [142] [page needed]\n\n\nSouthern front – Negev\nThe Egyptian force, the largest among the Arab armies, invaded from the south.\n\n\nBattles of Latrun\nThe heaviest fighting occurred in Jerusalem and on the Jerusalem – Tel Aviv road, between Jordan's Arab Legion and Israeli forces [155] As part of the redeployment to deal with the Egyptian advance, the Israelis abandoned the Latrun fortress overlooking the main highway to Jerusalem, which the Arab Legion immediately seized [156] The Arab Legion also occupied the Latrun Monastery From these positions, the Jordanians were able to cut off supplies to Israeli fighters and civilians in Jerusalem [157]\n\n\nBattle for Jerusalem\nThe Jordanians in Latrun cut off supplies to western Jerusalem [157] Though some supplies, mostly munitions, were airdropped into the city, the shortage of food, water, fuel and medicine was acute The Israeli forces were seriously short of food, water and ammunition [157]\n\n\nNorthern Samaria\nAn Iraqi force consisting of two infantry and one armoured brigade crossed the Jordan River from northern Jordan, attacking the Israeli settlement of Gesher with little success [19] Following this defeat, Iraqi forces moved into the strategic triangle bounded by the Arab towns Nablus, Jenin and Tulkarm On 25 May, they were making their way towards Netanya, when they were stopped [163] On 29 May, an Israeli attack against the Iraqis led to three days of heavy fighting over Jenin, but Iraqi forces managed to hold their positions [163] After these battles, the Iraqi forces became stationary and their involvement in the war effectively ended [123] [163]\n\n\nNorthern front – Lake of Galilee\nOn 14 May Syria entered Palestine with the 1st Infantry Brigade supported by a battalion of armoured cars, a company of French R 35 and R 37 tanks, an artillery battalion and other units [165] The Syrian president, Shukri al-Quwwatli instructed his troops in the front, \"to destroy the Zionists\" \"The situation was very grave There aren't enough rifles There are no heavy weapons,\" Ben-Gurion told the Israeli Cabinet [166] [167] On 15 May, the Syrian forces turned to the eastern and southern Sea of Galilee shores, and attacked Samakh the neighbouring Tegart fort and the settlements of Sha'ar HaGolan, Ein Gev, but they were bogged down by resistance [19] Later, they attacked Samakh using tanks and aircraft, and on 18 May they succeeded in conquering Samakh [165] and occupied the abandoned Sha'ar HaGolan [19]\n\n\nPalestinian forces\nIn the continuity of the civil war between Jewish and Arab forces that had begun in 1947, battles between Israeli forces and Palestinian Arab militias took place, particularly in the Lydda, al-Ramla, Jerusalem, and Haifa areas On 23 May, the Alexandroni Brigade captured Tantura, south of Haifa, from Arab forces On 2 June, Holy War Army commander Hasan Salama was killed in a battle with Haganah at Ras al-Ein [citation needed]\n\n\nAir operations\nAll Jewish aviation assets were placed under the control of the Sherut Avir (Air Service, known as the SA) in November 1947 and flying operations began in the following month from a small civil airport on the outskirts of Tel Aviv called Sde Dov, with the first ground support operation (in an RWD-13) [170] taking place on 17 December The Galilee Squadron was formed at Yavne'el in March 1948, and the Negev Squadron was formed at Nir-Am in April By 10 May, when the SA suffered its first combat loss, there were three flying units, an air staff, maintenance facilities and logistics support At the outbreak of the war on 15 May, the SA became the Israeli Air Force With its fleet [171] of light planes it was no match for Arab forces during the first few weeks of the war with their T-6s, Spitfires, C-47s, and Avro Ansons.\n\n\nSea battles\nAt the outset of the war, the Israeli Navy consisted of three former Aliyah Bet ships that had been seized by the British and impounded in Haifa harbour, where they were tied up at the breakwater Work on establishing a navy had begun shortly before Israeli independence, and the three ships were selected due to them having a military background – one, the INS Eilat, was an ex-US Coast Guard icebreaker, and the other two, the INS Haganah and INS Wedgwood, had been Royal Canadian Navy corvettes [179] [180]\n\n\nEnd of the first phase\nThroughout the following days, the Arabs were only able to make limited gains due to fierce Israeli resistance, and were quickly driven off their new holdings by Israeli counterattacks [citation needed]\n\n\nFirst truce: 11 June – 8 July 1948\nThe UN declared a truce on 29 May, which came into effect on 11 June and lasted 28 days.\nThe truce was designed to last 28 days and an arms embargo was declared with the intention that neither side would make any gains from the truce Neither side respected the truce; both found ways around the restrictions placed on them [182] Both the Israelis and the Arabs used this time to improve their positions, a direct violation of the terms of the ceasefire [183]\n\n\nReinforcements\nAt the time of the truce, the British view was that \"the Jews are too weak in armament to achieve spectacular success\" [182] As the truce commenced, a British officer stationed in Haifa stated that the four-week-long truce \"would certainly be exploited by the Jews to continue military training and reorganization while the Arabs would waste  [them] feuding over the future divisions of the spoils\" [183] During the truce, the Israelis sought to bolster their forces by massive import of arms [182] The IDF was able to acquire weapons from Czechoslovakia as well as improve training of forces and reorganisation of the army during this time Yitzhak Rabin, an IDF commander at the time of the war and later Israel's fifth Prime Minister, stated \" [w]ithout the arms from Czechoslovakia.. it is very doubtful whether we would have been able to conduct the war\" [185]\n\n\nUN mediator Bernadotte\nThe ceasefire was overseen by UN mediator Folke Bernadotte and a team of UN Observers made up of army officers from Belgium, United States, Sweden and France [187] [better source needed]\nBernadotte was voted in by the General Assembly to \"assure the safety of the holy places, to safeguard the well-being of the population, and to promote 'a peaceful adjustment of the future situation of Palestine'\" [183] Folke Bernadotte reported:\n\n\nSecond phase: 8–18 July 1948 (\"Ten Day Battles\")\nOn 8 July, the day before the expiration of the truce, Egyptian forces under General Muhammad Naguib renewed the war by attacking Negba [189] The following day, Israeli air forces launched a simultaneous offensive on all three fronts, ranging from Quneitra to Arish and the Egyptian air force bombed the city of Tel Aviv [190] During the fighting, the Israelis were able to open a lifeline to a number of besieged kibbutzim [182]\n\n\nSouthern front\nIn the south, the IDF carried out several offensives, including Operation An-Far and Operation Death to the Invader The task of the 11th Brigades's 1st Battalion on the southern flank was to capture villages, and its operation ran smoothly, with but little resistance from local irregulars According to Amnon Neumann, a Palmach veteran of the Southern front, hardly any Arab villages in the south fought back, due to the miserable poverty of their means and lack of weapons, and suffered expulsion [191] What slight resistance was offered was quelled by an artillery barrage, followed by the storming of the village, whose residents were expelled and houses destroyed [192]\n\n\nOperation Dani\nIsraeli Operation Dani was the most important Israeli offensive, aimed at securing and enlarging the corridor between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv by capturing the roadside cities Lod (Lydda) and Ramle In a second planned stage of the operation the fortified positions of Latrun – overlooking the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway – and the city of Ramallah were also to be captured Hadita, near Latrun, was captured by the Israelis at a cost of nine dead [citation needed]\n\n\nLydda and al-Ramla\nThe IDF forces gathered to attack the city numbered around 8,000 It was the first operation where several brigades were involved The city was attacked from the north via Majdal al-Sadiq and al-Muzayri'a, and from the east via Khulda, al-Qubab, Jimzu and Daniyal Bombers were also used for the first time in the conflict to bombard the city The IDF captured the city on 11 July [182]\n\n\nBattle of Latrun\nOn 15–16 July, an attack on Latrun took place but did not manage to occupy the fort [182] A desperate second attempt occurred on 18 July by units from the Yiftach Brigade equipped with armoured vehicles, including two Cromwell tanks, but that attack also failed Despite the second truce, which began on 18 July, the Israeli efforts to conquer Latrun continued until 20 July [citation needed]\n\n\nJerusalem\nOperation Kedem's aim was to secure the Old City of Jerusalem, but fewer resources were allocated The operation failed [200] Originally the operation was to begin on 8 July, immediately after the first truce, by Irgun and Lehi forces However, it was delayed by David Shaltiel, possibly because he did not trust their ability after their failure to capture Deir Yassin without Haganah assistance [citation needed]\n\n\nSouthern Galilee\nThe second plan was Operation Dekel, which was aimed at capturing the Lower Galilee including Nazareth Nazareth was captured on 16 July, and by the time the second truce took effect at 19:00 18 July, the whole Lower Galilee from Haifa Bay to the Sea of Galilee was captured by Israel [citation needed]\n\n\nEastern Galilee\nOperation Brosh was launched in a failed attempt to dislodge Syrian forces from the Eastern Galilee and the Benot Yaakov Bridge During the operation, 200 Syrians and 100 Israelis were killed [citation needed]\n\n\nSecond truce: 18 July – 15 October 1948\nAt 19:00 on 18 July, the second truce of the conflict went into effect after intense diplomatic efforts by the UN.\n\n\nLittle triangle pocket\nThe Arab villagers of the area known as the \"Little Triangle\" south of Haifa repeatedly fired at Israeli traffic along the main road from Tel Aviv to Haifa and were supplied by the Iraqis from northern Samaria [204] The sniping at traffic continued during the Second Truce The poorly-planned assaults on 18 June and 8 July had failed to dislodge Arab militia from their superior positions The Israelis launched Operation Shoter on 24 July in order to gain control of the main road to Haifa and to destroy all the enemy in the area [204]\n\n\nThird phase: 15 October 1948 – 10 March 1949\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the northern and southern borders of Israel.\n\n\nNorthern front – Galilee\nOn 22 October, the third truce went into effect [205] Irregular Arab forces refused to recognise the truce, and continued to harass Israeli forces and settlements in the north On the same day that the truce came into effect, the Arab Liberation Army violated the truce by attacking Manara, capturing the strongpoint of Sheikh Abed, repulsing counterattacks by local Israeli units, and ambushed Israeli forces attempting to relieve Manara The IDF's Carmeli Brigade lost 33 dead and 40 wounded [206] Manara and Misgav Am were totally cut off, and Israel's protests at the UN failed to change the situation.\n\n\nNegev\nIsrael launched a series of military operations to drive out the Arab armies and secure the borders of Israel However, invading the West Bank might have brought into the borders of the expanding State of Israel a massive Arab population it could not absorb The Negev desert was an empty space for expansion, so the main war effort shifted to Negev from early October [210] Israel decided to destroy or at least drive out the Egyptian expeditionary force since the Egyptian front lines were too vulnerable as permanent borders [211]\n\n\nAnglo-Israeli air clashes\nAs the fighting progressed and Israel mounted an incursion into the Sinai, the Royal Air Force began conducting almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside Royal Egyptian Air Force planes High-flying British aircraft frequently flew over Haifa and Ramat David Airbase, and became known to the Israelis as the \"shuftykeit.\" [216]\n\n\nUN Resolution 194\nIn December 1948, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 194 It called to establish a UN Conciliation Commission to facilitate peace between Israel and Arab states However, many of the resolution's articles were not fulfilled, since these were opposed by Israel, rejected by the Arab states, or were overshadowed by war as the 1948 conflict continued.\n\n\nWeapons\nLargely leftover World War II era weapons were used by both sides Egypt had some British equipment; the Syrian army had some French German, Czechoslovak and British equipment was used by Israel [222]\n\n\nIsraeli usage of biological warfare\nResearch by Israeli historians Benny Morris and Benjamin Kedar show that during the 1948 war, Israel conducted a biological warfare operation codenamed Cast Thy Bread According to Morris and Kedar, the Haganah initially used typhoid bacteria to contaminate water wells in newly cleared Arab villages to prevent the population including militiamen from returning Later, the biological warfare campaign expanded to include Jewish settlements that were in imminent danger of being captured by Arab troops and inhabited Arab towns not slated for capture There were also plans to expand the biological warfare campaign into other Arab states including Egypt, Lebanon and Syria, but they were not carried out [225]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn 1949, Israel signed separate armistices with Egypt on 24 February, Lebanon on 23 March, Transjordan on 3 April, and Syria on 20 July The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered Mandate as it stood after Transjordan's independence in 1946 Israel controlled territories of about one-third more than was allocated to the Jewish State under the UN partition proposal [226] After the armistices, Israel had control over 78% of the territory comprising former Mandatory Palestine [227] [228] or some 21,000 km2 (8,000 sq mi), including the entire Galilee and Jezreel Valley in the north, the whole Negev in south, West Jerusalem and the coastal plain in the center.\n\n\n1949 Armistice Agreements\nIn 1949, Israel signed separate armistices with Egypt on 24 February, Lebanon on 23 March, Transjordan on 3 April, and Syria on 20 July The Armistice Demarcation Lines, as set by the agreements, saw the territory under Israeli control encompassing approximately three-quarters of the prior British administered Mandate as it stood after Transjordan's independence in 1946 Israel controlled territories of about one-third more than was allocated to the Jewish State under the UN partition proposal [226] After the armistices, Israel had control over 78% of the territory comprising former Mandatory Palestine [227] [228] or some 21,000 km2 (8,000 sq mi), including the entire Galilee and Jezreel Valley in the north, the whole Negev in south, West Jerusalem and the coastal plain in the center.\n\n\nCasualties\nIsrael lost 6,373 of its people, about 1% of its population at the time, in the war About 4,000 were soldiers and the rest were civilians [13]\n\n\nDemographic outcomes\nDuring the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War that followed, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, out of approximately 1,200,000 Arabs living in former British Mandate of Palestine, a displacement known to Palestinians as the Nakba In 1951, the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees displaced from Israel was 711,000 [232]\n\n\nArabs\nDuring the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War that followed, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, out of approximately 1,200,000 Arabs living in former British Mandate of Palestine, a displacement known to Palestinians as the Nakba In 1951, the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees displaced from Israel was 711,000 [232]\n\n\nJews\nIn the three years from May 1948 to the end of 1951, 700,000 Jews settled in Israel, mainly along the borders and in former Arab lands, [239] doubling the Jewish population there [240] Of these, upwards of 300,000 arrived from Asian and North African states [241] [242] Among them, the largest group, over 100,000, was from Iraq The remaining came mostly from Europe, including 136,000 from the 250,000 displaced Jews of World War II living in refugee camps and urban centers in Germany, Austria, and Italy, [243] and more than 270,000 coming from Eastern Europe, [244] mainly Romania and Poland, over 100,000 each.\n\n\nHistoriography\nSince the war, different historiographical traditions have interpreted the events of 1948 differently; in the words of the New Historian Avi Shlaim, \"each side subscribes to a different version of events.\" [247] In the Israeli narrative, the war is Israel's War of Independence [247] In the Palestinian narrative, the War of 1948 is inextricable from the Nakba, the Zionist movement is one of settler colonialism, [248] and the Israelis are seen as conquerors and the Palestinians as victims [247] The different narratives of 1948 reflect these different perceptions [247]\n\n\nIsraeli narratives\nThe Israelis, whether or not they were conquerors, were irrefutably the victors of the war, and for this reason among others, \"they were able to propagate more effectively than their opponents their version of this fateful war.\" [247] Only in 1987 was that narrative effectively challenged outside the Arab world [247]\n\n\nZionist narrative\n\nAvi Shlaim gives the conventional Zionist narrative or the \"old history\" of the 1948 war as follows:\n\nNew Historians\nThe standard Zionist narrative of the war remained unchallenged outside the Arab world until the war's fortieth anniversary, when a number of critical books came out, including Simha Flapan's The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities (1987), Benny Morris's The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem (1987), Ilan Pappé's Britain and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1948–51 (1988), and Shlaim's Collusion Across the Jordan: King Abdullah, the Zionist Movement and the Partition of Palestine (1988) [247] These writers came to be known as New Historians or \"post-Zionists.\" [251]\n\n\nNeo-Zionist narratives\nIlan Pappé identifies a turn in predominant Israeli narratives about 1948 in September 2000 In the climate of the Second Intifada and in the Post-9/11 period, \"not only were Israel's brutal military operations against the Palestinians during the new intifada seen as justified, but so was their systematic expulsion in 1948.\" [251] Evidence of the expulsions, massacres, and war crimes of 1948 brought to light by the New Historians could no longer be ignored, but writers of what Pappé calls a \"neo-Zionist\" narrative justified these as necessary or unavoidable [251]\n\n\nPalestinian narratives\nUnlike Israeli narratives that shifted over the decades, Palestinian narratives of 1948 have been more or less constant, focusing on Palestinians' indigenous rights to Palestine, Palestinian victimhood, dispossession, displacement, exile, statelessness, and more \"unrequited grievances against colonialism and Zionism.\" [249]: 209–211  The term 'Nakba' to describe the Palestinian catastrophe in the war of 1948 was coined in Constantin Zureiq's 1948 book Ma'na an-Nakba [252] Aref al-Aref wrote a six volume work titled an-Nakba   [ar] that was published in Arabic in the 1950s [253]\n\n\nArab narratives\nIn the narratives of the wider Arab-Muslim world, 1948 is seen as an \"Arab debacle,\" representative of the region's social and political decline from its \"glorious distant past.\" [249]: 210  The official narratives of Arab states on 1948 tended to be apologetic with the goal of defending their political legitimacy, while the Arab nationalists wrote with a focus on distilling and extracting historical lessons to galvanize Arab society, politics, and ideology in preparation for the next conflict with Israel – neither approach bridled itself too much with historical accuracy [256]: 6 \n\n\nWestern narratives\nThe American journalist Joan Peters' 1984 book From Time Immemorial had a massive impact on how 1948 was understood in popular and political narratives in the United States [257] [258]\n\n\nIn the United States\nThe American

He auditioned for Juilliard and Yale University and was accepted by both, choosing the shorter three-year degree at Yale School of Drama, where he received a scholarship.\n\n**Film and Television**\n\nNoth's breakthrough in film came with small parts in movies such as Smithereens (1982) and Baby Boom (1987). His first starring role was in the low-budget 1988 film Peluru dan Wanita (Bullets & Women) in Indonesia. Noth joined the cast of Hill Street Blues in the sixth season in 1986, where he was billed as \"Christopher Noth.\" He also appeared in Another World and had a recurring role in the television series Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNoth is co-owner of The Cutting Room, a New York lounge and music venue that opened in late 1999, with Steve Walter. He also co-owned the New York nightclub The Plumm with Noel Ashman and other investors, including David Wells and Damon Dash. Noth became majority-stake owner of Ambhar Tequila in 2018.\n\n**Sexual Misconduct Allegations**\n\nIn December 2021, Noth was accused of sexual assault by two women, who used the names Lily and Zoe. Both women claimed that Noth assaulted them in 2004 and 2015, respectively. Noth denied the allegations, stating that the incidents were consensual and that he did not cross the line of \"no means no.\" Actress and screenwriter Zoe Lister-Jones also came forward, alleging that Noth was \"consistently sexually inappropriate\" when she worked with him on a 2005 episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent. Noth was subsequently dropped by A3 Artists Agency.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nFilm\n\n* Smithereens (1982)\n* Baby Boom (1987)\n* Peluru dan Wanita (Bullets & Women) (1988)\n* Sex and the City (1998-2004)\n\nTelevision\n\n* Hill Street Blues (1986-1987)\n* Another World (1990)\n* Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2005-2006)\n* Sex and the City (1998-2004)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Noth has been nominated for several awards throughout his career, including a Tony Award nomination for his performance in the 1980 production of Innocent Thoughts, Harmless Intentions.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Chris Noth at IMDb\n* Chris Noth at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chris_Noth\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nNoth was born November 13, 1954, in Madison, Wisconsin, [1] the youngest of three boys, to news reporter Jeanne Parr (1924–2016) [4] Parr was one of the first female correspondents for CBS News, and host of her own CBS talk show The Jeanne Parr Show [5] [6] [7] His father was Charles James Noth (1922–1966), a marketing-company vice president [8] and insurance agent [9] who was a naval aviator in World War II and served as Ensign on the USS Antietam during the Korean War [4] [7] Charles came from a wealthy family in Chicago, and his mother had Irish ancestry that traces back to Knockbride in County Cavan [4] [10]\n\n\nCareer\nNoth \"did off-off Broadway and was a bad waiter in a dozen different restaurants for five years.\" [11] He was fired from a number of restaurants, once for forgetting to return Governor Hugh Carey's credit card with the bill, and settled into cater-waitering bar mitzvahs and weddings [24] [25] [28] Noth got his Actors' Equity membership while at the Circle Rep Lab [32] In Circle Repertory Company's 1980 production of Innocent Thoughts, Harmless Intentions he played soldier James \"Duke\" Wade in an Alaskan army outpost in 1951–52, part of what the CS Monitor called a \"convincing squad of Actors' Equity enlisted men\" in a play that was \"impressively acted\" [33] He auditioned for Juilliard and Yale University and was accepted by both [34] He chose the shorter three-year degree at Yale School of Drama, where he got a scholarship [24] [34]\n\n\nTheatre\nNoth \"did off-off Broadway and was a bad waiter in a dozen different restaurants for five years.\" [11] He was fired from a number of restaurants, once for forgetting to return Governor Hugh Carey's credit card with the bill, and settled into cater-waitering bar mitzvahs and weddings [24] [25] [28] Noth got his Actors' Equity membership while at the Circle Rep Lab [32] In Circle Repertory Company's 1980 production of Innocent Thoughts, Harmless Intentions he played soldier James \"Duke\" Wade in an Alaskan army outpost in 1951–52, part of what the CS Monitor called a \"convincing squad of Actors' Equity enlisted men\" in a play that was \"impressively acted\" [33] He auditioned for Juilliard and Yale University and was accepted by both [34] He chose the shorter three-year degree at Yale School of Drama, where he got a scholarship [24] [34]\n\n\nFilm and television\nNoth played small parts in films, including Smithereens (1982) and Baby Boom (1987) before his first starring role in the low-budget 1988 film Peluru dan Wanita (Bullets & Women) in Indonesia Noth joined the cast of Hill Street Blues in the sixth season in 1986, where he was billed as \"Christopher Noth.\" He also appeared in Another World.\n\n\nPersonal life\nNoth is co-owner of The Cutting Room, a New York lounge and music venue that opened in late 1999, with Steve Walter [13] [120] [3] He also co-owned the New York nightclub The Plumm with Noel Ashman and other investors including David Wells and Damon Dash [121] [122] Noth became majority-stake owner of Ambhar Tequila in 2018 [123]\n\n\nSexual misconduct allegations\nOn December 16, 2021, Noth was accused of sexual assault by two women, who used the names Lily and Zoe, with one woman alleging that Noth cheated on his wife when he assaulted her Both women, who did not know each other, contacted The Hollywood Reporter months apart [136] The incidents allegedly occurred in Los Angeles in 2004, and in New York in 2015 [137] He denied the allegations, claiming the incidents were consensual and that he did not cross the line of \"no means no\" [138] [139] The next day, actress and screenwriter Zoe Lister-Jones alleged that Noth was \"consistently sexually inappropriate\" when she worked with him on a 2005 episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, was \"a sexual predator\", and was drunk while filming his scenes [140] Subsequently, he was dropped by A3 Artists Agency [141]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Oprah_with_Meghan_and_Harry", "content": "\nBackground\nAlthough Winfrey was a guest at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018, [3] the couple first discussed their experiences with the media and public life in the 2019 ITV documentary Harry and Meghan: An African Journey with Tom Bradby [4] In March 2020, [5] Harry and Meghan stepped down as working members of the British royal family to move to North America and become financially independent, [6] subject to a 12-month review period should they change their minds In June 2020, [7] a home was purchased in Montecito, California, within the same \"super-wealthy\" enclave as Winfrey and other Hollywood celebrities [8]\n\n\nProduction and release\nWinfrey initially denied reports of a \"tell-all interview\" in January 2020 [13] Royal biographer Andrew Morton claimed that Harry had been in contact with Winfrey at least since November 2018 [14] ITV News first reported that Meghan and Harry were finalizing an interview deal in February 2021, and it was subsequently confirmed by CBS [15] The Wall Street Journal reported that CBS paid \"a license fee of between $7 million and $9 million\" for the broadcasting rights [16] The network also sought $325,000 for 30 seconds of commercial advertising time during the broadcast [17] Meghan and Harry were not paid for the interview [16] [18]\n\n\nContent\nVarious topics were discussed in the interview [24] Meghan spoke about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\" She stated they were married in their backyard in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days prior to their public wedding ceremony [25] Harry joined her later, and the pair talked about their move to the United States from the United Kingdom in 2020 and their plans for the future, [26] as well as revealing the sex of their second child, a daughter due to be born in \"the summer\" of 2021 [24] [27]\n\n\nExtra footage\nFour clips that were unaired during the main program were shown the following day on CBS This Morning [40] When asked if racism played a role in their decision to leave the UK, Harry responded: \"it was a large part of it\" [40] He also added that he did not believe that the UK is bigoted [40] Harry went on to say that after he informed the Palace about their decision to leave, the Queen canceled a pre-planned meeting with the couple in Sandringham due to a busy schedule Harry's request for another meeting was denied over the phone directly by the Queen, though he attributed her decision to the influence of her advisors [40] The couple also talked about Meghan's tabloid coverage, and (according to them) an alleged toxic environment within the royal institution Harry attributed this perceived toxicity to the \"control and the fear by the UK tabloids\", and opined that his ancestral family had adapted to such an environment [40]\n\n\nVeracity and context of claims\nAs heir apparent to his father's Dukedom of Sussex, Earldom of Dumbarton, and Barony of Kilkeel, Archie was customarily entitled to use Prince Harry's senior subsidiary title Earl of Dumbarton as a courtesy [43] At the time of Archie's birth, it was reported that it had been Meghan and Harry's decision not to have him use a courtesy title, [44] [2] [45] in accordance with their wish that he grow up as a private citizen [46] [47]\n\n\nArchie's title\nAs heir apparent to his father's Dukedom of Sussex, Earldom of Dumbarton, and Barony of Kilkeel, Archie was customarily entitled to use Prince Harry's senior subsidiary title Earl of Dumbarton as a courtesy [43] At the time of Archie's birth, it was reported that it had been Meghan and Harry's decision not to have him use a courtesy title, [44] [2] [45] in accordance with their wish that he grow up as a private citizen [46] [47]\n\n\nAlleged lack of access to personal documents\nHistorian Robert Lacey explained that Meghan handing in her driver's license would have been a requirement under security rules, as she \"would not be protected\" if she went driving by herself [59] Royal commentators said that her passport would still have been used when she was traveling internationally – only the monarch does not use one – but that it would have been kept with other royals' personal documents in a safe and accessible place, which \"really was routine, and probably anything would be accessible to her if she wanted it.\" [59] Journalist Camilla Tominey called into question Meghan's claims about lack of access to her passport, pointing out that the Duchess went on four foreign holidays in the six months after her wedding, went on official tours and enjoyed a lengthy honeymoon [60]\n\n\nState-funded security\nDuring the interview, Harry claimed that security protection and financial support had been cut off by the royal family in \"the first quarter\" of 2020, which ended in April when they were in Canada, despite there being no change in the level of threat to their safety [61] This apparently contradicted an initial agreement, based on which \"the monarchy had previously advised\" that Harry's father, Prince Charles, would continue to provide financial support for a period of one year [62] [63] During a Clarence House briefing on finances preceding the annual Sovereign Grant report, a spokesperson stated that Charles had \"allocated a substantial sum\" to support the Duke and Duchess until the summer of 2020 [64]\n\n\nCommercial deals\nIn the interview, Prince Harry stated that their commercial deals with Netflix and Spotify were \"never part of the plan\" and came into fruition on the suggestion of a third party to afford security costs after being cut off financially [37] The Daily Telegraph later reported that Meghan and Harry had held meetings surrounding \"well-developed proposals\" with the now-defunct streaming service Quibi a year before their departure from the royal family [73] The couple reportedly met with Jeffrey Katzenberg and other executives \"throughout 2019\", with alleged plans to \"discuss  [...] their own series of 10-minute videos\" [73] Andrew Morton, who wrote Diana, Princess of Wales's authorized 1992 biography and later published a book on Meghan, claimed that the Queen not only gave the couple the opportunity to choose which country they wanted to go to, but also suggested that Meghan could continue her acting career if she was not willing to carry out full time royal duties [74]\n\n\nAlleged comments about Archie's skin color\nIn the interview, Meghan relayed second hand (comments that had allegedly been said to Harry, not to her) that during her pregnancy there had been \"concerns and conversations about how dark  [Archie's] skin might be when he's born\" [76] In contrast to the suggestion of multiple conversations and comments, when asked about the same topic Harry stated it was a single instance at the beginning of their relationship: \"That conversation, I'm never going to share But at the time, it was awkward I was a bit shocked That was right at the beginning when she wasn't going to get security\" [77] Winfrey later stated that the comments were made by neither the Queen nor Prince Philip [78]\n\n\nPrivate exchange of vows\nMeghan said that they had in fact married three days before their public wedding, with a private exchange of vows on May 16 in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury [87] Harry supported this by commenting \"Yeah, just the three of us\" [88] This earlier exchange of vows was not an official religious or legally recognized marriage, both of which require at least two witnesses [89] [90] Later in March, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed that they merely exchanged \"personal vows\", and the private event was neither a \"legal\" nor \"official\" service [91] The couple's official marriage certificate also shows that they were married on May 19, with Harry's father and Meghan's mother as witnesses [91] The Archbishop of Canterbury also clarified their claim, stating \"The legal wedding was on the Saturday  [May 19] I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offence if I signed it knowing it was false\" [92] As is customary for clergy, Archbishop Welby refrained from commenting on the nature of any private meetings with the couple, but added he \"had a number of private and pastoral meetings with the duke and duchess before the wedding\" [92]\n\n\nThe Palace HR department\nIn the interview, Meghan stated that when suffering from mental health issues she tried to talk to senior palace officials, telling them she \"needed to go somewhere to get help\" but was told that she could not because \"it wouldn't be good for the institution.\" [93] She then claimed she sought help from the palace HR department, but she was refused as she was not a \"paid employee of the institution\" [93] According to journalist Jonny Dymond \"There's no HR department for working royals because it's a family affair\", and HR managers are responsible for helping lower level royal staff and the household [59] Notwithstanding, seeking private therapy has precedent in the royal family and royal biographers questioned Meghan's claim of being turned away [94] In her own 1995 interview, Harry's mother, Diana, stated that she \"received a great deal of treatment\" after suffering from postpartum depression [94] In 2017, Harry himself acknowledged that he sought counselling years after his mother's death [94]\n\n\nFlower girl dresses incident\nMonths after Meghan wed Harry, a widely reported story, damaging to her public image, was published in the British media that she had made her sister-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, cry in a dispute over flower girl dresses In the interview, Meghan insisted that the actual incident had seen the opposite occur, with Catherine causing Meghan to cry [97] [98] She added that \" [Catherine] apologized, and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing\", after which she \"forgave\" her, but sources close to the palace told The Times that Meghan had \"slammed the door in Kate's face\" when she took a bunch of flowers to Nottingham Cottage to apologize [99] Another source later told People that \"both women were in tears over the incident\" [100] Andrew Morton claimed in the revised version of his book, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, that Meghan had given Catherine and six of her friends gold bracelets following the royal wedding, a move that was described as \"an elegant peace offering\" [101]\n\n\nMontage featuring headlines\nOn March 12, lawyers for Associated Newspapers wrote a letter to ViacomCBS demanding a retraction of a montage shown in the special \"that purported to feature headlines from British newspapers\" Among examples given were an image broadcast containing the Daily Mail headline \"Meghan's seed will taint our Royal Family\", which the company stated was an edited version of the original, which reported the suspension of a UKIP politician over racist texts Representatives argued that the headlines were either doctored or taken out of context to present a \"misleading\" display [112] A third of the headlines were from gossip magazines published in Australia or the US, not the UK [113]\n\n\nClaim of being financially cut off by the royal family\nIn the interview, Harry claimed that \"members of my family were suggesting that  [Meghan] carries on acting, because there was not enough money to pay for her, and all this sort of stuff.\" Royal biographer Andrew Morton claimed the royal family's motives were benign: \"They did say to Meghan, 'If you don't want to embrace royal duties full time, please be our guest and continue your acting career.' Those opportunities were open to her.\" [117]\n\n\nClaims about lack of training on royal etiquette\nDuring the interview, Meghan claimed that \"there's no class on how to speak, how to cross your legs, how to be royal,\" and added that it might have existed for other members but not offered to her [121] In response to the claims, a former member of her staff told CNN, \"They bent over backwards as far as I could see I think there was complete hospitality and kindness and grace.\" [121] Another royal source added, \"Everyone wanted to make it a success The Queen's senior team were directed to avail themselves to ensure she had all the support needed.\" [121] It was also reported that the Queen had personally instructed her aides, including her lady-in-waiting Susan Hussey, Baroness Hussey of North Bradley, and her dresser Angela Kelly, to assist Meghan and offer her advice at Kensington Palace, which was described as \"an unprecedented gesture of support\" for a new member of the royal family [121]\n\n\nReception\nThere was a wide and polarized global reaction to the interview [122] The reaction was varied across different countries with more sympathy for the Queen and Royal Family in the UK, whereas in the US sympathy lay mostly with Harry and Meghan [123] [124] On September 9, 2021, a clip of the Oprah interview was shown at the British 26th National Television Awards, and \"the audience reportedly started booing when Harry and Meghan appeared on-screen.\" [125] [126] The special was also nominated for an American Emmy Award [127] and a 2021 Television Critics Award [128] In December 2021, Vogue named the interview among \"The 10 Best Pop-Culture Moments of 2021\" [129] It also became the most searched interview in Google Trends history [130]\n\n\nIn the media\nPrior to the broadcast of the interview, American television network NBC wrote of \"daily episodes of royal drama in the shape of leaks, counterstatements and well-timed preview clips\", which \"may have been designed to build tension ahead of the interview\" [131] However, a CNN analysis following the broadcast noted that, despite the preview clips generating attention in the week ahead of the broadcast, \" [Winfrey]'s team ensured that nothing leaked\" in regards to the biggest claims in the interview, resulting in \"maximum shock value\" [132] On the day of the U.S broadcast, comment was made in British newspaper The Observer that \"in the United States, anglophiles and amateur royal watchers are simply sitting back and lapping up the show.\" [133]\n\n\nPiers Morgan remarks\nOn the March 8, 2021 edition of  UK network ITV's morning show Good Morning Britain after the interview's U.S airing, anchor Piers Morgan disputed the veracity of Meghan's contemplation of suicide, stating \"I don't believe a word she says  [...] I wouldn't believe her if she read me a weather report.\" [147] Morgan's remarks were met with immediate backlash from viewers and other critics; [164] broadcasting and telecom regulator Ofcom received over 41,000 complaints over the program [147] British mental health charity Mind (which is a partner of a charity campaign with ITV's Britain's Got Talent) expressed \"disappointment\" in the remarks, stating that mental health issues should be \"treated with dignity, respect and empathy.\" [164]\n\n\nPolitical reaction\nUK prime minister Boris Johnson declined to comment when asked if he believed the royal family was racist, saying \"when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing\" [173] [174] The UK Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Zac Goldsmith criticized Harry on Twitter and said, \"Harry is blowing up his family 'What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.'\" [175] UK opposition leader Keir Starmer said that Meghan's allegations about racism and a lack of mental health support should be taken \"very, very seriously\" [173] Shadow education secretary Kate Green said the allegations were \"really distressing\" and \"shocking\" Labour MP and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said she could cite \"story after story when Meghan was treated quite differently from white members of the Royal Family\" [29] She also believed that with opening up about her mental health issues, Meghan could encourage black and mixed-race women to talk about their issues and vulnerabilities [176] After enquiries about a debate in the House of Commons in response to the couple's interview, Holly Lynch, who was the organizer of an open letter of support by 72 female MPs to the Duchess in 2019, said she and the other MPs who penned the letter were considering what necessary steps should be taken to prevent the \"hounding\" of high-profile women such as Meghan by the press [177]\n\n\nThe Royal Family's response\nAccording to BBC News, the interview led to \"crisis meetings involving senior royals\" [29] On March 9, Buckingham Palace released a statement in response, saying: \"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\" [193] When asked about the interview by the reporters during a visit to an East London school on March 11, Prince William responded to the allegations of racism by saying, \"We're very much not a racist family\" [194] Reporting on the couple's relationship with the royal family, CBS This Morning presenter Gayle King stated that Harry had started conversations with his father and brother but \"those conversations were not productive\" [195] In response to the allegations of racism, a source close to the palace stated that in order to tackle the issue they had \"the policies, the procedures and programmes in place but we haven't seen the progress we would like in terms of representation and more needs to be done, we can always improve\" [196] They added that it was \"too early\" to announce any \"firm plans\", but the royal family was supportive of the idea to have someone in charge of diversity and inclusion in the royal households [196]\n\n\nMarkle family's response\nOn March 9, Meghan's father Thomas Markle appeared on Good Morning Britain and apologized to his daughter for cooperating with the media outlets and making her feel betrayed He added that he still remained estranged from Meghan [197] [198] On March 25, Thomas Markle \"hand delivered a letter to Oprah Winfrey – asking her to interview him about his relationship with estranged daughter Meghan\" [199]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nA poll conducted by YouGov on March 8, after the American and Canadian broadcasts but ahead of the broadcast in the United Kingdom, found that a majority of adults in Great Britain had little sympathy for the royal couple While 56% responded that they had \"none at all\" or \"not very much\" sympathy, 17% had \"a fair amount\" of sympathy, 12% had \"a lot\" of sympathy and 15% stated that they did not know [210] Another poll by YouGov in the same timeframe found that 21% of British adults thought that the interview was \"appropriate\" and 47% thought it was \"inappropriate\"; by contrast, 44% of American adults described it as \"appropriate\" and 20% described it as \"inappropriate.\" [211]\n\n\nViewership\nAccording to CBS, the special had been seen by over 49.1 million viewers worldwide through March 8 [221]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Oprah with Meghan and Harry\n\nOprah with Meghan and Harry is a 2021 interview special that aired on CBS, featuring Oprah Winfrey in conversation with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. The interview was conducted on March 7, 2021, and was broadcast on March 7, 2021, in the United States and on March 8, 2021, in the United Kingdom.\n\nBackground\n\nAlthough Winfrey was a guest at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018, the couple first discussed their experiences with the media and public life in the 2019 ITV documentary Harry and Meghan: An African Journey with Tom Bradby. In March 2020, Harry and Meghan stepped down as working members of the British royal family to move to North America and become financially independent, subject to a 12-month review period should they change their minds. In June 2020, a home was purchased in Montecito, California, within the same \"super-wealthy\" enclave as Winfrey and other Hollywood celebrities.\n\nProduction and Release\n\nWinfrey initially denied reports of a \"tell-all interview\" in January 2020. Royal biographer Andrew Morton claimed that Harry had been in contact with Winfrey at least since November 2018. ITV News first reported that Meghan and Harry were finalizing an interview deal in February 2021, and it was subsequently confirmed by CBS. The Wall Street Journal reported that CBS paid \"a license fee of between $7 million and $9 million\" for the broadcasting rights. The network also sought $325,000 for 30 seconds of commercial advertising time during the broadcast. Meghan and Harry were not paid for the interview.\n\nContent\n\nVarious topics were discussed in the interview. Meghan spoke about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure.\" She stated they were married in their backyard in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury three days prior to their public wedding ceremony. Harry joined her later, and the pair talked about their move to the United States from the United Kingdom in 2020 and their plans for the future, as well as revealing the sex of their second child, a daughter due to be born in \"the summer\" of 2021.\n\nExtra Footage\n\nFour clips that were unaired during the main program were shown the following day on CBS This Morning. When asked if racism played a role in their decision to leave the UK, Harry responded: \"it was a large part of it.\" He also added that he did not believe that the UK is bigoted. Harry went on to say that after he informed the Palace about their decision to leave, the Queen canceled a pre-planned meeting with the couple in Sandringham due to a busy schedule Harry's request for another meeting was denied over the phone directly by the Queen, though he attributed her decision to the influence of her advisors. The couple also talked about Meghan's tabloid coverage, and (according to them) an alleged toxic environment within the royal institution. Harry attributed this perceived toxicity to the \"control and the fear by the UK tabloids\", and opined that his ancestral family had adapted to such an environment.\n\nVeracity and Context of Claims\n\nAs heir apparent to his father's Dukedom of Sussex, Earldom of Dumbarton, and Barony of Kilkeel, Archie was customarily entitled to use Prince Harry's senior subsidiary title Earl of Dumbarton as a courtesy. At the time of Archie's birth, it was reported that it had been Meghan and Harry's decision not to have him use a courtesy title, in accordance with their wish that he grow up as a private citizen.\n\nAlleged Lack of Access to Personal Documents\n\nHistorian Robert Lacey explained that Meghan handing in her driver's license would have been a requirement under security rules, as she \"would not be protected\" if she went driving by herself. Royal commentators said that her passport would still have been used when she was traveling internationally – only the monarch does not use one – but that it would have been kept with other royals' personal documents in a safe and accessible place, which \"really was routine, and probably anything would be accessible to her if she wanted it.\"\n\nState-Funded Security\n\nDuring the interview, Harry claimed that security protection and financial support had been cut off by the royal family in \"the first quarter\" of 2020, which ended in April when they were in Canada, despite there being no change in the level of threat to their safety. This apparently contradicted an initial agreement, based on which \"the monarchy had previously advised\" that Harry's father, Prince Charles, would continue to provide financial support for a period of one year. During a Clarence House briefing on finances preceding the annual Sovereign Grant report, a spokesperson stated that Charles had \"allocated a substantial sum\" to support the Duke and Duchess until the summer of 2020.\n\nCommercial Deals\n\nIn the interview, Prince Harry stated that their commercial deals with Netflix and Spotify were \"never part of the plan\" and came into fruition on the suggestion of a third party to afford security costs after being cut off financially. The Daily Telegraph later reported that Meghan and Harry had held meetings surrounding \"well-developed proposals\" with the now-defunct streaming service Quibi a year before their departure from the royal family. The couple reportedly met with Jeffrey Katzenberg and other executives \"throughout 2019\", with alleged plans to \"discuss  [...] their own series of 10-minute videos.\"\n\nAlleged Comments about Archie's Skin Color\n\nIn the interview, Meghan relayed second-hand (comments that had allegedly been said to Harry, not to her) that during her pregnancy there had been \"concerns and conversations about how dark  [Archie's] skin might be when he's born.\" In contrast to the suggestion of multiple conversations and comments, when asked about the same topic Harry stated it was a single instance at the beginning of their relationship: \"That conversation, I'm never going to share But at the time, it was awkward I was a bit shocked That was right at the beginning when she wasn't going to get security.\" Winfrey later stated that the comments were made by neither the Queen nor Prince Philip.\n\nPrivate Exchange of Vows\n\nMeghan said that they had in fact married three days before their public wedding, with a private exchange of vows on May 16 in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Harry supported this by commenting \"Yeah, just the three of us.\" This earlier exchange of vows was not an official religious or legally recognized marriage, both of which require at least two witnesses. Later in March, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed that they merely exchanged \"personal vows,\" and the private event was neither a \"legal\" nor \"official\" service. The couple's official marriage certificate also shows that they were married on May 19, with Harry's father and Meghan's mother as witnesses. The Archbishop of Canterbury also clarified their claim, stating \"The legal wedding was on the Saturday  [May 19] I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offence if I signed it knowing it was false.\" As is customary for clergy, Archbishop Welby refrained from commenting on the nature of any private meetings with the couple, but added he \"had a number of private and pastoral meetings with the duke and duchess before the wedding.\"\n\nThe Palace HR Department\n\nIn the interview, Meghan stated that when suffering from mental health issues she tried to talk to senior palace officials, telling them she \"needed to go somewhere to get help\" but was told that she could not because \"it wouldn't be good for the institution.\" She then claimed she sought help from the palace HR department, but she was refused as she was not a \"paid employee of the institution.\" According to journalist Jonny Dymond \"There's no HR department for working royals because it's a family affair,\" and HR managers are responsible for helping lower level royal staff and the household. Notwithstanding, seeking private therapy has precedent in the royal family and royal biographers questioned Meghan's claim of being turned away. In her own 1995 interview, Harry's mother, Diana, stated that she \"received a great deal of treatment\" after suffering from postpartum depression. In 2017, Harry himself acknowledged that he sought counselling years after his mother's death.\n\nFlower Girl Dresses Incident\n\nMonths after Meghan wed Harry, a widely reported story, damaging to her public image, was published in the British media that she had made her sister-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, cry in a dispute over flower girl dresses. In the interview, Meghan insisted that the actual incident had seen the opposite occur, with Catherine causing Meghan to cry. She added that \" [Catherine] apologized, and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing\", after which she \"forgave\" her, but sources close to the palace told The Times that Meghan had \"slammed the door in Kate's face\" when she took a bunch of flowers to Nottingham Cottage to apologize. Another source later told People that \"both women were in tears over the incident.\"\n\nMontage Featuring Headlines\n\nOn March 12, lawyers for Associated Newspapers wrote a letter to ViacomCBS demanding a retraction of a montage shown in the special \"that purported to feature headlines from British newspapers\" Among examples given were an image broadcast containing the Daily Mail headline \"Meghan's seed will taint our Royal Family\", which the company stated was an edited version of the original, which reported the suspension of a UKIP politician over racist texts Representatives argued that the headlines were either doctored or taken out of context to present a \"misleading\" display.

The reaction was varied across different countries with more sympathy for the Queen and Royal Family in the UK, whereas in the US sympathy lay mostly with Harry and Meghan. On September 9, 2021, a clip of the Oprah interview was shown at the British 26th National Television Awards, and \"the audience reportedly started booing when Harry and Meghan appeared on-screen.\" The special was also nominated for an American Emmy Award and a 2021 Television Critics Award. In December 2021, Vogue named the interview among \"The 10 Best Pop-Culture Moments of 2021.\" It also became the most searched interview in Google Trends history.\n\nIn the Media\n\nPrior to the broadcast of the interview, American television network NBC wrote of \"daily episodes of royal drama in the shape of leaks, counterstatements and well-timed preview clips,\" which \"may have been designed to build tension ahead of the interview.\" However, a CNN analysis following the broadcast noted that, despite the preview clips generating attention in the week ahead of the broadcast, \"[Winfrey]'s team ensured that nothing leaked\" in regards to the biggest claims in the interview, resulting in \"maximum shock value.\" On the day of the U.S broadcast, comment was made in British newspaper The Observer that \"in the United States, anglophiles and amateur royal watchers are simply sitting back and lapping up the show.\"\n\nPiers Morgan Remarks\n\nOn the March 8, 2021 edition of UK network ITV's morning show Good Morning Britain after the interview's U.S airing, anchor Piers Morgan disputed the veracity of Meghan's contemplation of suicide, stating \"I don't believe a word she says...

Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nWhen asked about the interview by the reporters during a visit to an East London school on March 11, Prince William responded to the allegations of racism by saying, \"We're very much not a racist family.\" Reporting on the couple's relationship with the royal family, CBS This Morning presenter Gayle King stated that Harry had started conversations with his father and brother but \"those conversations were not productive.\" In response to the allegations of racism, a source close to the palace stated that in order to tackle the issue they had \"the policies, the procedures and programmes in place but we haven't seen the progress we would like in terms of representation and more needs to be done, we can always improve.\" They added that it was \"too early\" to announce any \"firm plans,\" but the royal family was supportive of the idea to have someone in charge of diversity and inclusion in the royal households.\n\nMarkle Family's Response\n\nOn March 9, Meghan's father Thomas Markle appeared on Good Morning Britain and apologized to his daughter for cooperating with the media outlets and making her feel betrayed. He added that he still remained estranged from Meghan. On March 25, Thomas Markle \"hand delivered a letter to Oprah Winfrey – asking her to interview him about his relationship with estranged daughter Meghan.\"\n\nPublic Opinion\n\nA poll conducted by YouGov on March 8, after the American and Canadian broadcasts but ahead of the broadcast in the United Kingdom, found that a majority of adults in Great Britain had little sympathy for the royal couple.

[May 19] I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offence if I signed it knowing it was false\" [92] As is customary for clergy, Archbishop Welby refrained from commenting on the nature of any private meetings with the couple, but added he \"had a number of private and pastoral meetings with the duke and duchess before the wedding\" [92]\n\n\nThe Palace HR department\nIn the interview, Meghan stated that when suffering from mental health issues she tried to talk to senior palace officials, telling them she \"needed to go somewhere to get help\" but was told that she could not because \"it wouldn't be good for the institution.\" [93] She then claimed she sought help from the palace HR department, but she was refused as she was not a \"paid employee of the institution\" [93] According to journalist Jonny Dymond \"There's no HR department for working royals because it's a family affair\", and HR managers are responsible for helping lower level royal staff and the household [59] Notwithstanding, seeking private therapy has precedent in the royal family and royal biographers questioned Meghan's claim of being turned away [94] In her own 1995 interview, Harry's mother, Diana, stated that she \"received a great deal of treatment\" after suffering from postpartum depression [94] In 2017, Harry himself acknowledged that he sought counselling years after his mother's death [94]\n\n\nFlower girl dresses incident\nMonths after Meghan wed Harry, a widely reported story, damaging to her public image, was published in the British media that she had made her sister-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, cry in a dispute over flower girl dresses In the interview, Meghan insisted that the actual incident had seen the opposite occur, with Catherine causing Meghan to cry [97] [98] She added that \" [Catherine] apologized, and she brought me flowers and a note apologizing\", after which she \"forgave\" her, but sources close to the palace told The Times that Meghan had \"slammed the door in Kate's face\" when she took a bunch of flowers to Nottingham Cottage to apologize [99] Another source later told People that \"both women were in tears over the incident\" [100] Andrew Morton claimed in the revised version of his book, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, that Meghan had given Catherine and six of her friends gold bracelets following the royal wedding, a move that was described as \"an elegant peace offering\" [101]\n\n\nMontage featuring headlines\nOn March 12, lawyers for Associated Newspapers wrote a letter to ViacomCBS demanding a retraction of a montage shown in the special \"that purported to feature headlines from British newspapers\" Among examples given were an image broadcast containing the Daily Mail headline \"Meghan's seed will taint our Royal Family\", which the company stated was an edited version of the original, which reported the suspension of a UKIP politician over racist texts Representatives argued that the headlines were either doctored or taken out of context to present a \"misleading\" display [112] A third of the headlines were from gossip magazines published in Australia or the US, not the UK [113]\n\n\nClaim of being financially cut off by the royal family\nIn the interview, Harry claimed that \"members of my family were suggesting that  [Meghan] carries on acting, because there was not enough money to pay for her, and all this sort of stuff.\" Royal biographer Andrew Morton claimed the royal family's motives were benign: \"They did say to Meghan, 'If you don't want to embrace royal duties full time, please be our guest and continue your acting career.' Those opportunities were open to her.\" [117]\n\n\nClaims about lack of training on royal etiquette\nDuring the interview, Meghan claimed that \"there's no class on how to speak, how to cross your legs, how to be royal,\" and added that it might have existed for other members but not offered to her [121] In response to the claims, a former member of her staff told CNN, \"They bent over backwards as far as I could see I think there was complete hospitality and kindness and grace.\" [121] Another royal source added, \"Everyone wanted to make it a success The Queen's senior team were directed to avail themselves to ensure she had all the support needed.\" [121] It was also reported that the Queen had personally instructed her aides, including her lady-in-waiting Susan Hussey, Baroness Hussey of North Bradley, and her dresser Angela Kelly, to assist Meghan and offer her advice at Kensington Palace, which was described as \"an unprecedented gesture of support\" for a new member of the royal family [121]\n\n\nReception\nThere was a wide and polarized global reaction to the interview [122] The reaction was varied across different countries with more sympathy for the Queen and Royal Family in the UK, whereas in the US sympathy lay mostly with Harry and Meghan [123] [124] On September 9, 2021, a clip of the Oprah interview was shown at the British 26th National Television Awards, and \"the audience reportedly started booing when Harry and Meghan appeared on-screen.\" [125] [126] The special was also nominated for an American Emmy Award [127] and a 2021 Television Critics Award [128] In December 2021, Vogue named the interview among \"The 10 Best Pop-Culture Moments of 2021\" [129] It also became the most searched interview in Google Trends history [130]\n\n\nIn the media\nPrior to the broadcast of the interview, American television network NBC wrote of \"daily episodes of royal drama in the shape of leaks, counterstatements and well-timed preview clips\", which \"may have been designed to build tension ahead of the interview\" [131] However, a CNN analysis following the broadcast noted that, despite the preview clips generating attention in the week ahead of the broadcast, \" [Winfrey]'s team ensured that nothing leaked\" in regards to the biggest claims in the interview, resulting in \"maximum shock value\" [132] On the day of the U.S broadcast, comment was made in British newspaper The Observer that \"in the United States, anglophiles and amateur royal watchers are simply sitting back and lapping up the show.\" [133]\n\n\nPiers Morgan remarks\nOn the March 8, 2021 edition of  UK network ITV's morning show Good Morning Britain after the interview's U.S airing, anchor Piers Morgan disputed the veracity of Meghan's contemplation of suicide, stating \"I don't believe a word she says  [...] I wouldn't believe her if she read me a weather report.\" [147] Morgan's remarks were met with immediate backlash from viewers and other critics; [164] broadcasting and telecom regulator Ofcom received over 41,000 complaints over the program [147] British mental health charity Mind (which is a partner of a charity campaign with ITV's Britain's Got Talent) expressed \"disappointment\" in the remarks, stating that mental health issues should be \"treated with dignity, respect and empathy.\" [164]\n\n\nPolitical reaction\nUK prime minister Boris Johnson declined to comment when asked if he believed the royal family was racist, saying \"when it comes to matters to do with the Royal Family, the right thing for prime ministers to say is nothing\" [173] [174] The UK Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Zac Goldsmith criticized Harry on Twitter and said, \"Harry is blowing up his family 'What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.'\" [175] UK opposition leader Keir Starmer said that Meghan's allegations about racism and a lack of mental health support should be taken \"very, very seriously\" [173] Shadow education secretary Kate Green said the allegations were \"really distressing\" and \"shocking\" Labour MP and former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said she could cite \"story after story when Meghan was treated quite differently from white members of the Royal Family\" [29] She also believed that with opening up about her mental health issues, Meghan could encourage black and mixed-race women to talk about their issues and vulnerabilities [176] After enquiries about a debate in the House of Commons in response to the couple's interview, Holly Lynch, who was the organizer of an open letter of support by 72 female MPs to the Duchess in 2019, said she and the other MPs who penned the letter were considering what necessary steps should be taken to prevent the \"hounding\" of high-profile women such as Meghan by the press [177]\n\n\nThe Royal Family's response\nAccording to BBC News, the interview led to \"crisis meetings involving senior royals\" [29] On March 9, Buckingham Palace released a statement in response, saying: \"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.\" [193] When asked about the interview by the reporters during a visit to an East London school on March 11, Prince William responded to the allegations of racism by saying, \"We're very much not a racist family\" [194] Reporting on the couple's relationship with the royal family, CBS This Morning presenter Gayle King stated that Harry had started conversations with his father and brother but \"those conversations were not productive\" [195] In response to the allegations of racism, a source close to the palace stated that in order to tackle the issue they had \"the policies, the procedures and programmes in place but we haven't seen the progress we would like in terms of representation and more needs to be done, we can always improve\" [196] They added that it was \"too early\" to announce any \"firm plans\", but the royal family was supportive of the idea to have someone in charge of diversity and inclusion in the royal households [196]\n\n\nMarkle family's response\nOn March 9, Meghan's father Thomas Markle appeared on Good Morning Britain and apologized to his daughter for cooperating with the media outlets and making her feel betrayed He added that he still remained estranged from Meghan [197] [198] On March 25, Thomas Markle \"hand delivered a letter to Oprah Winfrey – asking her to interview him about his relationship with estranged daughter Meghan\" [199]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nA poll conducted by YouGov on March 8, after the American and Canadian broadcasts but ahead of the broadcast in the United Kingdom, found that a majority of adults in Great Britain had little sympathy for the royal couple While 56% responded that they had \"none at all\" or \"not very much\" sympathy, 17% had \"a fair amount\" of sympathy, 12% had \"a lot\" of sympathy and 15% stated that they did not know [210] Another poll by YouGov in the same timeframe found that 21% of British adults thought that the interview was \"appropriate\" and 47% thought it was \"inappropriate\"; by contrast, 44% of American adults described it as \"appropriate\" and 20% described it as \"inappropriate.\" [211]\n\n\nViewership\nAccording to CBS, the special had been seen by over 49.1 million viewers worldwide through March 8 [221]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He rose to fame as a child actor, known for his role as Billy Elliot in the 2000 film of the same name, which earned him widespread critical acclaim. Throughout his career, Bell has appeared in a variety of films, television shows, and stage productions, solidifying his position as a talented and versatile actor.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAndrew James Matfin Bell was born to Eileen Matfin and John Bell, a toolmaker. His father left before Jamie was born, and he was raised by his mother and his elder sister, Kathryn. Growing up, Bell was encouraged to participate in dance by his sister, who took ballet lessons. This early exposure to dance sparked his interest and laid the foundation for his future career.\n\n**Career**\n\nBell's involvement in the entertainment industry began when he auditioned for the role of Billy Elliot, a young boy who defies his working-class upbringing to pursue a career in ballet. In 1999, Bell was chosen from over 2,000 boys to play the lead role in the film adaptation of the stage musical. His performance received widespread critical acclaim, and Bell won several awards, including the London Film Critics' Circle Award for British Newcomer of the Year, the British Independent Film Award for Best Newcomer, the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer, and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.\n\nBell's success as Billy Elliot led to a range of opportunities in the entertainment industry. He appeared in Close and True, a television drama series that aired on ITV in 2000, and began to establish himself as a talented young actor. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Bell continued to appear in a variety of films and television shows, including The Eagle, Jane Eyre, Filth, and Snowpiercer.\n\n**2010s**\n\nIn the early 2010s, Bell began to take on more mature roles, appearing in films such as The Eagle and Jane Eyre. In 2013, he starred alongside James McAvoy in the film Filth, which received critical acclaim for its dark and gritty portrayal of life in a Scottish police force. Bell also appeared as Edgar in Snowpiercer, a science fiction film set on a train traveling through a post-apocalyptic world.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2005, Bell began dating American actress Evan Rachel Wood, whom he met at the Sundance Film Festival. The couple's relationship was marked by controversy, with false claims that they had first met while co-starring in the music video for Green Day's song \"Wake Me Up When September Ends.\" Wood has stated that they were \"already dating and very much in love by that point.\" Five years later, in mid-2011, it was reported that Bell and Wood had rekindled their relationship. The couple married in a small ceremony in California on 30 October 2012. They have one son, born in July 2013. However, the couple announced that they had separated on 28 May 2014.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ Billy Elliot (2000)\n\t+ Close and True (2000)\n\t+ The Eagle (2011)\n\t+ Jane Eyre (2011)\n\t+ Filth (2013)\n\t+ Snowpiercer (2013)\n\t+ Fantastic Four (2015)\n\t+ Flags of Our Fathers (2020)\n* **Television**\n\t+ Close and True (2000)\n\t+ Saturday Night Live (2006)\n\t+ The Simpsons (2012)\n\t+ The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (2012)\n* **Video games**\n\t+ Until Dawn (2015)\n* **Music videos**\n\t+ \"Wake Me Up When September Ends\" by Green Day (2004)\n\n**Accolades**\n\n* London Film Critics' Circle Award for British Newcomer of the Year (2000)\n* British Independent Film Award for Best Newcomer (2000)\n* Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer (2000)\n* BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (2000)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Billy Elliot (film)\n* Evan Rachel Wood\n* Green Day\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Jamie Bell\".

Some rules were maintained from previous procedures, such as the obligation for the Greek delegation to be the first to enter during the Parade of Nations and the maintenance of the entry of other delegations in the alphabetical order of the organizing country, which were the same as the last team. However, others were changed, such as the entry of IOC Refugee Olympic Team, composed of refugees from several countries, immediately behind the Greek team.\n\nAnother change was the positioning of the teams whose countries will be the future hosts of the next Summer Olympic Games, which entered the reverse sequence. According to the original planning, the United States would be the 5th delegation to enter, placed between Afghanistan and United Arab Emirates delegations. However, as the 2028 Summer Olympics are scheduled to be held in Los Angeles, they were placed as the 204th delegation. This situation also happened with France, which according to the protocol manual would be the 151st delegation, positioned between Brazil and Bulgaria. Due to the fact that Paris will be the host city of the 2024 Summer Olympics, they entered as the 205th delegation, before the host nation Japan.\n\n**Teams and Flagbearers**\n\nOn March 4, 2020, the IOC announced that each team can have the option to allow two flag bearers, one male and one female, in an effort to promote gender equality. This decision was made to increase the representation of women in the Parade of Nations and to promote the values of equality and inclusion.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMultiple Taiwanese media outlets, as well as Japanese lawmaker Akihisa Nagashima, reported that the Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) delegation had been specially ordered within the parade so that they would march under タ (ta) for either \"Taiwan\" or ambiguously \"Chinese Taipei\" rather than チ (chi) or チャイ (chai) for \"Chinese Taipei.\" However, it would have done this regardless of special ordering, as Chinese Taipei has paraded under \"T\" or its equivalent in every Parade of Nations language other than Chinese, including PyeongChang 2018 and Seoul 1988.\n\n**Taiwan (Chinese Taipei)'s Parade Entrance**\n\nThe Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) delegation's parade entrance was a topic of interest during the 2020 Summer Olympics. Multiple Taiwanese media outlets, as well as Japanese lawmaker Akihisa Nagashima, reported that the delegation had been specially ordered within the parade so that they would march under タ (ta) for either \"Taiwan\" or ambiguously \"Chinese Taipei\" rather than チ (chi) or チャイ (chai) for \"Chinese Taipei.\" This decision was seen as a way to promote the country's national identity and to increase visibility for the delegation.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe musical pieces for the Parade of Nations were selected from several video game soundtracks created in Japan. These selections included themes from Square Enix's Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, SaGa, Nier, and Chrono Trigger, Disney's Kingdom Hearts, Bandai Namco's Tales series, Soulcalibur, and Ace Combat, Capcom's Monster Hunter, Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer and Gradius, and Sega Sammy's Sonic the Hedgehog and Phantasy Star. The music was chosen to reflect the diversity and creativity of Japanese video game culture, and to provide a unique and engaging soundtrack for the Parade of Nations.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* 2020 Summer Olympics\n* International Olympic Committee\n* Parade of Nations\n* Japan\n* Tokyo\n* Olympic Stadium\n\n**References**\n\n* International Olympic Committee.

The film is a remake of the 2004 French film Cash Truck, and it follows a series of events that unfold in Los Angeles after an armored truck robbery.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn Los Angeles, an armored truck robbery leaves two guards and a bystander dead, which sets off a series of events told in four acts. The film follows a lone wolf, H, who is a new guard working for Fortico, a high-security armored car company. H is a mysterious and stoic individual who is haunted by his past, and he is assigned to work with a team of guards, including Dana Curtis, played by Niamh Algar.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it becomes clear that H is not what he seems, and he is working to take down a group of thieves who are responsible for the robbery that sets off the events of the film. Along the way, H forms alliances with some of the other characters, including a young man named Dougie, played by Eli Brown, whose murder sets the plot in motion.\n\nThe film is known for its non-linear storytelling, and the events of the story are told through a series of flashbacks and present-day scenes. The film's climax features a tense and violent confrontation between H and the group of thieves, and the outcome is far from certain.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Jason Statham as H\n* Holt McCallany as Brad\n* Jeffrey Donovan as Marcus\n* Josh Hartnett as Miles\n* Laz Alonso as Alfonso\n* Scott Eastwood as Ryan\n* Raúl Castillo as Boy Sweat Dave\n* Niamh Algar as Dana Curtis\n* Eli Brown as Dougie\n* Andy García as FBI Agent King (cameo)\n* Post Malone as a truck robber (cameo)\n* Rob Delaney as Fortico's CEO, Blake Halls (cameo)\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was announced in October 2019, with Guy Ritchie set to direct and Jason Statham set to star. The film was produced by Ivan Atkinson and Bill Block, and it was distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States.\n\nFilming began in November 2019, and it took place in both Los Angeles and London. The film's cast was completed in January 2020, with the addition of Raúl Castillo.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Christopher Benstead, and it features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements. The film's editing was handled by James Herbert, and it features a fast-paced and frenetic style.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe film is a remake of the 2004 French film Cash Truck, which was directed by Eric Valette and starred Samuel Le Bihan. The original film was a commercial success, and it was well-received by critics.\n\nGuy Ritchie was drawn to the original film's complex characters and non-linear storytelling, and he saw an opportunity to bring a new perspective to the material. Ritchie worked closely with the original director, Eric Valette, to develop the script and bring the film to life.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released internationally in several countries, beginning on April 22, 2021, including Russia and Australia. It was later released in the United States on May 7, 2021.\n\nThe film was originally set for release in the United States on January 15, 2021, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was later rescheduled for April 23, 2021, but it was delayed two weeks later.\n\nThe film was released in China on May 10, 2021, and it was originally going to be released in the United Kingdom by the British arm of Lionsgate.

The show follows a group of young ghost hunters as they navigate a world where ghosts who are deadly to the touch have been rising from their graves for 50 years.\n\n**Premise**\n\nIn an alternate version of present-day Britain, a phenomenon known as \"The Problem\" has caused the rising of ghosts from their graves. These ghosts, known as \"Deadlights,\" are deadly to the touch and have a profound effect on the living. As a result, technological advances have stopped, and society has regressed to a pre-technological age. People still use cassette recorders, and the internet does not exist. The show follows a group of young ghost hunters, known as \"Lockwood & Co.,\" as they navigate this world and try to understand and combat the Deadlights.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe cast of Lockwood & Co. includes Ruby Stokes, Cameron Chapman, and Ali Hadji-Heshmati as the main characters, Lucy Carlyle, Anthony Lockwood, and George Kent, respectively.

Jack Bandeira, Ben Crompton, Hayley Konadu, Rhianna Dorris, and Paddy Holland also join the cast in supporting roles.\n\n**Main**\n\nThe series is set in London, where the Lockwood & Co. agency is based.

The main characters, Lucy, Anthony, and George, are all members of the agency and work together to hunt and remove the Deadlights. Along the way, they encounter a range of challenges and obstacles, including rival ghost hunters, personal conflicts, and the ever-present threat of the Deadlights.\n\n**Recurring**\n\nThroughout the series, the characters encounter a range of recurring themes and characters. These include the mysterious and sinister forces that seem to be driving the Deadlights, the complex relationships between the main characters, and the challenges of navigating a world where the rules are constantly changing.\n\n**Guest**\n\nThe series features a range of guest characters, including rival ghost hunters, mysterious figures, and supernatural entities. These characters add to the show's sense of mystery and danger, and provide opportunities for the main characters to develop their skills and personalities.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe series consists of eight episodes, each with a unique title and storyline. The episodes are:\n\n1. \"The Boy Who Wasn't There\"\n2. \"The Girl Who Saw Too Much\"\n3. \"The Ghost Who Wasn't a Ghost\"\n4. \"The Boy Who Wasn't Afraid\"\n5. \"The Girl Who Wasn't a Girl\"\n6. \"The Ghost Who Wasn't a Ghost (Again)\"\n7. \"The Boy Who Wasn't a Boy (Anymore)\"\n8. \"The Girl Who Wasn't a Girl (Anymore)\"\n\n**Production**\n\nThe series was filmed in London and surrounding areas, with a range of locations used to create the show's unique and atmospheric world. The production team used a range of techniques, including set design, lighting, and sound effects, to create the show's sense of tension and suspense.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe series features a range of music, including songs by Bauhaus, The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and This Mortal Coil. The music is used to create a sense of atmosphere and mood, and to underscore the show's themes and emotions.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe series received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its unique and atmospheric world, its complex and engaging characters, and its sense of tension and suspense. The show's use of music and sound effects was also widely praised, with many noting its effective use of these elements to create a sense of atmosphere and mood.\n\n**Audience viewership**\n\nThe series was a ratings success, with many viewers tuning in to watch the show. The show's use of social media and online platforms was also successful, with many fans engaging with the show and its characters on these platforms.\n\n**Awards and nominations**\n\nThe series won a number of awards, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Drama Series. The show was also nominated for a number of other awards, including the BAFTA TV Awards and the Critics' Choice Television Awards.\n\n**Cancellation**\n\nThe series was cancelled in May 2023, due to low viewing numbers. The cancellation was met with widespread criticism, with many fans and critics expressing their disappointment and frustration at the decision to cancel the show. The cancellation was also seen as a reflection of Netflix's habit of cancelling shows too quickly, without giving them a chance to develop and grow.\n\nIn conclusion, Lockwood & Co. is a unique and engaging television series that offers a fresh take on the young adult fantasy genre. The show's use of atmospheric settings, complex characters, and suspenseful plotlines makes it a compelling and addictive watch.

by Cronin and Sam Raimi. The film is the tenth installment in the Evil Dead franchise, and serves as a direct sequel to the 2013 film Evil Dead. The film follows a new group of characters as they face a new evil presence that threatens their lives.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Evil Dead franchise has been a staple of horror cinema for over four decades, with a dedicated fan base and a reputation for delivering intense, gory, and often humorous horror experiences. The franchise has undergone various changes over the years, including reboots, remakes, and sequels, but its core concept has remained the same: a group of characters facing an ancient evil that threatens to destroy them all. With Evil Dead Rise, the franchise returns to its roots, offering a new take on the classic horror formula while still honoring its predecessors.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe idea for Evil Dead Rise was first conceived in 2019, when Sam Raimi announced that a new Evil Dead film was in development. Raimi would serve as an executive producer, while Robert G. Tapert would produce and Lee Cronin would write and direct the film. In 2020, it was announced that the film would be titled Evil Dead Now, but later changed to Evil Dead Rise. The film was shot on a tight budget of $19 million, with a majority of the cast and crew being new to the franchise.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe film features a new cast of characters, including Alyssa Sutherland and Lily Sullivan, who play the lead roles of sisters Erin and Ellie. The film also stars Gabrielle Echols, Morgan Davies, and Nell Fisher, who play supporting roles. Mia Challis joins the cast as a mysterious character with a connection to the evil presence.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe film was shot on a mix of practical and digital sets, with a focus on creating a sense of realism and immersion. Cronin has stated that he was proud of the fact that the film was able to create an imaginary building and take audiences on a ride, despite being shot on a relatively low budget.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nThe editing of the film's visual components took over six months to complete, with Cronin working closely with the editor to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. The picture editing process was completed in March 2022, with Cronin tweeting that the film was ready to move on to music composition and sound design. Myk Farmer serves as the film's sound mixer, and Stephen McKeon was announced to be composing the score in April 2022.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score is composed by Stephen McKeon, who has previously collaborated with Cronin on the 2019 film The Hole in the Ground. The score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on creating a sense of tension and unease.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally set for a streaming-only release on HBO Max, but was switched to a theatrical release in August 2022 due to positive test screenings and the restructuring plan for film distribution at Warner Bros. Pictures. The film was theatrically released in the United States on April 21, 2023, by Warner Bros. The film was also released digitally on May 9, 2023, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 27, 2023.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe film was available to stream on Max beginning June 23, 2023.

October 2022, she became patron to Preet Chandi, a British Army medical officer who aimed to complete a 1,000-mile solo expedition in the South Pole after finishing a 700-mile journey in the continent earlier that year [198]\n\n\nHealth and medical initiatives\nIn her capacity as patron of Action on Addiction, Catherine has occasionally made visits to its centres, spending time with recovering addicts [199] [200] [201] In October 2012, she, alongside Action on Addiction, launched the M-PACT programme (Moving Parents and Children Together), one of the only UK programmes to focus specifically on the impact of drug addiction on families [202] In June 2021, Catherine was announced as patron of The Forward Trust after its merger with Action on Addiction [203] As patron, she launched a campaign titled \"Taking Action on Addiction\" [204]\n\n\nPhotography\nCatherine has called herself an \"enthusiastic amateur photographer\" [220] and has taken official portraits of her children, as well as other members of the royal family [221] In 2019 she supported workshops run by the Royal Photographic Society in partnership with Action for Children to highlight the effect of photography in expressing thoughts in young people [222] As patron of the Royal Photographic Society she and other photographers took part in an exhibition that marked 75 years since the end of the Holocaust [223] Photos taken by Catherine of the Holocaust survivors were later included in an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum [224] Catherine curated an exhibition of Victorian photography at the National Portrait Gallery with a thematic focus on childhood [225] In May 2020, she launched \"Hold Still\", a project to capture people's life during lockdown, which garnered 31,000 submissions [226] In October 2020, the selected portraits were displayed on 112 public sites, including billboards, murals, and posters, across 80 towns and cities [227] The photographs were later published in a book titled Hold Still: A Portrait of Our Nation in 2020, with a foreword written by Catherine, on 7 May 2021 [228]\n\n\nCommunity causes\nCatherine has been hosting a Christmas carol concert called Together At Christmas annually at Westminster Abbey since December 2021 with the theme varying each year [229]\n\n\nMental health advocacy\nCatherine has tackled issues surrounding mental health and disabilities and has previously made visits to charities and hospitals such as St Thomas' Hospital and the Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute to spend time with mothers and children who deal with these issues [235] [236] She has also been credited with raising national awareness of children's mental health; Benita Refson, president of Place2Be, has praised her work, saying that she would \"shine the spotlight on child mental health\", while Peter Fonagy, CEO of the Anna Freud Centre has called her one of the most important figures in the field, and stated that \"to the millions of children who have been suffering in silence, she is their voice\" [237] [238] In recognition of their work with charities concerned with children's mental health, Catherine and William were awarded the Gold Blue Peter badge, an award previously granted to Queen Elizabeth II [239] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, Catherine, William and Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together\" in April 2016 [240] She later voluntarily talked about her struggles as a mother, and admitted that she suffered a \"lack of confidence\" and \"feelings of ignorance\" during certain periods of time [240] [241]\n\n\nEarly years and childhood development\nDuring the initial years of her charity work, Catherine became interested in the connection between the first five years of childhood and conditions such as homelessness, mental health, and addiction in later life [263] In March 2018, she hosted a symposium with the Royal Society of Medicine, focusing on children's health, and launched the Early Years Intervention Support initiative [264] In May that year, she established the Early Years Steering Group [265] [266] In January 2020, Catherine launched \"5 Big Questions on the Under 5's\", a nationwide survey on development during early years [267] The survey was conducted by Ipsos MORI and contained \"further qualitative and ethnographic research\" on the early years [268] It received over 500,000 responses [269] The results of the survey were released in November 2020 [270] The findings outlined five key topics surrounding early childhood, including parental mental health and wider community health and support [271] In July 2020, she supported and assisted in the development of BBC's \"Tiny Happy People\" initiative, providing free digital resources to parents with young children [272] In August 2020, she headed a donation drive to benefit baby banks nationwide which spurred over 10,000 donations [273] [274] In June 2021, Catherine launched the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood to conduct work, research, and campaigns with other organisations on issues surrounding the early years [275]\n\n\nPublic image\nCatherine, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous \"best dressed\" lists [282] She topped Tatler's Best Dressed List in 2022, [283] and was ranked first by the magazine on its list of the most glamorous European royals in 2024 [284] Her style has evolved from more conservative choices in the early years of her public life to a sophisticated and elegant wardrobe, often featuring designs by Alexander McQueen, Jenny Packham, Catherine Walker and international designers such as Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci [285] [286] [287] The \"Kate Middleton effect\" is the trend that she is reported to have had in sales of particular products and brands [288] [289] [290] [291] In 2021 it was reported that Catherine boosted the British fashion industry up to £1 billion within a year [288]\n\n\nFashion\nCatherine, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous \"best dressed\" lists [282] She topped Tatler's Best Dressed List in 2022,

appeal and influence, a view echoed by journalist Camilla Tominey who described her as \"the monarchy's greatest asset\" [292] [293] Rhonda Garelick of The New York Times has also noted her ability to balance modernity with traditional royal norms [294] Speaking to The Times on Catherine's 40th birthday, her aides stated that she does not accept \"advice on a PR basis\" and will \"never do something because she thinks the media will like it.\" [295] Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, her and William's former private secretary, stated that \"she has that almost old-fashioned, Queen Mother attitude to drama – she just doesn't do it.\" [295]\n\n\nPrivacy and the media\nThe death of Diana, Princess of Wales, while being chased by paparazzi in August 1997 [302] has influenced Catherine's and William's attitude towards the media [303] They have often requested that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected [303]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nUpon her marriage in April 2011, Catherine became a princess of the United Kingdom, as well as Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn, and Baroness Carrickfergus; she also received the style of Royal Highness [346] [347]

Leeds, West Yorkshire [358] The historian Robert Lacey describes Michael Middleton as  having aristocratic kinship; his grandmother, Olive Christiana  Middleton, was close to her second cousin  Baroness Airedale (1868–1942) [359] [360] Both Catherine's paternal great-grandmother Olive Middleton (née Lupton) and her first-cousin-once-removed Baroness von Schunck (née Kate Lupton) grew up at Potternewton Hall Estate, the seat of the Lupton family, who are described as landed gentry and, as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911 [361] [362] [363] Four successive generations of Catherine's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate: Catherine's great-grandmother Olive Middleton; her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton; his mother,

The film is based on the 1957 children's book of the same name by Dr. Seuss. The story follows the Grinch, a grouchy and isolated creature who lives on Mount Crumpit with his dog Max. The Grinch despises the cheerful residents of Whoville and their love for Christmas, which he sees as a noisy and chaotic holiday.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the town of Whoville, the human-like people called Whos are filled with excitement about celebrating Christmas. However, the only one who is not thrilled is the grumpy, cantankerous, and green-furred Grinch, born with a heart being \"two-sizes too small.\" He lives in his cave with his dog, Max, and only goes into Whoville to buy groceries and harass the Whos. The Grinch decides to take matters into his own hands and steal Christmas from the Whos by disguising himself as Santa Claus and sneaking into Whoville on Christmas Eve.\n\nHowever, the Grinch's plans are foiled when he discovers the true meaning of Christmas, which is the love and kindness that the Whos share with each other. He returns the stolen gifts and decorations, and the Whos welcome him with open arms. The Grinch's heart grows three sizes, and he becomes a part of the Whoville community.\n\n## Voice Cast\n\nThe film features an all-star voice cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character, Rashida Jones as Donna Who, Cameron Seely as Cindy Lou Who, and Kenan Thompson as the Mayor of Whoville.

{"title": "Alex_Ferguson", "content": "\nEarly life\nAlexander Chapman Ferguson [8] was born at his grandmother's home on Shieldhall Road in the Govan district of Glasgow on 31 December 1941, the son of Elizabeth (née Hardie) and Alexander Beaton Ferguson His father was a plater's helper in the shipbuilding industry [9] He grew up in a tenement at 667 Govan Road, which has since been demolished, where he lived with his parents and his younger brother Martin, who also became a footballer [10] He attended Broomloan Road Primary School and later Govan High School [11] He began his football career with Harmony Row Boys Club in Govan, [12] [13] before progressing to Drumchapel Amateurs, a youth club with a strong reputation for producing senior footballers [14] He also took an apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, being appointed a union shop steward [12]\n\n\nPlaying career\nFerguson's playing career began as an amateur with Queen's Park, where he made his debut as a striker, aged 16 [15] He described his first match as a \"nightmare\", [16] but scored Queen's Park's goal in a 2–1 defeat against Stranraer Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park was the 7–1 defeat away to Queen of the South on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park

international Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park goalscorer [17]\n\n\nInternational\nFerguson's only involvement with the Scotland national team was during an overseas tour in 1967 For many years none of the tour matches were recognised by the Scottish Football Association as full internationals, and so Ferguson was deemed to have never played for Scotland A BBC Sport article in June 2020 identified him as one of the best Scottish players to have never played a full international [22] The SFA announced in October 2021 that some of the tour matches would be reclassified as full internationals, which meant that Ferguson was belatedly awarded an international cap [3]\n\n\nManagerial career\nIn June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32 It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not have a single goalkeeper at the time [33] He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley later saying he had \"never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start.\" [34]\n\n\nEast Stirlingshire\nIn

the time [33] He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley later saying he had \"never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start.\" [34]\n\n\nSt Mirren\nIn October 1974, Ferguson was invited to manage St Mirren While they were below East Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from Jock Stein [35]\n\n\nAberdeen\nFerguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing Billy McNeill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season [42] Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper [43] The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.\n\n\nLate 1970s\nFerguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing Billy McNeill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season [42] Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper [43] The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.\n\n\n1980s and silverware\nAberdeen had started the 1979–80 season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5–0 win on the final day It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying: \"That was the achievement which united us I finally had the players believing in me\" [45]\n\n\nEuropean success and Scottish national side\nFerguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83 They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich, [52] [53] who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in the previous round [54] [55] According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition, [56] which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983 [57] Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that \"he'd done something worthwhile with his life\" [58] This was followed up with victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup champions, were beaten 2–0 over two legs [59] [60] Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1–0 victory over Rangers, [61] but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a \"disgraceful performance\" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted [62]\n\n\nManchester United\nFerguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986 [73] He was initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over [74]\n\n\nAppointment and first FA Cup title\nFerguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986 [73] He was initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over [74]\n\n\nUnited's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in 1990–91, they were still inconsistent and finished sixth There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6–2 demolition of Arsenal at Highbury, but results like an early 2–1 loss at newly promoted Sunderland, a 4–0 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2–0 home defeat by Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect Ryan Giggs made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go [93] [94]\n\n\n1993–95: Double win and loss\nThe 1993–94 season brought more success Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder Roy Keane to the ranks for a British record fee of £3.75 million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career [109] United led the 1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish [110] Ferguson was the first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of the 1993–94 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993 [111] Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994 United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3–1 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4–0 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double, following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983 [112] [113] [110]\n\n\n1995–98\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought First Paul Ince moved to Internazionale of Italy for £7.5 million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a £1.5 million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton [119] [120] [121] Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team [9] [10] And so the 1995–96 season began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings [122] [123]\n\n\n1998–99: Treble success\nUnited opened the 1998–99 season with a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in the 1998 FA Charity Shield [147] The beating did not concern Ferguson, though he described his team's defeat by Arsenal in September 1998 as \"a lot less tolerable\" In December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn Rovers Ferguson instructed Eric Harrison and Les Kershaw to find suitable replacements, \"in terms of coaching ability and work ethic.\" Both recommended Steve McClaren, the assistant to Jim Smith at Derby County McClaren was Ferguson's initial choice and appointed him in February 1999 His first game as assistant was United's 8–1 victory over Nottingham Forest [148]\n\n\n1999–2002: Title hat-trick, retirement plan\nSchmeichel's decision to leave United after eight seasons prompted Ferguson to bring in replacements: Mark Bosnich from Aston Villa and Italian Massimo Taibi The latter featured in four matches, the last of which a 5–0 defeat at Chelsea in October 1999; he was not selected again by Ferguson United ended the 1999–2000 league season as champions, with just three defeats and a record points margin of 18 [158] In December 1999, the club beat Palmeiras in Tokyo to win the Intercontinental Cup, [159] but a month later exited at the group stage of the inaugural Club World Championship, [160] [161] although Ferguson stated the tournament was \"fantastic\" [162] United failed to retain the Champions League, as they lost in the quarter-final stage to eventual winners Real Madrid [163] [164] Ferguson sought to strengthen his squad and signed Fabien Barthez from Monaco for £7.8 million [165] He also monitored the progress of Ruud van Nistelrooy, \"a striker of the highest calibre\" [166] He met the player and his agent in Manchester to discuss formalities and was informed of Van Nistelrooy's troubled right knee [166] Ferguson was not agitated by this; he recalled from experience a similar niggle that did not stop his playing career [166] Van Nistelrooy, however, failed his medical, but Ferguson reassured him that \"we might yet find a way out of the nightmare\" [166] The deal was resurrected in April 2001 for a British record transfer fee of £19 million [167]\n\n\n2002–2006: Rebuilding and transition\nIn June 2002, Ferguson appointed Carlos Queiroz as his new assistant [183] The recommendation came from Andy Roxburgh, at a time when United began scouting for southern-hemisphere footballers and wanted a multilingual coach Ferguson was so impressed with Queiroz after their first meeting, he offered him the job \"right away\" In July 2002, United paid £29.3 million for Leeds United defender Rio Ferdinand The club broke the British transfer record once more, though this did not concern Ferguson: \"We have the right to try and improve ourselves and there's nothing wrong with that.\" [184]\n\n\nSecond Champions League trophy\nIn 2006, Michael Carrick was signed to take Roy Keane's place in the team for a fee that eventually rose to £18 million [203] United started the season well, and for the first time ever won their first four Premier League games, United's best start since 1985 [203] [204] They set the early pace in the Premier League and never relinquished top spot from the tenth match of the 38-game season [205] The January 2006 signings had a huge impact on United's performances – Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidić came in to form a solid back line along with Rio Ferdinand and skipper Gary Neville [206] The signing of Carrick brought stability and further creativity in the United midfield, forming an effective partnership with Paul Scholes Park Ji-sung and Ryan Giggs both underlined their value to the first team squad by adding significant pace and incisiveness in attack with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo [citation needed]\n\n\nWorld champions and further league titles\nAlthough the team had a slow start to the 2008–09 season, [232] United won the Premier League with a game to spare, [233] making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the top division three times consecutively, on two separate occasions Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008–09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total [234] They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless draw in the final against Tottenham, after becoming the first British club to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2008 [235]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he had decided to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador [248] [249] The Guardian announced it was the \"end of an era\", [250] while UEFA president Michel Platini referred to Ferguson as \"a true visionary\" [251] Former Manchester United players Paul Ince and Bryan Robson agreed that Ferguson would be \"a hard act to follow\" [252] Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer said, \"His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable.\" [253] Ferguson revealed that he had in fact decided that he was going to retire back in December 2012 and that it had been very difficult not to reveal his plans [254] Ferguson's decision to retire saw United shares fall 5% on the New York Stock Exchange [255]\n\n\nControversies\nGordon Strachan was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club FC Köln without telling Ferguson [268] Ferguson said that he believed although \"there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me\" [268] Strachan did not sign for Köln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984 [268] Strachan liked the move because he felt that Ron Atkinson treated him as an adult, unlike Ferguson [269] Strachan was still with the club when Ferguson was appointed manager in November 1986 [268] Ferguson thought that Strachan did not play for United with the same confidence he had in Scotland and subsequently sold him to Leeds United in 1989 [268] Strachan enjoyed significant success with Leeds as a veteran player, helping them win the 1991–92 English league championship in a title race with Ferguson's United [268]\n\n\nGordon Strachan\nGordon Strachan was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club FC Köln without telling Ferguson [268] Ferguson said that he believed although \"there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me\" [268] Strachan did not sign for Köln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984 [268] Strachan

veteran player, helping them win the 1991–92 English league championship in a title race with Ferguson's United [268]\n\n\nDavid Beckham\nIn February 2003, Ferguson was involved in a dressing room argument with Manchester United player David Beckham [271] Ferguson allegedly kicked a football boot in frustration, which hit Beckham in the face and caused a minor injury [272] Ferguson apologised to Beckham, who was transferred to Real Madrid later that year [272]\n\n\nChampions League draw fixing\nOn 5 April 2003, Ferguson claimed that the Champions League draw was fixed in favour of Spanish and Italian teams [271] UEFA charged Ferguson for bringing the game into disrepute with his comments [273] Ferguson apologised for his remarks and wrote a letter to UEFA in explanation, but he was fined 10,000 Swiss francs (£4,600) by the governing body [273]\n\n\nRock of Gibraltar\nIn 2003, Ferguson launched legal action against the then major Manchester United shareholder John Magnier over stud rights for race horse Rock of Gibraltar [274] Magnier counter-sued Ferguson [275] by filing a \"Motion to Comply\" requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar's stud fees The legal issues were further compounded by Magnier being a significant shareholder in the football club managed by Ferguson at the time [276] Magnier requested that \"99 Questions\" be answered over Ferguson's transfer dealings, including those of Jaap Stam, Juan Sebastián Verón, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kléberson [277] The case was eventually settled out of Court [276]\n\n\nBBC\n\nFerguson refused to give interviews to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004 [278] According to an article in The Independent, the documentary had \"portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market\" The same newspaper article made it clear that Jason was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Alex Ferguson as saying: \n\nReferees\nFerguson has received numerous punishments for abusing and publicly criticising match officials when he has perceived them to be at fault:\n\n\n'Fergie Time'\nIt has also been suggested that Ferguson's intimidation of referees resulted in so-called \"Fergie Time\": that is, unusually generous injury time being added in matches where Manchester United were behind The phrase is at least as old as 1998, [288] but the concept first appeared on 10 April 1993 when Steve Bruce scored a 97th-minute goal (seventh minute of injury time added on by the referee) against Sheffield Wednesday to win the game for United: they went top of the league with this win and remained there until the season ended [107] The term got wider coverage when United came from behind to win the 1999 UEFA Champions League final with two goals in injury time [289] [290] [291]\n\n\nLegacy\nMany of Ferguson's former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including Tony Fitzpatrick, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan, Mark McGhee, Willie Miller, Neale Cooper, Bryan Gunn, Eric Black, Billy Stark, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Chris Casper, Mark Robins, Darren Ferguson, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Henning Berg, Andrei Kanchelskis, Michael Appleton, Ryan Giggs, David Healy, Gabriel Heinze, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and Phil Neville [294] [295] Three of these have subsequently managed Manchester United: Giggs (interim player-manager in 2014), Solskjær (2018 to 2021), and Carrick (interim manager in 2021).\n\n\nPersonal life\nFerguson lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and was married to Cathy Holding from 1966 until her death in October 2023 [306] [307] They had three sons together: Mark (born 1968); and twins Darren, [308] who was also a professional footballer and currently the manager of Peterborough United; and Jason (born 1972), who runs an events management company [citation needed] Jason directed the 2021 documentary Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In about his father.\n\n\nHonours\nSt

Vice-President of the National Football Museum, based in Manchester, [331] and a member of the Executive Committee of the League Managers Association [332] On 5 November 2011, the Old Trafford North

Shieldhall Road in the Govan district of Glasgow on 31 December 1941, the son of Elizabeth (née Hardie) and Alexander Beaton Ferguson His father was a plater's helper in the shipbuilding industry [9] He grew up in a tenement at 667 Govan Road, which has since been demolished, where he lived with his parents and his younger brother Martin, who also became a footballer [10] He attended Broomloan Road Primary School and later Govan High School [11] He began his football career with Harmony Row Boys Club in Govan, [12] [13] before progressing to Drumchapel Amateurs, a youth club with a strong reputation for producing senior footballers [14] He also took an apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, being appointed a union shop steward [12]\n\n\nPlaying career\nFerguson's playing career began as an amateur with Queen's Park, where he made his debut as a striker, aged 16 [15] He described his first match as a \"nightmare\", [16] but scored Queen's Park's goal in a 2–1 defeat against Stranraer Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park was the 7–1 defeat away to Queen of the South on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park goalscorer [17]\n\n\nClub\nFerguson's playing career began as an amateur with Queen's Park, where he made his debut as a striker, aged 16 [15] He described his first match as a \"nightmare\", [16] but scored Queen's Park's goal in a 2–1 defeat against Stranraer Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park was the 7–1 defeat away to Queen of the South on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park goalscorer [17]\n\n\nInternational\nFerguson's only involvement with the Scotland national team was during an overseas tour in 1967 For many years none of the tour matches were recognised by the Scottish Football Association as full internationals, and so Ferguson was deemed to have never played for Scotland A BBC Sport article in June 2020 identified him as one of the best Scottish players to have never played a full international [22] The SFA announced in October 2021 that some of the tour matches would be reclassified as full internationals, which meant that Ferguson was belatedly awarded an international cap [3]\n\n\nManagerial career\nIn June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32 It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not have a single goalkeeper at the time [33] He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley later saying he had \"never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start.\" [34]\n\n\nEast Stirlingshire\nIn June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32 It was a part-time job that paid £40 per week, and the club did not have a single goalkeeper at the time [33] He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley later saying he had \"never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start.\" [34]\n\n\nSt Mirren\nIn October 1974, Ferguson was invited to manage St Mirren While they were below East Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from Jock Stein [35]\n\n\nAberdeen\nFerguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing Billy McNeill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season [42] Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper [43] The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.\n\n\nLate 1970s\nFerguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978, replacing Billy McNeill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage Celtic Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season [42] Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper [43] The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.\n\n\n1980s and silverware\nAberdeen had started the 1979–80 season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5–0 win on the final day It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying: \"That was the achievement which united us I finally had the players believing in me\" [45]\n\n\nEuropean success and Scottish national side\nFerguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982–83 They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich, [52] [53] who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 in the previous round [54] [55] According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition, [56] which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983 [57] Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that \"he'd done something worthwhile with his life\" [58] This was followed up with victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup champions, were beaten 2–0 over two legs [59] [60] Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1–0 victory over Rangers, [61] but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a \"disgraceful performance\" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted [62]\n\n\nManchester United\nFerguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986 [73] He was initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over [74]\n\n\nAppointment and first FA Cup title\nFerguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986 [73] He was initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over [74]\n\n\nUnited's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in 1990–91, they were still inconsistent and finished sixth There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6–2 demolition of Arsenal at Highbury, but results like an early 2–1 loss at newly promoted Sunderland, a 4–0 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2–0 home defeat by Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect Ryan Giggs made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go [93] [94]\n\n\n1993–95: Double win and loss\nThe 1993–94 season brought more success Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder Roy Keane to the ranks for a British record fee of £3.75 million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career [109] United led the 1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish [110] Ferguson was the first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of the 1993–94 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993 [111] Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994 United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3–1 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4–0 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double, following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983 [112] [113] [110]\n\n\n1995–98\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought First Paul Ince moved to Internazionale of Italy for £7.5 million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a £1.5 million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton [119] [120] [121] Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team [9] [10] And so the 1995–96 season began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings [122] [123]\n\n\n1998–99: Treble success\nUnited opened the 1998–99 season with a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in the 1998 FA Charity Shield [147] The beating did not concern Ferguson, though he described his team's defeat by Arsenal in September 1998 as \"a lot less tolerable\" In December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn Rovers Ferguson instructed Eric Harrison and Les Kershaw to find suitable replacements, \"in terms of coaching ability and work ethic.\" Both recommended Steve McClaren, the assistant to Jim Smith at Derby County McClaren was Ferguson's initial choice and appointed him in February 1999 His first game as assistant was United's 8–1 victory over Nottingham Forest [148]\n\n\n1999–2002: Title hat-trick, retirement plan\nSchmeichel's decision to leave United after eight seasons prompted Ferguson to bring in replacements: Mark Bosnich from Aston Villa and Italian Massimo Taibi The latter featured in four matches, the last of which a 5–0 defeat at Chelsea in October 1999; he was not selected again by Ferguson United ended the 1999–2000 league season as champions, with just three defeats and a record points margin of 18 [158] In December 1999, the club beat Palmeiras in Tokyo to win the Intercontinental Cup, [159] but a month later exited at the group stage of the inaugural Club World Championship, [160] [161] although Ferguson stated the tournament was \"fantastic\" [162] United failed to retain the Champions League, as they lost in the quarter-final stage to eventual winners Real Madrid [163] [164] Ferguson sought to strengthen his squad and signed Fabien Barthez from Monaco for £7.8 million [165] He also monitored the progress of Ruud van Nistelrooy, \"a striker of the highest calibre\" [166] He met the player and his agent in Manchester to discuss formalities and was informed of Van Nistelrooy's troubled right knee [166] Ferguson was not agitated by this; he recalled from experience a similar niggle that did not stop his playing career [166] Van Nistelrooy, however, failed his medical, but Ferguson reassured him that \"we might yet find a way out of the nightmare\" [166] The deal was resurrected in April 2001 for a British record transfer fee of £19 million [167]\n\n\n2002–2006: Rebuilding and transition\nIn June 2002, Ferguson appointed Carlos Queiroz as his new assistant [183] The recommendation came from Andy Roxburgh, at a time when United began scouting for southern-hemisphere footballers and wanted a multilingual coach Ferguson was so impressed with Queiroz after their first meeting, he offered him the job \"right away\" In July 2002, United paid £29.3 million for Leeds United defender Rio Ferdinand The club broke the British transfer record once more, though this did not concern Ferguson: \"We have the right to try and improve ourselves and there's nothing wrong with that.\" [184]\n\n\nSecond Champions League trophy\nIn 2006, Michael Carrick was signed to take Roy Keane's place in the team for a fee that eventually rose to £18 million [203] United started the season well, and for the first time ever won their first four Premier League games, United's best start since 1985 [203] [204] They set the early pace in the Premier League and never relinquished top spot from the tenth match of the 38-game season [205] The January 2006 signings had a huge impact on United's performances – Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidić came in to form a solid back line along with Rio Ferdinand and skipper Gary Neville [206] The signing of Carrick brought stability and further creativity in the United midfield, forming an effective partnership with Paul Scholes Park Ji-sung and Ryan Giggs both underlined their value to the first team squad by adding significant pace and incisiveness in attack with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo [citation needed]\n\n\nWorld champions and further league titles\nAlthough the team had a slow start to the 2008–09 season, [232] United won the Premier League with a game to spare, [233] making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the top division three times consecutively, on two separate occasions Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008–09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total [234] They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless draw in the final against Tottenham, after becoming the first British club to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2008 [235]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he had decided to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador [248] [249] The Guardian announced it was the \"end of an era\", [250] while UEFA president Michel Platini referred to Ferguson as \"a true visionary\" [251] Former Manchester United players Paul Ince and Bryan Robson agreed that Ferguson would be \"a hard act to follow\" [252] Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer said, \"His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable.\" [253] Ferguson revealed that he had in fact decided that he was going to retire back in December 2012 and that it had been very difficult not to reveal his plans [254] Ferguson's decision to retire saw United shares fall 5% on the New York Stock Exchange [255]\n\n\nControversies\nGordon Strachan was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club FC Köln without telling Ferguson [268] Ferguson said that he believed although \"there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me\" [268] Strachan did not sign for Köln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984 [268] Strachan liked the move because he felt that Ron Atkinson treated him as an adult, unlike Ferguson [269] Strachan was still with the club when Ferguson was appointed manager in November 1986 [268] Ferguson thought that Strachan did not play for United with the same confidence he had in Scotland and subsequently sold him to Leeds United in 1989 [268] Strachan enjoyed significant success with Leeds as a veteran player, helping them win the 1991–92 English league championship in a title race with Ferguson's United [268]\n\n\nGordon Strachan\nGordon Strachan was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club FC Köln without telling Ferguson [268] Ferguson said that he believed although \"there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me\" [268] Strachan did not sign for Köln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984 [268] Strachan liked the move because he felt that Ron Atkinson treated him as an adult, unlike Ferguson [269] Strachan was still with the club

in 1989 [268] Strachan enjoyed significant success with Leeds as a veteran player, helping them win the 1991–92 English league championship in a title race with Ferguson's United [268]\n\n\nDavid Beckham\nIn February 2003, Ferguson was involved in a dressing room argument with Manchester United player David Beckham [271] Ferguson allegedly kicked a football boot in frustration, which hit Beckham in the face and caused a minor injury [272] Ferguson apologised to Beckham, who was transferred to Real Madrid later that year [272]\n\n\nChampions League draw fixing\nOn 5 April 2003, Ferguson claimed that the Champions League draw was fixed in favour of Spanish and Italian teams [271] UEFA charged Ferguson for bringing the game into disrepute with his comments [273] Ferguson apologised for his remarks and wrote a letter to UEFA in explanation, but he was fined 10,000 Swiss francs (£4,600) by the governing body [273]\n\n\nRock of Gibraltar\nIn 2003, Ferguson launched legal action against the then major Manchester United shareholder John Magnier over stud rights for race horse Rock of Gibraltar [274] Magnier counter-sued Ferguson [275] by filing a \"Motion to Comply\" requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar's stud fees The legal issues were further compounded by Magnier being a significant shareholder in the football club managed by Ferguson at the time [276] Magnier requested that \"99 Questions\" be answered over Ferguson's transfer dealings, including those of Jaap Stam, Juan Sebastián Verón, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kléberson [277] The case was eventually settled out of Court [276]\n\n\nBBC\n\nFerguson refused to give interviews to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004 [278] According to an article in The Independent, the documentary had \"portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market\" The same newspaper article made it clear that Jason was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Alex Ferguson as saying: \n\nReferees\nFerguson has received numerous punishments for abusing and publicly criticising match officials when he has perceived them to be at fault:\n\n\n'Fergie Time'\nIt has also been suggested that Ferguson's intimidation of referees resulted in so-called \"Fergie Time\": that is, unusually generous injury time being added in matches where Manchester United were behind The phrase is at least as old as 1998, [288] but the concept first appeared on 10 April 1993 when Steve Bruce scored a 97th-minute goal (seventh minute of injury time added on by the referee) against Sheffield Wednesday to win the game for United: they went top of the league with this win and remained there until the season ended [107] The term got wider coverage when United came from behind to win the 1999 UEFA Champions League final with two goals in injury time [289] [290] [291]\n\n\nLegacy\nMany of Ferguson's former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including Tony Fitzpatrick, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan, Mark McGhee, Willie Miller, Neale Cooper, Bryan Gunn, Eric Black, Billy Stark, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Chris Casper, Mark Robins, Darren Ferguson, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Henning Berg, Andrei Kanchelskis, Michael Appleton, Ryan Giggs, David Healy, Gabriel Heinze, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and Phil Neville [294] [295] Three of these have subsequently managed Manchester United: Giggs (interim player-manager in 2014), Solskjær (2018 to 2021), and Carrick (interim manager in 2021).\n\n\nPersonal life\nFerguson lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and was married to Cathy Holding from 1966 until her death in October 2023 [306] [307] They had three sons together: Mark (born 1968); and twins Darren, [308] who was also a professional footballer and currently the manager of Peterborough United; and Jason (born 1972), who runs an events management company [citation needed] Jason directed the 2021 documentary Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In about his father.\n\n\nHonours\nSt Johnstone\n\n\nPlayer\nSt Johnstone\n\n\nManager\nFerguson was made an Inaugural Inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager [329] In 2003, Ferguson became an inaugural recipient of the FA Coaching Diploma, awarded to all coaches who had at least ten years' experience of being a manager or head coach [330] He is the Vice-President of the National Football Museum, based in Manchester, [331] and a member of the Executive Committee of the League Managers Association [332] On 5 November 2011, the Old Trafford North Stand was officially renamed the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand in honour of his 25 years as manager of Manchester United [333]\n\n\nOrders and special awards\nFerguson has received at least eight honorary degrees [353] These Include:\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nFerguson has received at least eight honorary

Born in Stockholm, Sweden, Nordegren comes from a family of politicians and journalists. Her early life and education laid the foundation for her future endeavors, which took her from modeling to becoming a prominent figure in the sports world.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nElin Nordegren was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to a family with a strong background in politics and journalism. Her mother, Barbro Holmberg, was a Swedish politician who served as the Minister for Migration and Asylum Policy, as well as the Governor of Gävleborg County. Her father, Thomas Nordegren, is a radio journalist who has worked as a bureau chief in Washington, D.C. Nordegren has an elder brother, Axel, and a twin sister, Josefin Nordegren.

Despite this, Woods remained interested in Nordegren, and the two eventually became engaged in 2003. The engagement took place at the luxury Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa during the Presidents Cup tournament.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nNordegren's marriage to Tiger Woods was a high-profile union that captivated the world's attention. The couple had a son, Charlie Axel Woods, in 2007. However, their marriage was marred by infidelity on Woods' part, which was revealed in 2009. The scandal led to a very public breakdown of their marriage, with Woods announcing an indefinite break from golf to work on their relationship. Unfortunately, the efforts were unsuccessful, and the couple finalized their divorce in 2010. The divorce was highly publicized, with many of the details of their marriage and its breakdown being subject to scrutiny.\n\n**Divorce**\n\nThe divorce between Nordegren and Woods was a highly contested and very public process. Nordegren's legal team included her sister, Josefin, who is licensed to practice law in England and Sweden, as well as several of Josefin's U.S colleagues at international law firm McGuireWoods. The divorce was finalized in the Bay County Circuit Court in Panama City, Florida, on August 23, 2010.\n\n**After Divorce from Woods**\n\nAfter her divorce from Woods, Nordegren kept a relatively low profile. However, in 2019, it was announced that she was expecting her first child with former National Football League player Jordan Cameron. Nordegren gave birth to a son, Arthur, in October 2019. The couple had their second child, a daughter, in December 2022. In addition to her work as a mother, Nordegren has been involved in various philanthropic efforts, including supporting children's charities.\n\n**Personal Life After Divorce**\n\nSince her divorce from Woods, Nordegren has focused on raising her children and rebuilding her life. She has been romantically linked to several men, including Jordan Cameron, with whom she has three children. Nordegren's personal life has been subject to scrutiny, but she has maintained a relatively low profile. Despite the challenges she has faced, Nordegren has emerged as a strong and independent woman, determined to build a happy and fulfilling life for herself and her children.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nElin Nordegren's legacy extends beyond her marriage to Tiger Woods. As a model, she has worked with several high-profile brands and has appeared on the covers of numerous magazines. As a mother, she has been devoted to raising her children and providing them with a stable and loving home. Nordegren's experiences, both positive and negative, have shaped her into a strong and resilient woman. Despite the challenges she has faced, she remains a prominent figure in the public eye, and her legacy continues to inspire and fascinate people around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Elin_Nordegren\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nNordegren was born in Stockholm Her mother, politician Barbro Holmberg, is the former Swedish migration and asylum policy minister as well as the former Governor of Gävleborg County Her father, Thomas Nordegren, is a radio journalist who has served as a bureau chief in Washington, D.C [2] She has an elder brother, Axel, and a twin sister Josefin Nordegren [3] [4] Nordegren and her sister had summer jobs as cashiers in supermarkets to finance their studies [5] Elin started modeling in 2000, and appeared on the cover of Cafe Sport magazine in the summer of 2000 [6]\n\n\nPersonal life\nNordegren took a job in Champagne, a Stockholm clothing store, where she met Mia Parnevik, wife of Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who hired Nordegren as the au pair to their children, the job requiring her to move full-time to the U.S [10] Tiger Woods was introduced to her during the 2001 Open Championship For the previous year, Woods had asked to be introduced to Nordegren, who was seeing someone else at the time \"She had no interest in Tiger and he was OK with that,\" Mia Parnevik said \"There was a big line of single golfers wanting to meet her They were gaga over her.\" [11] At the time, she had hopes of becoming a child psychologist In November 2003, Woods and Nordegren attended the Presidents Cup tournament in South Africa and became officially engaged when Woods proposed at the luxury Shamwari Game Reserve.\n\n\nMarriage and family\nNordegren took a job in Champagne, a Stockholm clothing store, where she met Mia Parnevik, wife of Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who hired Nordegren as the au pair to their children, the job requiring her to move full-time to the U.S [10] Tiger Woods was introduced to her during the 2001 Open Championship For the previous year, Woods had asked to be introduced to Nordegren, who was seeing someone else at the time \"She had no interest in Tiger and he was OK with that,\" Mia Parnevik said \"There was a big line of single golfers wanting to meet her They were gaga over her.\" [11] At the time, she had hopes of becoming a child psychologist In November 2003, Woods and Nordegren attended the Presidents Cup tournament in South Africa and became officially engaged when Woods proposed at the luxury Shamwari Game Reserve.\n\n\nDivorce\nIn December 2009, her marriage to Woods was the subject of extensive media coverage after Woods admitted to infidelity, which had been revealed following his single-vehicle accident near the family's Florida home [22]  After Woods' infidelity was revealed, Jesper Parnevik was quoted as having said, \"I'm kind of filled with sorrow for Elin since me and my wife are at fault for hooking her up with him, and we probably thought he was a better guy than he is.\" Woods announced he would take an \"indefinite break\" from golf to work on his marriage [22] These efforts were unsuccessful, however, as Nordegren and Woods finalized their divorce in the Bay County Circuit Court in Panama City, Florida, on 23 August 2010 [23] Nordegren's legal team included her sister, Josefin (who is licensed to practice law in England and Sweden) and several of Josefin's U.S colleagues at international law firm McGuireWoods [24]\n\n\nAfter divorce from Woods\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Nordegren was expecting her first child with former National Football League player Jordan Cameron [27] Nordegren gave birth to a son, Arthur, in October 2019 [28] In December 2022, Nordegren gave birth to their second child, reportedly a daughter [29] The couple also has a third child together [30]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a variant of the virus that causes the respiratory disease COVID-19 and is known to have several distinct mutations.\n\n**Mutations**\nThe Lambda genome has the following amino acid mutations, all of which are in the virus's spike protein code: G75V, T76I, Δ246-252, L452Q, F490S, D614G, and T859N. These mutations are of particular interest because they may affect the virus's ability to infect cells, its transmissibility, and its severity.\n\nThe G75V mutation is a substitution of the amino acid glycine with valine at position 75 of the spike protein. This mutation may affect the virus's ability to bind to its receptor on the surface of host cells.\n\nThe T76I mutation is a substitution of the amino acid threonine with isoleucine at position 76 of the spike protein. This mutation may also affect the virus's ability to bind to its receptor.\n\nThe Δ246-252 mutation is a deletion of a stretch of 7 amino acids (positions 246-252) in the spike protein. This mutation may affect the virus's ability to evade the host's immune system.\n\nThe L452Q mutation is a substitution of the amino acid leucine with glutamine at position 452 of the spike protein. This mutation may affect the virus's ability to infect cells.\n\nThe F490S mutation is a substitution of the amino acid phenylalanine with serine at position 490 of the spike protein. This mutation may affect the virus's ability to bind to its receptor.\n\nThe D614G mutation is a substitution of the amino acid aspartic acid with glycine at position 614 of the spike protein. This mutation is known to affect the virus's ability to infect cells and is found in many strains of the virus.\n\nThe T859N mutation is a substitution of the amino acid threonine with asparagine at position 859 of the spike protein. This mutation may affect the virus's ability to evade the host's immune system.\n\n**History**\nThe first samples of the Lambda variant were detected in Peru in August 2020. By April 2021, over 80% of new cases of COVID-19 in Peru were from the new variant. In mid-June 2021, 90.6% of new COVID-19 cases in Arequipa and 78.1% of new cases in Cusco were the Lambda variant, according to the Peruvian Ministry of Health.\n\nThe Lambda variant had also spread throughout South America and was detected in 29 countries, especially in Argentina, Chile, and Ecuador. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the Lambda variant as a \"variant of interest\" on June 14, 2021.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nAs of mid-June 2021, the Lambda variant was responsible for a significant proportion of new COVID-19 cases in many countries. The exact number of cases and the percentage of cases attributed to the Lambda variant varied by country and region.\n\nIn Peru, the Lambda variant was responsible for 90.6% of new COVID-19 cases in Arequipa and 78.1% of new cases in Cusco.\n\nIn Argentina, the Lambda variant was responsible for 60.1% of new COVID-19 cases in Buenos Aires and 44.1% of new cases in Córdoba.\n\nIn Chile, the Lambda variant was responsible for 51.6% of new COVID-19 cases in Santiago and 37.4% of new cases in Concepción.\n\nIn Ecuador, the Lambda variant was responsible for 40.9% of new COVID-19 cases in Quito and 30.4% of new cases in Guayaquil.\n\n**See also**\n\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* SARS-CoV-2\n* SARS-CoV-2 variants\n* World Health Organization\n* Peruvian Ministry of Health\n* Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) [10] He is also credited with having expanded the ANC's Zulu support base in Natal [26] At the ANC's July 1991 elective conference, Zuma stood for the post of ANC Secretary-General and lost to Cyril Ramaphosa, but was elected Deputy Secretary-General, comfortably beating Alfred Nzo and Popo Molefe in a vote [27]\n\n\nRise to the presidency\nZuma was elected deputy president of the ANC at the party's 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in December 1997, and was subsequently appointed deputy president of South Africa in June 1999, pursuant to the 1999 general election [20] Zuma served under newly elected President Mbeki and was the chief mediator in the Burundi peace process, [31] in which he worked with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who chaired the Great Lakes Regional Initiative, a grouping of regional presidents overseeing the peace process in Burundi [32]\n\n\nDeputy presidency\nZuma was elected deputy president of the ANC at the party's 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in December 1997, and was subsequently appointed deputy president of South Africa in June 1999, pursuant to the 1999 general election [20] Zuma served under newly elected President Mbeki and was the chief mediator in the Burundi peace process, [31] in which he worked with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who chaired the Great Lakes Regional Initiative, a grouping of regional presidents overseeing the peace process in Burundi [32]\n\n\nFirst corruption indictment\nSoon after Zuma's dismissal, the NPA announced its intention to instate formal corruption charges against him [40] He was served with a provisional indictment on fraud and corruption charges in November 2005, mirroring the indictment earlier served on Shaik [41] However, the NPA was unprepared to serve the final indictment and filed an application for postponement On 20 September 2006, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed the application, and when the NPA indicated that it was not prepared to proceed with the trial, the matter was stricken off [42]\n\n\nRape trial\nIn December 2005, Zuma was charged with raping a 31-year-old woman, known to the public by the pseudonym Khwezi [43] The incident allegedly occurred on 2 November 2005 at Zuma's home in Forest Town, Johannesburg [44] When the trial began on 6 March 2006, Zuma pleaded not guilty, claiming that he and Khwezi had consensual sex [44] He was acquitted on 8 May 2006 following a highly publicised trial [45] Zuma's admission was controversial, as he stated that he had not used a condom while having sex with Khwezi, despite knowing she was HIV-positive and having been, as deputy president, the head of the National AIDS Council and Moral Regeneration Campaign He told the court that he had taken a shower after the act, claiming that doing so reduced the risk of HIV transmission [46] The South African comic strip Madam & Eve, and political cartoonist Zapiro, repeatedly lampooned Zuma for his testimony, and Zuma now always appears under a showerhead in Zapiro cartoons [47]\n\n\nContinued popularity\nAlthough Zuma had been fired as national deputy president, he retained the ANC deputy presidency, and internal factions began to coalesce around him and Mbeki Between 2005 and 2007, their rivalry deepened into what Susan Booysen called \"a brutal and all-consuming disagreement between two major ANC groupings\" [48] [49] [50] Although the corruption and rape allegations were considered politically damaging, [46] [51] Zuma continued to enjoy considerable support from left-wing elements of the ANC, especially the ANC Youth League under Fikile Mbalula, and from the ANC's partners in the Tripartite Alliance, the SACP, and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) [52] Blade Nzimande of the SACP and Zwelinzima Vavi of COSATU were among Zuma's chief organisers and most vocal supporters (though both recanted their support years later) [53] Vavi and Youth League leader Julius Malema later said that they were prepared to \"kill for Zuma\" [54] [55] Nzimande and his SACP comrade Gwede Mantashe warned that the corruption trial would endanger public stability if it went ahead, [54] although there were reports that support for Zuma had caused a rift within the SACP [56] [57] While Zuma's political strength was at least partly based on his relationships within intra-party politics and Mbeki's lack of popularity with the left wing, he also had a large Zulu support base, [50] and one analyst argued that his supporters' loyalty was partially rooted in a traditionalist Zulu loyalty [58]\n\n\nDefamation lawsuits\n\nBy early 2006 during the rape trial, Zuma and his supporters complained of a concerted media plot to discredit him and harm his political career [67] In March, he appointed a legal team, including former Conservative Party politician Jurg Prinsloo and advocate Wycliffe Mothuloe, to fight his \"crucifixion by the media\" [44] [67] Among his targets was the Sowetan, whom he told that the media, at the instruction of Ngcuka of the NPA and former Justice Minister Penuell Maduna, was trying to \"crucify\" him The newspaper had printed the interview under the headline \"I'm like Christ – Zuma\" [67] In June and July 2006, Zuma filed a series of defamation lawsuits against various South African media outlets for publishing content that allegedly besmirched his public profile in the form of cartoons, commentary, photos and parody pieces The defendants included the Star (sued for R20 million), Rapport (R10 million), Highveld Stereo (R7 million), the Sunday Times (R6 million), the Citizen (R5 million), the Sunday Sun (R5 million), the Sunday Independent (R5 million), and the Sunday World (R5 million) [68] [69] Zuma said in 2005:\n\nElection as ANC president\nAs per party tradition, Zuma was in line to succeed Mbeki as head of the party However, by April 2007 [50] [73] [74] it was clear that Mbeki intended to run for a third term as ANC president Even though he was prohibited by the Constitution from standing again for the national presidency, the ANC lacks internal term limits Zuma gained the support of five of the nine provincial ANC branches when they nominated candidates at their provincial congresses in late 2007 [53] [75] [76] He became the favourite to win the presidency and became the ANC's presidential candidate in the 2009 elections While the ANC was extremely likely to win regardless of its candidate, there were reports that Zuma's support base and left-wing alliances unnerved international and domestic investors [77] [78] [79]\n\n\nSecond corruption indictment\nJust over a week after the Polokwane conference, the NPA reinstated charges against Zuma and served him an indictment to stand trial on 12 fraud charges, two corruption charges, and one charge each of racketeering and money laundering [81] [82] According to the Constitution, he would have been rendered ineligible for the national presidency had he been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment However, on 12 September 2008, the charges were declared unlawful on a technicality The presiding judge also expressed a belief that the charges had been the result of a political conspiracy against Zuma [83]\n\n\nRelease of Shaik on parole\nIn March 2009, Shaik was controversially released from prison on medical parole, just over two years into his 15-year sentence Earlier the same week, Zuma had said publicly that as national president he would pardon Shaik on medical grounds, and denied having played any role in Shaik's release [87] Shaik had applied for a presidential pardon in April 2008 when Mbeki was president, and he continued to lobby for a pardon during Zuma's presidency, saying it was unfair that he had been convicted while neither Zuma nor the implicated arms company had been taken to trial [88] [89]\n\n\nPresident of South Africa (2009–2018)\nThe ANC won the national election on 22 April 2009 by a slightly diminished majority of 65.90%, with Zuma having campaigned under the theme \"Continuity and Change\" [90] [91] His appointment was formalised by Parliament on 6 May, and he was sworn in as president of South Africa on 9 May 2009 [84]\n\n\nFailure to disclose assets\nAs president and therefore a member of cabinet, Zuma was required by the government's ethics code to declare his financial interests within 60 days of taking office In March 2010, nine months after taking office, South African media reported that he had failed to do so Opposition parties and the ANC's Tripartite Alliance partner COSATU urged Zuma to disclose his interests, and the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called for an investigation by the Public Protector [92] ANC spokesperson Brian Sokutu explained that Zuma constituted a \"special case\" because of his \"large family\", which complicated the process [93] The ANC distanced itself from Sokutu's statement [93] and Zuma filed the disclosure later that week [94]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nAs a former member of the SACP, Zuma has described himself as a socialist [79] and became president with the support of a left-wing coalition [79] [95] Analysts have claimed that he has bolstered populism in South Africa [96] [97] From 2017, at the tail-end of his presidency, his rhetoric and policy priorities became more leftist under what is known as the \"radical economic transformation\" (RET) programme of the ANC of this period Zuma announced the new focus on RET during his February 2017 State of the Nation address [98] Later that year, he explained that RET had been adopted as ANC policy and therefore as government policy, and defined it as a \"fundamental change in the structures, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership and control of the economy, in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor\" [99] The RET policy was controversial, [100] and some critics claimed that it had popular political appeal but lacked substance [101] [102] Others claimed that it was used to defend \"rent-seeking practices\" [103] and the influence of the Gupta family on Zuma's administration [104] [105] Zuma claimed that critics of his politics were agents of \"white monopoly capital\" [102]\n\n\nRadical economic transformation\nAs a former member of the SACP, Zuma has described himself as a socialist [79] and became president with the support of a left-wing coalition [79] [95] Analysts have claimed that he has bolstered populism in South Africa [96] [97] From 2017, at the tail-end of his presidency, his rhetoric and policy

that it had popular political appeal but lacked substance [101] [102] Others claimed that it was used to defend \"rent-seeking practices\" [103] and the influence of the Gupta family on Zuma's administration [104] [105] Zuma claimed that critics of his politics were agents of \"white monopoly capital\" [102]\n\n\nEconomic reform and spending\nZuma was inaugurated in South Africa at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis and amid South Africa's first recession since the end of apartheid [106] Upon taking office, he established the National Planning Commission under the office of the presidency which was chaired by Minister Trevor Manuel It was responsible for developing the National Development Plan, which was adopted by Zuma's cabinet in 2012 [107] [108] Other major initiatives included the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme, which was launched in 2011 amid electricity generation shortfalls at state energy utility Eskom, and a R4-trillion National Infrastructure Plan launched in 2012 [109] [110] [111] Zuma expressed support for expanding South Africa's nuclear power programme, particularly for a nuclear deal with Russian nuclear agency Rosatom which concluded in September 2014 but was ruled unlawful by the Western Cape High Court in 2017 [112] [113]\n\n\nForeign policy\n\nZuma's first state visit as president was to Angola, where he sought to improve relations with the government of President José Eduardo dos Santos, who had had a tense relationship with Mbeki [90] [132] His government's foreign policy emphasised the developmental objectives of African and Global South countries [90] with a focus on economic diplomacy [90] [132] [133] It was also characterised by a pivot towards the BRIC, especially China [106] [134] [135] In December 2010, South Africa became a formal member of BRIC, which was then renamed BRICS, [136] and Zuma attended the group's third summit meeting in Sanya, China, in 2011 South Africa's admission followed a concerted campaign for membership and has been described as \"a huge diplomatic coup\" and \"the most important foreign policy achievement of the Zuma administration\" [132]\n\nZimbabwe\n\nIn Zimbabwe, Mbeki had advocated for non-confrontational \"quiet diplomacy\" as an alternative to the \"megaphone diplomacy\" used by Western governments that harshly criticised Robert Mugabe's regime [141] This approach was controversial, with elements of the ruling alliance calling for a tougher stance against Mugabe and the ruling ZANU–PF [142] [143] [144] In a 2006 interview with Der Spiegel, Zuma had supported quiet diplomacy and said of Mugabe:\n\nInternational Criminal Court\nSouth Africa hosted the 25th Summit of the AU in Johannesburg from 7 to 15 June 2015 It was attended by Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, then a fugitive from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which sought to prosecute him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity South Africa was a signatory to the Rome Statute, which obliged it to arrest al-Bashir, but instead granted him diplomatic immunity while he attended the summit [157] While the matter was being adjudicated by a South African High Court, and just after Judge President Dunstan Mlambo ordered al-Bashir's arrest, the state's lawyer told the court that he had left the country [157] His plane left from Waterkloof Air Force Base, presumably with the government's knowledge [132] [158] and reportedly with Zuma's explicit approval [159] When it was criticised for this breach, the South African government argued that the ICC was used unfairly against African heads of state while failing to hold Western leaders to the same standards [134] [160] In 2016, it announced in New York that it was withdrawing from the ICC, [161] and Zuma's administration subsequently tabled legislation to effect the withdrawal [162]\n\n\nMandela's memorial\nIn a press conference on 5 December 2013, Zuma announced the death of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president [163] [164] The memorial took place on 10 December 2013 at FNB Stadium near Soweto When Zuma entered the stadium parts of the crowd booed him loudly [165] [166] Ramaphosa and Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for discipline, [167] [168] with Ramaphosa telling the crowd in Zulu that the country could address its internal disagreements when foreign dignitaries were not present [169] Some South African commentators said that the crowd's actions were unexpected, [167] [169] and they were widely linked to the ongoing Nkandla scandal, [167] [170] [171] a draft of the Public Protector's provisional report had been leaked the previous week, or to dissatisfaction with Zuma's administration more generally [172] Others suggested that the booing reflected frustration with the lack of socioeconomic change under the ANC government since Mandela's presidency, [170] or that it reflected enduring divisions within the ANC; the crowd also chanted Mbeki's name [169] In a public statement, the ANC chastised those who had booed, saying they had embarrassed the country [168] The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) was criticised for having cut away from the booing in its live broadcast of the memorial [173]\n\n\nRe-election\nDespite an \"Anyone but Zuma\" campaign in the run-up to the ANC's 53rd National Conference, [174] [175] Zuma was re-elected ANC president on 18 December 2012, beating Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe by a large margin [176] Although in 2008 he had said that he would prefer to serve only one term as president, [177] Zuma became the ANC's sole presidential candidate in the 2014 national election In January 2014, after he was heckled at Mandela's memorial, the Sunday Tribune reported that around November 2013, KwaZulu-Natal branches of the ANC had discussed a proposed resolution asking Zuma not to run for a second term as the country's president [178] However, ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte dismissed rumours of disunity in the ANC saying, \"The policy is that the president of the ANC is always the candidate for the election We don't have another candidate and there will be no other candidate.\" [179]\n\n\nNkandla homestead\nZuma began his second term amid ongoing controversy over what were officially security upgrades made with state funds to his private homestead at Nkandla Public Protector Thuli Madonsela investigated, and in late November 2013 her draft report was leaked to the Mail & Guardian [181] Similar to the final version of the report, titled \"Secure in Comfort\" and released on 19 March 2014, [182] the draft found that some of the Nkandla upgrades exceeded Zuma's security needs and recommended that Zuma should repay the state [181] The opposition, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and DA applied for legal recourse to compel Zuma to follow the recommendations in Madonsela's report, and the Constitutional Court found in their favour on 31 March 2016 In EFF v Speaker; DA v Speaker, the full court agreed that Madonsela's report was binding, meaning Zuma was required to repay the state for some of the Nkandla upgrades and that Zuma had failed to uphold the country's Constitution [183] In a public address on 1 April, Zuma welcomed the judgment and apologised to the country, [184] though legal academic Pierre de Vos said that the statement seriously misconstrued the judgment [185] [186]\n\n\nState capture allegations\nZuma's close and allegedly corrupt relationship with the Gupta family, known ANC donors, [205] became a major source of discontent both within the ANC [206] and among the South African public [207] [208] [209] This relationship received widespread public attention in April 2013 when the media reported that the Guptas had landed an Airbus A330 at Waterkloof Air Force Base without formal authorisation, but was welcomed by a police escort [210] [211] The political influence of the Guptas was one issue that was thought to have motivated a wave of anti-government protests in October 2015, [207] and at Zuma's February 2016 State of the Nation address, the EFF coined the phrase \"Zupta\", a portmanteau of \"Zuma\" and \"Gupta\", when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting \"Zupta must fall.\" [212] [213]\n\n\nCabinet reshuffles\nZuma was criticised for a lack of stability in his cabinet During his two terms in office, he implemented twelve cabinet reshuffles, and some of his appointments unsettled financial markets, [106] [223] [224] such as when Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was replacedwith the little-known backbencher Des van Rooyen in the 9 December 2015 reshuffle [225] The political response was so hostile that van Rooyen was replaced by Pravin Gordhan after four days in office [226] [227] Later, on 31 March 2017, Gordhan was sacked and replaced by Malusi Gigaba Gordhan's deputy Jonas, who had alleged corruption by the Guptas a year earlier, was also fired [228] The reshuffle was criticised by senior ANC leaders including Deputy President Ramaphosa, [229] from the SACP, [230] and from members of the public, who, on 7 April, launched protests against Zuma and his government in several of South Africa's major cities [231] Another march on the Union Buildings on 12 April, Zuma's birthday, was organised by a coalition of seven opposition parties It attracted tens of thousands of protesters and the Mail & Guardian said that it was \"possibly the largest march in post-apartheid history\" [231] [232]\n\n\nSuccession\nFrom 2015, Zuma was understood to favour his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as ANC president and therefore, presumptively, as national president His critics claimed that he would use his relationship with Dlamini-Zuma to retain control of the ANC and the state, and avoid prosecution on corruption charges [233] [234] [235] She campaigned on a platform of economic transformation – so that the pro-Dlamini-Zuma faction became known as the RET faction – while her challenger, Ramaphosa, emphasised anti-corruption [236] [237] On 18 December 2017, at the ANC's 54th National Conference, Ramaphosa narrowly beat Dlamini-Zuma in a vote and succeeded Zuma as ANC president [238]\n\n\nSuccession as ANC president\nFrom 2015, Zuma was understood to favour his

vote and succeeded Zuma as ANC president [238]\n\n\nResignation\n\nOnce Ramaphosa replaced Zuma as ANC president, there was growing pressure for the latter to resign from the national presidency On 6 February 2018, Zuma's annual State of the Nation Address, scheduled for 8 February, was postponed indefinitely \"to create room for establishing a much more conducive political atmosphere\" [239] The following week, Ramaphosa and Zuma spent almost five days in talks On 12 December, when it became clear that the negotiations had failed, the ANC National Executive Committee convened an emergency meeting near Pretoria, and, after nearly ten hours of debate, decided that Zuma should be \"recalled\" by the party if he did not resign voluntarily Ramaphosa and another senior official reportedly drove to Zuma's home just after midnight to deliver the ultimatum, but Zuma refused, insisting on a three-month notice period or transition period before leaving office [240] On 13 December, the National Executive Committee publicly announced its intention to recall Zuma [241] As a party-political body, it formally lacked the authority to remove sitting presidents, though it could instruct the ANC caucus, which controlled Parliament, to remove Zuma through a motion of no confidence if he did not resign at its request [242]\n\nPost-presidency\nThe week after his resignation, Zuma attended a farewell cocktail party in his honour, hosted by Ramaphosa at Tuynhuys in Cape Town and attended by other members of cabinet [250] Although former presidents are invited to all State of the Nation addresses, Zuma did not attend Ramaphosa's addresses in 2018, 2019, or 2020 [251]\n\n\nThird corruption indictment\nOn 16 March 2018, a month after Zuma resigned from the presidency, the NPA announced that he would again face prosecution on the same 16 criminal charges he was indicted on in 2006: 12 charges of fraud, two of corruption, and one each of racketeering and money laundering, all related to the 1999 Arms Deal and to Zuma's relationship with Shaik [252] The case was enrolled in the Pietermaritzburg High Court Zuma pleaded not guilty when the trial began on 26 May 2021 [253] As of May 2024, the trial was scheduled to resume in late April 2025 after many appeals by Zuma [254]\n\n\nZondo Commission\nAt the instruction of the Public Protector and high court, in January 2018 Zuma established the Zondo Commission to investigate fraud, corruption, and state capture in the public sector in South Africa Zuma was scheduled to testify before the commission for five days in mid-July 2019, and on Monday 15 July he opened his testimony by claiming that the commission was part of a decades-long \"character assassination\" [255] conspiracy against him [256] [257] He denied the veracity of several other witnesses' testimony and questioned the appropriateness of the phrase \"state capture\", which he said was used to discredit him If the whole state had truly been captured, he argued that the commission should investigate the judiciary and Parliament as well as the executive branch of government [258] After the hearings, Zuma addressed supporters who gathered outside the commission's offices in Johannesburg [255] [259]\n\n\nTestimony\nAt the instruction of the Public Protector and high court, in January 2018 Zuma established the Zondo Commission to

investigate the judiciary and Parliament as well as the executive branch of government [258] After the hearings, Zuma addressed supporters who gathered outside the commission's offices in Johannesburg [255] [259]\n\n\nContempt of court\nIn early December, the commission issued summonses for Zuma to appear before it in the weeks of 18 January and 15 February 2021 and applied to the Constitutional Court for an order compelling Zuma to comply with the summonses, [267] which was granted on 28 January [268] [269] When Zuma did not comply with the February summons, in open defiance of the court order, the commission approached the Constitutional Court and asked it to sentence Zuma to two years' imprisonment for contempt of court [270] Zuma refused to participate in the contempt proceedings, although he complained of bias, and on 29 June 2021 he was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment [271]\n\n\nArrest and imprisonment\n\nZuma was given until 4 July to hand himself in, after which the police would have until 7 July to arrest him forcibly [272] The uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans' Association warned that his arrest would destabilise the country, [273] and hundreds of supporters gathered outside his Nkandla residence, threatening violence if he was detained [272] [274] Zuma told the press that he had been sentenced without trial, saying that it might \"remind our people of the apartheid days\", and told a rally in Nkandla:\n\nuMkhonto we Sizwe political party\nIn December 2023, Zuma announced that, while planning to remain a lifelong member of the ANC, he would not be campaigning for the ANC in the 2024 South African general election, and would instead be voting for a newly-formed party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) [293] He stated that \"I cannot and will not\" campaign for the ANC of current president Cyril Ramaphosa, Zuma's successor, and that to do so would be a 'betrayal' [294] [295] On 29 January 2024, Zuma was suspended from the ANC for his endorsement of the MK Party [296] The ANC approached South Africa's electoral court and contended that Zuma's registration of the MK Party was \"unlawful\" (as it was a name of the ANC'smilitary wing) and also took on the country's Electoral Commission for allowing its registration [297] Lawyers for the MK Party told the court that the ANC knew about the existence of the party since its registration in September 2023 but wondered why they waited this long for Zuma to endorse it before challenging it [298] Judges for the electoral court then dismissed the ANC's request and found that the MK Party's registration was lawful [299]\n\n\nPersonality and public image\nZuma's \"charisma and affable personality\" [305] is at the centre of his public image, and is thought to be responsible for much of his political popularity [306] [307] [308] His charisma is most fully on display at his political rallies, which sociologist Roger Southall describes as laden with \"political theatre\" and \"popular idiom\", [309] especially through song – his longstanding trademark is uMkhonto we Sizwe anthem \"Umshini wami\" (English: Bring Me My Machine Gun), but he also became associated with \"Yinde lendlela\" (English: It's a Long Journey) after the ANC's Mangaung conference in 2012 [310] [311] [312] Journalist Alec Russell wrote in 2009, \"When Zuma gets in front of these crowds, he is more than a politician: briefly, he becomes something closer to a revivalist preacher, or the leader of a cult.\" [313]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 2010, Zuma's bodyguards were implicated in multiple incidents involving members of the public and journalists.\n\n\nAlleged abuses by bodyguards\nIn 2010, Zuma's bodyguards were implicated in multiple incidents involving members of the public and journalists.\n\n\n\"Shoot the Boer\" song\nIn January 2012, Zuma gave a speech at the ANC Centennial 2012 celebrations in Bloemfontein and, afterwards, sang the controversial song \"Dubul' ibhunu\" (\"Shoot the Boer\") [348] [349]\n\n\n\"The Spear\" painting\nIn 2012, Zuma was featured in a satirical painting by Cape Town-based artist Brett Murray, who depicted him in his painting The Spear, with his genitals exposed The ANC responded by threatening court action against the gallery showing the painting, and further demanding that the image should be removed from online sources [350] [351] On 22 May 2012, the painting was vandalised while it was hanging in an art gallery in Johannesburg Zuma's face and genitals were painted over [352]\n\n\nPanama Papers revelations\nClive Khulubuse Zuma, Jacob Zuma's nephew, was named in the Panama Papers [353] as a result of his links to oilfields in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Shortly after Jacob Zuma met with DRC president Joseph Kabila, Khulubuse Zuma's company Caprikat Limited secured a 100-billion-rand oil deal in the DRC [354] [234] [355]\n\n\nJacob Zuma Foundation\nZuma started the foundation to send children to school and build houses for people living in poverty The former chairperson of the foundation is Dudu Myeni, [356] before she resigned from her memberships on the boards of directors of these and other bodies because she was declared a delinquent director for life in May 2020 by the Pretoria High Court [357]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nZuma is a polygamist, in line with traditional Zulu culture, and has been married six times In 2012 the Daily Telegraph estimated he had 20 children, [358] and in 2014 the Guardian reported he has 21, [359] some of whom were born out of wedlock In an interview, he said:\n\nPolygamy\n\nZuma is a polygamist, in line with traditional Zulu culture, and has been married six times In 2012 the Daily Telegraph estimated he had 20 children, [358] and in 2014 the Guardian reported he has 21, [359] some of whom were born out of wedlock In an interview, he said:\n\nWives and children\nZuma has also been engaged to other women, including, from 2002, Princess Sebentile Dlamini, a niece of Swazi King Mswati III Zuma paid the traditional lobola in cattle, [364] [380] but, as of 2022, they have not married, although the Citizen reported in 2017 that they were still engaged [381] He was also engaged to Nonkanyiso Conco (born 16 October 1993), [382] [383] a cast member on Real Housewives of Durban, but has broken off the engagement and are reportedly estranged [368] They have a child together: Sakh'muzi (born 12 April 2018) [384] [385]\n\n\n2009 \"love-child\"\nIn January 2010, the Sunday Times reported that Khoza had given birth to Zuma's daughter in 2009, [390] [391] and Zuma ultimately confirmed that he had paid inhlawulo, acknowledging paternity, and appealed for privacy [392] Opposition parties criticised Zuma's actions Both the African Christian Democratic Party and the DA said that it undermined the government's HIV/AIDS prevention programme, which promoted safe sex and marital fidelity [393] DA leader Zille also argued that it was not a purely private matter, since elected public officials had to embody the principles and values for which they stood [394] The Congress of the People said that Zuma could no longer use African cultural practices to justify his \"promiscuity\", [393] and Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille said that Zuma was asking people \"to do as I say and not as I do\"

He is a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and has been involved in politics since the 1950s.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nZuma was born in Nkandla, Natal Province (now part of the province of KwaZulu-Natal), on April 12, 1942. He was the son of Nobhekisisa, a policeman, and Geinamazwi, a domestic worker. Zuma's middle name, Gedleyihlekisa, means \"one who smiles while causing you harm\" in Zulu. He did not receive formal schooling and began engaging in anti-apartheid politics at an early age.\n\n**Anti-Apartheid Activism**\n\nZuma joined the ANC in 1959 and became an active member of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's military wing, in 1962. He was arrested with a group of 45 recruits near Zeerust in western Transvaal (now part of the North West Province) and was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the apartheid government. Zuma was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which he served on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela and other notable ANC leaders.\n\n**Imprisonment and Exile**\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Zuma became a referee for prisoners association football games, organized by the prisoners own governing body, Makana F.A. After his release from prison, Zuma returned to South Africa in 1980 and was involved in the negotiations process. He became a key figure in the ANC's strategy to dismantle apartheid and bring about democracy in South Africa.\n\n**Rise to the Presidency**\n\nZuma was elected deputy president of the ANC at the party's 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in December 1997. He was subsequently appointed deputy president of South Africa in June 1999, following the 1999 general election. Zuma served under President Thabo Mbeki and was the chief mediator in the Burundi peace process.\n\n**First Corruption Indictment**\n\nIn 2006, Zuma was served with a provisional indictment on fraud and corruption charges, which were later dropped due to a technicality. However, the charges were reinstated in 2007 and were eventually dropped again in 2009.\n\n**President of South Africa (2009-2018)**\n\nThe ANC won the national election on April 22, 2009, and Zuma was inaugurated as President of South Africa on May 9, 2009. During his presidency, Zuma implemented several major initiatives, including the National Planning Commission and the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme. He also established the Zondo Commission to investigate state capture and corruption in the public sector.\n\n**Cabinet Reshuffles**\n\nZuma was criticized for his lack of stability in his cabinet, with 12 cabinet reshuffles during his presidency. The reshuffles were often met with hostility from the public and the ANC, with some of his appointments being seen as an attempt to consolidate his power.\n\n**Succession**\n\nFrom 2015, Zuma was seen as favoring his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as ANC president and therefore, presumptively, as national president. However, his critics claimed that he would use his relationship with Dlamini-Zuma to retain control of the ANC and the state.\n\n**Resignation**\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Zuma's annual State of the Nation Address was postponed indefinitely, and he was recalled by the ANC on February 13, 2018. Zuma refused to resign voluntarily and instead, demanded a three-month notice period or transition period before leaving office.\n\n**Post-Presidency**\n\nAfter his resignation, Zuma attended a farewell cocktail party in his honor, hosted by President Cyril Ramaphosa. However, Zuma did not attend Ramaphosa's State of the Nation addresses in 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n\n**Third Corruption Indictment**\n\nIn 2018, Zuma was again indicted on 16 criminal charges, related to the 1999 Arms Deal and his relationship with Schabir Shaik. The trial began in 2021, and as of 2024, the trial is scheduled to resume in late April 2025.\n\n**Zondo Commission**\n\nAt the instruction of the Public Protector and high court, Zuma established the Zondo Commission to investigate state capture and corruption in the public sector. Zuma was scheduled to testify before the commission in 2019, but his testimony was delayed due to his health issues.\n\n**Contempt of Court**\n\nIn 2021, the commission issued summonses for Zuma to appear before it, but he refused to comply with the summons. The commission approached the Constitutional Court, which granted an order compelling Zuma to comply with the summons. However, Zuma refused to participate in the contempt proceedings, and on June 29, 2021, he was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.\n\n**Arrest and Imprisonment**\n\nZuma was given until July 4, 2021, to hand himself in, but he failed to do so. The police arrested him on July 7, 2021, and he was taken into custody. Zuma claimed that he was being treated unfairly and that his arrest was a reminder of the apartheid era.\n\n**Personality and Public Image**\n\nZuma's charisma and affable personality are central to his public image, and are thought to be responsible for much of his political popularity. His rallies are often characterized by \"political theatre\" and \"popular idiom,\" and he is known for his ability to connect with his audience.\n\n**Honors and Awards**\n\nZuma has received several honors and awards, including:\n\n* Honorary degrees from the University of Durban-Westville and the University of Fort Hare\n* The Order of the Companions of O.R. Tambo\n* The Order of Mapungubwe (Gold)\n* The Order of Ikhamanga (Gold)\n\n**Filmography**\n\nZuma has appeared in several films and documentaries, including:\n\n* \"Comrade Jacob Zuma\" (2009)\n* \"The President\" (2010)\n* \"Zuma: The President\" (2011)\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Jacob Zuma: A Biography\" by Dale T. McKinley (2008)\n* \"The Presidency of Jacob Zuma\" by Thomas Lodge (2013)\n* \"Zuma: A Biography\" by Irvin Jim (2015)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official Website of Jacob Zuma\n* Wikipedia Article

outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nZuma was born in Nkandla, Natal Province (now part of the province of KwaZulu-Natal), [7]: 1  and often moved around Natal and the suburbs of Durban as a child [8] His father, Nobhekisisa, was a policeman who died when Zuma was five, [9] and his mother, Geinamazwi, was a domestic worker [7]: 4  [10] His middle name, Gedleyihlekisa, means \"one who smiles while causing you harm\" in Zulu [11] He did not receive formal schooling [12]\n\n\nAnti-apartheid activism\nZuma began engaging in anti-apartheid politics at an early age and joined the ANC in 1959 He became an active member of uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1962, two years after the ANC was banned [19] That year, he was arrested with a group of 45 recruits near Zeerust in western Transvaal, currently part of the North West Province [20] Zuma was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the apartheid government and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which he served on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela and other notable ANC leaders also imprisoned during that time [20] While imprisoned, Zuma was a referee for prisoners association football games, organised by the prisoners own governing body, Makana F.A [21]\n\n\nImprisonment and exile\nZuma began engaging in anti-apartheid politics at an early age and joined the ANC in 1959 He became an active member of uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1962, two years after the ANC was banned [19] That year, he was arrested with a group of 45 recruits near Zeerust in western Transvaal, currently part of the North West Province [20] Zuma was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the apartheid government and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which he served on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela and other notable ANC leaders also imprisoned during that time [20] While imprisoned, Zuma was a referee for prisoners association football games, organised by the prisoners own governing body, Makana F.A [21]\n\n\nReturn from exile\nAfter the ANC was unbanned in February 1990, Zuma returned to South Africa on 21 March [10] to begin the negotiations process [22] He was one of the first ANC leaders to return to South Africa for negotiations [10] Later that year, he was elected unopposed as the ANC's Southern Natal Chairperson Zuma, as a Zulu, became known as a leading peace broker in Natal during the political violence of this period that was concentrated in that province, and arose largely from conflict between nationalist supporters of the then Xhosa-dominated ANC and supporters of the Zulu nationalist [25] Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) [10] He is also credited with having expanded the ANC's Zulu support base in Natal [26] At the ANC's July 1991 elective conference, Zuma stood for the post of ANC Secretary-General and lost to Cyril Ramaphosa, but was elected Deputy Secretary-General, comfortably beating Alfred Nzo and Popo Molefe in a vote [27]\n\n\nRise to the presidency\nZuma was elected deputy president of the ANC at the party's 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in December 1997, and was subsequently appointed deputy president of South Africa in June 1999, pursuant to the 1999 general election [20] Zuma served under newly elected President Mbeki and was the chief mediator in the Burundi peace process, [31] in which he worked with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who chaired the Great Lakes Regional Initiative, a grouping of regional presidents overseeing the peace process in Burundi [32]\n\n\nDeputy presidency\nZuma was elected deputy president of the ANC at the party's 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in December 1997, and was subsequently appointed deputy president of South Africa in June 1999, pursuant to the 1999 general election [20] Zuma served under newly elected President Mbeki and was the chief mediator in the Burundi peace process, [31] in which he worked with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who chaired the Great Lakes Regional Initiative, a grouping of regional presidents overseeing the peace process in Burundi [32]\n\n\nFirst corruption indictment\nSoon after Zuma's dismissal, the NPA announced its intention to instate formal corruption charges against him [40] He was served with a provisional indictment on fraud and corruption charges in November 2005, mirroring the indictment earlier served on Shaik [41] However, the NPA was unprepared to serve the final indictment and filed an application for postponement On 20 September 2006, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed the application, and when the NPA indicated that it was not prepared to proceed with the trial, the matter was stricken off [42]\n\n\nRape trial\nIn December 2005, Zuma was charged with raping a 31-year-old woman, known to the public by the pseudonym Khwezi [43] The incident allegedly occurred on 2 November 2005 at Zuma's home in Forest Town, Johannesburg [44] When the trial began on 6 March 2006, Zuma pleaded not guilty, claiming that he and Khwezi had consensual sex [44] He was acquitted on 8 May 2006 following a highly publicised trial [45] Zuma's admission was controversial, as he stated that he had not used a condom while having sex with Khwezi, despite knowing she was HIV-positive and having been, as deputy president, the head of the National AIDS Council and Moral Regeneration Campaign He told the court that he had taken a shower after the act, claiming that doing so reduced the risk of HIV transmission [46] The South African comic strip Madam & Eve, and political cartoonist Zapiro, repeatedly lampooned Zuma for his testimony, and Zuma now always appears under a showerhead in Zapiro cartoons [47]\n\n\nContinued popularity\nAlthough Zuma had been fired as national deputy president, he retained the ANC deputy presidency, and internal factions began to coalesce around him and Mbeki Between 2005 and 2007, their rivalry deepened into what Susan Booysen called \"a brutal and all-consuming disagreement between two major ANC groupings\" [48] [49] [50] Although the corruption and rape allegations were considered politically damaging, [46] [51] Zuma continued to enjoy considerable support from left-wing elements of the ANC, especially the ANC Youth League under Fikile Mbalula, and from the ANC's partners in the Tripartite Alliance, the SACP, and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) [52] Blade Nzimande of the SACP and Zwelinzima Vavi of COSATU were among Zuma's chief organisers and most vocal supporters (though both recanted their support years later) [53] Vavi and Youth League leader Julius Malema later said that they were prepared to \"kill for Zuma\" [54] [55] Nzimande and his SACP comrade Gwede Mantashe warned that the corruption trial would endanger public stability if it went ahead, [54] although there were reports that support for Zuma had caused a rift within the SACP [56] [57] While Zuma's political strength was at least partly based on his relationships within intra-party politics and Mbeki's lack of popularity with the left wing, he also had a large Zulu support base, [50] and one analyst argued that his supporters' loyalty was partially rooted in a traditionalist Zulu loyalty [58]\n\n\nDefamation lawsuits\n\nBy early 2006 during the rape trial, Zuma and his supporters complained of a concerted media plot to discredit him and harm his political career [67] In March, he appointed a legal team, including former Conservative Party politician Jurg Prinsloo and advocate Wycliffe Mothuloe, to fight his \"crucifixion by the media\" [44] [67] Among his targets was the Sowetan, whom he told that the media, at the instruction of Ngcuka of the NPA and former Justice Minister Penuell Maduna, was trying to \"crucify\" him The newspaper had printed the interview under the headline \"I'm like Christ – Zuma\" [67] In June and July 2006, Zuma filed a series of defamation lawsuits against various South African media outlets for publishing content that allegedly besmirched his public profile in the form of cartoons, commentary, photos and parody pieces The defendants included the Star (sued for R20 million), Rapport (R10 million), Highveld Stereo (R7 million), the Sunday Times (R6 million), the Citizen (R5 million), the Sunday Sun (R5 million), the Sunday Independent (R5 million), and the Sunday World (R5 million) [68] [69] Zuma said in 2005:\n\nElection as ANC president\nAs per party tradition, Zuma was in line to succeed Mbeki as head of the party However, by April 2007 [50] [73] [74] it was clear that Mbeki intended to run for a third term as ANC president Even though he was prohibited by the Constitution from standing again for the national presidency, the ANC lacks internal term limits Zuma gained the support of five of the nine provincial ANC branches when they nominated candidates at their provincial congresses in late 2007 [53] [75] [76] He became the favourite to win the presidency and became the ANC's presidential candidate in the 2009 elections While the ANC was extremely likely to win regardless of its candidate, there were reports that Zuma's support base and left-wing alliances unnerved international and domestic investors [77] [78] [79]\n\n\nSecond corruption indictment\nJust over a week after the Polokwane conference, the NPA reinstated charges against Zuma and served him an indictment to stand trial on 12 fraud charges, two corruption charges, and one charge each of racketeering and money laundering [81] [82] According to the Constitution, he would have been rendered ineligible for the national presidency had he been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment However, on 12 September 2008, the charges were declared unlawful on a technicality The presiding judge also expressed a belief that the charges had been the result of a political conspiracy against Zuma [83]\n\n\nRelease of Shaik on parole\nIn March 2009, Shaik was controversially released from prison on medical parole, just over two years into his 15-year sentence Earlier the same week, Zuma had said publicly that as national president he would pardon Shaik on medical grounds, and denied having played any role in Shaik's release [87] Shaik had applied for a presidential pardon in April 2008 when Mbeki was president, and he continued to lobby for a pardon during Zuma's presidency, saying it was unfair that he had been convicted while neither Zuma nor the implicated arms company had been taken to trial [88] [89]\n\n\nPresident of South Africa (2009–2018)\nThe ANC won the national election on 22 April 2009 by a slightly diminished majority of 65.90%, with Zuma having campaigned under the theme \"Continuity and Change\" [90] [91] His appointment was formalised by Parliament on 6 May, and he was sworn in as president of South Africa on 9 May 2009 [84]\n\n\nFailure to disclose assets\nAs president and therefore a member of cabinet, Zuma was required by the government's ethics code to declare his financial interests within 60 days of taking office In March 2010, nine months after taking office, South African media reported that he had failed to do so Opposition parties and the ANC's Tripartite Alliance partner COSATU urged Zuma to disclose his interests, and the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called for an investigation by the Public Protector [92] ANC spokesperson Brian Sokutu explained that Zuma constituted a \"special case\" because of his \"large family\", which complicated the process [93] The ANC distanced itself from Sokutu's statement [93] and Zuma filed the disclosure later that week [94]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nAs a former member of the SACP, Zuma has described himself as a socialist [79] and became president with the support of a left-wing coalition [79] [95] Analysts have claimed that he has bolstered populism in South Africa [96] [97] From 2017, at the tail-end of his presidency, his rhetoric and policy priorities became more leftist under what is known as the \"radical economic transformation\" (RET) programme of the ANC of this period Zuma announced the new focus on RET during his February 2017 State of the Nation address [98] Later that year, he explained that RET had been adopted as ANC policy and therefore as government policy, and defined it as a \"fundamental change in the structures, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership and control of the economy, in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor\" [99] The RET policy was controversial, [100] and some critics claimed that it had popular political appeal but lacked substance [101] [102] Others claimed that it was used to defend \"rent-seeking practices\" [103] and the influence of the Gupta family on Zuma's administration [104] [105] Zuma claimed that critics of his politics were agents of \"white monopoly capital\" [102]\n\n\nRadical economic transformation\nAs a former member of the SACP, Zuma has described himself as a socialist [79] and became president with the support of a left-wing coalition [79] [95] Analysts have claimed that he has bolstered populism in South Africa [96] [97] From 2017, at the tail-end of his presidency, his rhetoric and policy priorities became more leftist under what is known as the \"radical economic transformation\" (RET) programme of the ANC of this period Zuma announced the new focus on RET during his February 2017 State of the Nation address [98] Later that year, he explained that RET had been adopted as ANC policy and therefore as government policy, and defined it as a \"fundamental change in the structures, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership and control of the economy, in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor\" [99] The RET policy was controversial, [100] and some critics claimed that it had popular political appeal but lacked substance [101] [102] Others claimed that it was used to defend \"rent-seeking practices\" [103] and the influence of the Gupta family on Zuma's administration [104] [105] Zuma claimed that critics of his politics were agents of \"white monopoly capital\" [102]\n\n\nEconomic reform and spending\nZuma was inaugurated in South Africa at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis and amid South Africa's first recession since the end of apartheid [106] Upon taking office, he established the National Planning Commission under the office of the presidency which was chaired by Minister Trevor Manuel It was responsible for developing the National Development Plan, which was adopted by Zuma's cabinet in 2012 [107] [108] Other major initiatives included the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme, which was launched in 2011 amid electricity generation shortfalls at state energy utility Eskom, and a R4-trillion National Infrastructure Plan launched in 2012 [109] [110] [111] Zuma expressed support for expanding South Africa's nuclear power programme, particularly for a nuclear deal with Russian nuclear agency Rosatom which concluded in September 2014 but was ruled unlawful by the Western Cape High Court in 2017 [112] [113]\n\n\nForeign policy\n\nZuma's first state visit as president was to Angola, where he sought to improve relations with the government of President José Eduardo dos Santos, who had had a tense relationship with Mbeki [90] [132] His government's foreign policy emphasised the developmental objectives of African and Global South countries [90] with a focus on economic diplomacy [90] [132] [133] It was also characterised by a pivot towards the BRIC, especially China [106] [134] [135] In December 2010, South Africa became a formal member of BRIC, which was then renamed BRICS, [136] and Zuma attended the group's third summit meeting in Sanya, China, in 2011 South Africa's admission followed a concerted campaign for membership and has been described as \"a huge diplomatic coup\" and \"the most important foreign policy achievement of the Zuma administration\" [132]\n\nZimbabwe\n\nIn Zimbabwe, Mbeki had advocated for non-confrontational \"quiet diplomacy\" as an alternative to the \"megaphone diplomacy\" used by Western governments that harshly criticised Robert Mugabe's regime [141] This approach was controversial, with elements of the ruling alliance calling for a tougher stance against Mugabe and the ruling ZANU–PF [142] [143] [144] In a 2006 interview with Der Spiegel, Zuma had supported quiet diplomacy and said of Mugabe:\n\nInternational Criminal Court\nSouth Africa hosted the 25th Summit of the AU in Johannesburg from 7 to 15 June 2015 It was attended by Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, then a fugitive from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which sought to prosecute him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity South Africa was a signatory to the Rome Statute, which obliged it to arrest al-Bashir, but instead granted him diplomatic immunity while he attended the summit [157] While the matter was being adjudicated by a South African High Court, and just after Judge President Dunstan Mlambo ordered al-Bashir's arrest, the state's lawyer told the court that he had left the country [157] His plane left from Waterkloof Air Force Base, presumably with the government's knowledge [132] [158] and reportedly with Zuma's explicit approval [159] When it was criticised for this breach, the South African government argued that the ICC was used unfairly against African heads of state while failing to hold Western leaders to the same standards [134] [160] In 2016, it announced in New York that it was withdrawing from the ICC, [161] and Zuma's administration subsequently tabled legislation to effect the withdrawal [162]\n\n\nMandela's memorial\nIn a press conference on 5 December 2013, Zuma announced the death of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president [163] [164] The memorial took place on 10 December 2013 at FNB Stadium near Soweto When Zuma entered the stadium parts of the crowd booed him loudly [165] [166] Ramaphosa and Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for discipline, [167] [168] with Ramaphosa telling the crowd in Zulu that the country could address its internal disagreements when foreign dignitaries were not present [169] Some South African commentators said that the crowd's actions were unexpected, [167] [169] and they were widely linked to the ongoing Nkandla scandal, [167] [170] [171] a draft of the Public Protector's provisional report had been leaked the previous week, or to dissatisfaction with Zuma's administration more generally [172] Others suggested that the booing reflected frustration with the lack of socioeconomic change under the ANC government since Mandela's presidency, [170] or that it reflected enduring divisions within the ANC; the crowd also chanted Mbeki's name [169] In a public statement, the ANC chastised those who had booed, saying they had embarrassed the country [168] The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) was criticised for having cut away from the booing in its live broadcast of the memorial [173]\n\n\nRe-election\nDespite an \"Anyone but Zuma\" campaign in the run-up to the ANC's 53rd National Conference, [174] [175] Zuma was re-elected ANC president on 18 December 2012, beating Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe by a large margin [176] Although in 2008 he had said that he would prefer to serve only one term as president, [177] Zuma became the ANC's sole presidential candidate in the 2014 national election In January 2014, after he was heckled at Mandela's memorial, the Sunday Tribune reported that around November 2013, KwaZulu-Natal branches of the ANC had discussed a proposed resolution asking Zuma not to run for a second term as the country's president [178] However, ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte dismissed rumours of disunity in the ANC saying, \"The policy is that the president of the ANC is always the candidate for the election We don't have another candidate and there will be no other candidate.\" [179]\n\n\nNkandla homestead\nZuma began his second term amid ongoing controversy over what were officially security upgrades made with state funds to his private homestead at Nkandla Public Protector Thuli Madonsela investigated, and in late November 2013 her draft report was leaked to the Mail & Guardian [181] Similar to the final version of the report, titled \"Secure in Comfort\" and released on 19 March 2014, [182] the draft found that some of the Nkandla upgrades exceeded Zuma's security needs and recommended that Zuma should repay the state [181] The opposition, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and DA applied for legal recourse to compel Zuma to follow the recommendations in Madonsela's report, and the Constitutional Court found in their favour on 31 March 2016 In EFF v Speaker; DA v Speaker, the full court agreed that Madonsela's report was binding, meaning Zuma was required to repay the state for some of the Nkandla upgrades and that Zuma had failed to uphold the country's Constitution [183] In a public address on 1 April, Zuma welcomed the judgment and apologised to the country, [184] though legal academic Pierre de Vos said that the statement seriously misconstrued the judgment [185] [186]\n\n\nState capture allegations\nZuma's close and allegedly corrupt relationship with the Gupta family, known ANC donors, [205] became a major source of discontent both within the ANC [206] and among the South African public [207] [208] [209] This relationship received widespread public attention in April 2013 when the media reported that the Guptas had landed an Airbus A330 at Waterkloof Air Force Base without formal authorisation, but was welcomed by a police escort [210] [211] The political influence of the Guptas was one issue that was thought to have motivated a wave of anti-government protests in October 2015, [207] and at Zuma's February 2016 State of the Nation address, the EFF coined the phrase \"Zupta\", a portmanteau of \"Zuma\" and \"Gupta\", when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting \"Zupta must fall.\" [212] [213]\n\n\nCabinet reshuffles\nZuma was criticised for a lack of stability in his cabinet During his two terms in office, he implemented twelve cabinet reshuffles, and some of his appointments unsettled financial markets, [106] [223] [224] such as when Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was replacedwith the little-known backbencher Des van Rooyen in the 9 December 2015 reshuffle [225] The political response was so hostile that van Rooyen was replaced by Pravin Gordhan after four days in office [226] [227] Later, on 31 March 2017, Gordhan was sacked and replaced by Malusi Gigaba Gordhan's deputy Jonas, who had alleged corruption by the Guptas a year earlier, was also fired [228] The reshuffle was criticised by senior ANC leaders including Deputy President Ramaphosa, [229] from the SACP, [230] and from members of the public, who, on 7 April, launched protests against Zuma and his government in several of South Africa's major cities [231] Another march on the Union Buildings on 12 April, Zuma's birthday, was organised by a coalition of seven opposition parties It attracted tens of thousands of protesters and the Mail & Guardian said that it was \"possibly the largest march in post-apartheid history\" [231] [232]\n\n\nSuccession\nFrom 2015, Zuma was understood to favour his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as ANC president and therefore, presumptively, as national president His critics claimed that he would use his relationship with Dlamini-Zuma to retain control of the ANC and the state, and avoid prosecution on corruption charges [233] [234] [235] She campaigned on a platform of economic transformation – so that the pro-Dlamini-Zuma faction became known as the RET faction – while her challenger, Ramaphosa, emphasised anti-corruption [236] [237] On 18 December 2017, at the ANC's 54th National Conference, Ramaphosa narrowly beat Dlamini-Zuma in a vote and succeeded Zuma as ANC president [238]\n\n\nSuccession as ANC president\nFrom 2015, Zuma was understood to favour his

vote and succeeded Zuma as ANC president [238]\n\n\nResignation\n\nOnce Ramaphosa replaced Zuma as ANC president, there was growing pressure for the latter to resign from the national presidency On 6 February 2018, Zuma's annual State of the Nation Address, scheduled for 8 February, was postponed indefinitely \"to create room for establishing a much more conducive political atmosphere\" [239] The following week, Ramaphosa and Zuma spent almost five days in talks On 12 December, when it became clear that the negotiations had failed, the ANC National Executive Committee convened an emergency meeting near Pretoria, and, after nearly ten hours of debate, decided that Zuma should be \"recalled\" by the party if he did not resign voluntarily Ramaphosa and another senior official reportedly drove to Zuma's home just after midnight to deliver the ultimatum, but Zuma refused, insisting on a three-month notice period or transition period before leaving office [240] On 13 December, the National Executive Committee publicly announced its intention to recall Zuma [241] As a party-political body, it formally lacked the authority to remove sitting presidents, though it could instruct the ANC caucus, which controlled Parliament, to remove Zuma through a motion of no confidence if he did not resign at its request [242]\n\nPost-presidency\nThe week after his resignation, Zuma attended a farewell cocktail party in his honour, hosted by Ramaphosa at Tuynhuys in Cape Town and attended by other members of cabinet [250] Although former presidents are invited to all State of the Nation addresses, Zuma did not attend Ramaphosa's addresses in 2018, 2019, or 2020 [251]\n\n\nThird corruption indictment\nOn 16 March 2018, a month after Zuma resigned from the presidency, the NPA announced that he would again face prosecution on the same 16 criminal charges he was indicted on in 2006: 12 charges of fraud, two of corruption, and one each of racketeering and money laundering, all related to the 1999 Arms Deal and to Zuma's relationship with Shaik [252] The case was enrolled in the Pietermaritzburg High Court Zuma pleaded not guilty when the trial began on 26 May 2021 [253] As of May 2024, the trial was scheduled to resume in late April 2025 after many appeals by Zuma [254]\n\n\nZondo Commission\nAt the instruction of the Public Protector and high court, in January 2018 Zuma established the Zondo Commission to investigate fraud, corruption, and state capture in the public sector in South Africa Zuma was scheduled to testify before the commission for five days in mid-July 2019, and on Monday 15 July he opened his testimony by claiming that the commission was part of a decades-long \"character assassination\" [255] conspiracy against him [256] [257] He denied the veracity of several other witnesses' testimony and questioned the appropriateness of the phrase \"state capture\", which he said was used to discredit him If the whole state had truly been captured, he argued that the commission should investigate the judiciary and Parliament as well as the executive branch of government [258] After the hearings, Zuma addressed supporters who gathered outside the commission's offices in Johannesburg [255] [259]\n\n\nTestimony\nAt the instruction of the Public Protector and high court, in January 2018 Zuma established the Zondo Commission to

investigate the judiciary and Parliament as well as the executive branch of government [258] After the hearings, Zuma addressed supporters who gathered outside the commission's offices in Johannesburg [255] [259]\n\n\nContempt of court\nIn early December, the commission issued summonses for Zuma to appear before it in the weeks of 18 January and 15 February 2021 and applied to the Constitutional Court for an order compelling Zuma to comply with the summonses, [267] which was granted on 28 January [268] [269] When Zuma did not comply with the February summons, in open defiance of the court order, the commission approached the Constitutional Court and asked it to sentence Zuma to two years' imprisonment for contempt of court [270] Zuma refused to participate in the contempt proceedings, although he complained of bias, and on 29 June 2021 he was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment [271]\n\n\nArrest and imprisonment\n\nZuma was given until 4 July to hand himself in, after which the police would have until 7 July to arrest him forcibly [272] The uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans' Association warned that his arrest would destabilise the country, [273] and hundreds of supporters gathered outside his Nkandla residence, threatening violence if he was detained [272] [274] Zuma told the press that he had been sentenced without trial, saying that it might \"remind our people of the apartheid days\", and told a rally in Nkandla:\n\nuMkhonto we Sizwe political party\nIn December 2023, Zuma announced that, while planning to remain a lifelong member of the ANC, he would not be campaigning for the ANC in the 2024 South African general election, and would instead be voting for a newly-formed party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) [293] He stated that \"I cannot and will not\" campaign for the ANC of current president Cyril Ramaphosa, Zuma's successor, and that to do so would be a 'betrayal' [294] [295] On 29 January 2024, Zuma was suspended from the ANC for his endorsement of the MK Party [296] The ANC approached South Africa's electoral court and contended that Zuma's registration of the MK Party was \"unlawful\" (as it was a name of the ANC'smilitary wing) and also took on the country's Electoral Commission for allowing its registration [297] Lawyers for the MK Party told the court that the ANC knew about the existence of the party since its registration in September 2023 but wondered why they waited this long for Zuma to endorse it before challenging it [298] Judges for the electoral court then dismissed the ANC's request and found that the MK Party's registration was lawful [299]\n\n\nPersonality and public image\nZuma's \"charisma and affable personality\" [305] is at the centre of his public image, and is thought to be responsible for much of his political popularity [306] [307] [308] His charisma is most fully on display at his political rallies, which sociologist Roger Southall describes as laden with \"political theatre\" and \"popular idiom\", [309] especially through song – his longstanding trademark is uMkhonto we Sizwe anthem \"Umshini wami\" (English: Bring Me My Machine Gun), but he also became associated with \"Yinde lendlela\" (English: It's a Long Journey) after the ANC's Mangaung conference in 2012 [310] [311] [312] Journalist Alec Russell wrote in 2009, \"When Zuma gets in front of these crowds, he is more than a politician: briefly, he becomes something closer to a revivalist preacher, or the leader of a cult.\" [313]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 2010, Zuma's bodyguards were implicated in multiple incidents involving members of the public and journalists.\n\n\nAlleged abuses by bodyguards\nIn 2010, Zuma's bodyguards were implicated in multiple incidents involving members of the public and journalists.\n\n\n\"Shoot the Boer\" song\nIn January 2012, Zuma gave a speech at the ANC Centennial 2012 celebrations in Bloemfontein and, afterwards, sang the controversial song \"Dubul' ibhunu\" (\"Shoot the Boer\") [348] [349]\n\n\n\"The Spear\" painting\nIn 2012, Zuma was featured in a satirical painting by Cape Town-based artist Brett Murray, who depicted him in his painting The Spear, with his genitals exposed The ANC responded by threatening court action against the gallery showing the painting, and further demanding that the image should be removed from online sources [350] [351] On 22 May 2012, the painting was vandalised while it was hanging in an art gallery in Johannesburg Zuma's face and genitals were painted over [352]\n\n\nPanama Papers revelations\nClive Khulubuse Zuma, Jacob Zuma's nephew, was named in the Panama Papers [353] as a result of his links to oilfields in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Shortly after Jacob Zuma met with DRC president Joseph Kabila, Khulubuse Zuma's company Caprikat Limited secured a 100-billion-rand oil deal in the DRC [354] [234] [355]\n\n\nJacob Zuma Foundation\nZuma started the foundation to send children to school and build houses for people living in poverty The former chairperson of the foundation is Dudu Myeni, [356] before she resigned from her memberships on the boards of directors of these and other bodies because she was declared a delinquent director for life in May 2020 by the Pretoria High Court [357]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nZuma is a polygamist, in line with traditional Zulu culture, and has been married six times In 2012 the Daily Telegraph estimated he had 20 children, [358] and in 2014 the Guardian reported he has 21, [359] some of whom were born out of wedlock In an interview, he said:\n\nPolygamy\n\nZuma is a polygamist, in line with traditional Zulu culture, and has been married six times In 2012 the Daily Telegraph estimated he had 20 children, [358] and in 2014 the Guardian reported he has 21, [359] some of whom were born out of wedlock In an interview, he said:\n\nWives and children\nZuma has also been engaged to other women, including, from 2002, Princess Sebentile Dlamini, a niece of Swazi King Mswati III Zuma paid the traditional lobola in cattle, [364] [380] but, as of 2022, they have not married, although the Citizen reported in 2017 that they were still engaged [381] He was also engaged to Nonkanyiso Conco (born 16 October 1993), [382] [383] a cast member on Real Housewives of Durban, but has broken off the engagement and are reportedly estranged [368] They have a child together: Sakh'muzi (born 12 April 2018) [384] [385]\n\n\n2009 \"love-child\"\nIn January 2010, the Sunday Times reported that Khoza had given birth to Zuma's daughter in 2009, [390] [391] and Zuma ultimately confirmed that he had paid inhlawulo, acknowledging paternity, and appealed for privacy [392] Opposition parties criticised Zuma's actions Both the African Christian Democratic Party and the DA said that it undermined the government's HIV/AIDS prevention programme, which promoted safe sex and marital fidelity [393] DA leader Zille also argued that it was not a purely private matter, since elected public officials had to embody the principles and values for which they stood [394] The Congress of the People said that Zuma could no longer use African cultural practices to justify his \"promiscuity\", [393] and Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille said that Zuma was asking people \"to do as I say and not as I do\"

{"title": "Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "content": "\nCreation and development\nVarious claims have been made about the origins of the character Obi-Wan Kenobi In his book about the Star Wars franchise, Chris Taylor asserted that Obi-Wan was inspired by the J.R.R Tolkien character Gandalf [5] Ben Sherlock of ScreenRant, meanwhile, claimed that the Jedi Master was based on General Makabe Rokurōta, a character from Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress [6]\n\n\nPortrayal\nWhen casting Star Wars, Lucas sought an established star for the role of Obi-Wan He considered Peter Cushing for the part, but decided the actor's lean features would be better employed as the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin [14] The film's producer, Gary Kurtz, felt a strong character actor was required to convey the \"stability and gravitas\" of Obi-Wan [15] Before Guinness was cast, the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune—who plays Makabe Rokurōta in The Hidden Fortress—was considered for the role [16] [17] Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, said her father \"had a lot of samurai pride\" and turned down the roles of both Obi-Wan and Darth Vader because he thought Star Wars would employ cheap special effects and would therefore \"cheapen the image of samurai\" [18] Once Guinness was selected and production was underway, Lucas credited the English actor with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, which contributed significantly to the completion of filming [19] Harrison Ford, who plays Han Solo in the film, said he admired Guinness' preparation, professionalism and kindness towards the other actors

"article": "**Obi-Wan Kenobi**\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. He is a Jedi Master who appears in the original trilogy and is a central character in the prequel trilogy.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is a legendary Jedi Master who plays a significant role in the Star Wars saga. He is a wise and powerful warrior who has been a part of the Jedi Order for many years. With his exceptional skills in the Force and his unwavering dedication to justice, Obi-Wan has become a beloved character in the Star Wars universe.\n\n**Creation and Development**\n\nThe character of Obi-Wan Kenobi has undergone significant development over the years. In his book about the Star Wars franchise, Chris Taylor asserted that Obi-Wan was inspired by the J.R.R Tolkien character Gandalf. Ben Sherlock of ScreenRant, meanwhile, claimed that the Jedi Master was based on General Makabe Rokurōta, a character from Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress.\n\n**Portrayal**\n\nWhen casting Star Wars, Lucas sought an established star for the role of Obi-Wan. He considered Peter Cushing for the part, but decided the actor's lean features would be better employed as the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin. The film's producer, Gary Kurtz, felt a strong character actor was required to convey the \"stability and gravitas\" of Obi-Wan. Before Guinness was cast, the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune—who plays Makabe Rokurōta in The Hidden Fortress—was considered for the role. Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, said her father \"had a lot of samurai pride\" and turned down the roles of both Obi-Wan and Darth Vader because he thought Star Wars would employ cheap special effects and would therefore \"cheapen the image of samurai.\" Once Guinness was selected and production was underway, Lucas credited the English actor with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, which contributed significantly to the completion of filming. Harrison Ford, who plays Han Solo in the film, said he admired Guinness' preparation, professionalism and kindness towards the other actors.\n\n**Appearances**\n\nObi-Wan is introduced in Star Wars (1977) as an elderly hermit living on Tatooine. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the runaway droid R2-D2, Obi-Wan rescues them from Tusken Raiders. At Obi-Wan's home, R2-D2 plays a recording of Princess Leia explaining that R2-D2 contains architectural plans for the Galactic Empire's battle station, the Death Star. Leia asks Obi-Wan to deliver R2-D2 and the plans to Alderaan to aid the Rebel Alliance. Obi-Wan reveals to Luke that he is a Jedi, a peacekeeper from the days of the Republic. He explains that Luke's father was also a Jedi, and was killed by Darth Vader. Obi-Wan gives Luke his father's lightsaber and invites him to come to Alderaan and begin Jedi training. At first Luke declines, but changes his mind after finding that his aunt and uncle have been killed by Imperial stormtroopers.\n\n**Original Trilogy**\n\nThe original trilogy consists of Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). In these films, Obi-Wan Kenobi plays a significant role in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Galactic Empire. He is a wise and powerful Jedi Master who trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force.\n\n**Prequel Trilogy**\n\nThe prequel trilogy consists of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). In these films, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young Jedi Knight who trains Anakin Skywalker to become a Jedi. He is a central character in the Clone Wars and plays a significant role in the fall of the Jedi Order.\n\n**Sequel Trilogy**\n\nThe sequel trilogy consists of The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). In these films, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a spirit who appears to Rey, the main character. He is a wise and powerful Jedi Master who helps Rey on her journey to become a Jedi.\n\n**Television**\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi appears in several animated television series, including The Clone Wars (2008-2014, 2020) and Star Wars Rebels (2014-2018). He is a central character in these series and plays a significant role in the Clone Wars and the early days of the Rebel Alliance.\n\n**Novels and Comics**\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi appears in several novels and comics, including the Star Wars Legends series. He is a central character in these stories and plays a significant role in the Star Wars universe.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi has had a significant impact on popular culture. He is a beloved character in the Star Wars franchise and has been featured in numerous films, television series, and other media. He is a symbol of wisdom, courage, and justice, and has inspired countless fans around the world.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the

(1992–1996)\nBryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high-school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman [30] Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record [30] [31] The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions [30] During his junior year, Bryant averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals [32] and

North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros [33]\n\n\nProfessional career\nIf you closed your eyes and thought a little bit, you might have thought you were watching Michael Jordan He did everything well – beyond well He was exceptional in

watching Michael Jordan He did everything well – beyond well He was exceptional in everything that he did And then we commented, as I recall, on how reminiscent he was of Michael.\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1996–2016)\nBryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris [52] Bryant scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games [53] As a rookie in 1996–97,

youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days) [55] [56] Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.\n\n\nAdjusting to the NBA

improved when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999 [71] After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA, [72] All-Star, and All-Defensive teams [73] The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view [74]\n\n\nComing up short (2002–2004)\nIn the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and four steals

nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February Bryant also averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that point [9] He was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams, [9] and came in third place in voting for the MVP award After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semifinals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs [94]\n\n\nScoring records and playoff upsets (2004–2007)\nBryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant In the book, Jackson called Bryant \"un-coachable.\" [106] Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion [107] Without him, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers' season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen [108] Bryant was the league's second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, and the Lakers went 34–48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade [109] The year signified a drop in his overall status in the NBA, as Bryant did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team [110] During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen [111] [112]\n\n\nBack on top (2007–2010)\nOn May 27, 2007, ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority [150] Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return to the franchise, but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place [151] However, three days later, on Stephen A Smith's radio program, Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers \"insider\" who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O'Neal's departure from the team, and publicly stated, \"I want to be traded.\" [152] Three hours after making that statement, Bryant stated in another interview that after having a conversation with head coach Jackson, he had reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request [153] Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd [154] [155]\n\n\nChasing a sixth championship (2010–2013)\nBryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total [202] The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games [203] In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points [204] Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009 [205] On January 30, 2011, against the Celtics, Bryant became the youngest player to score 27,000 points [206] Two days later, Bryant became one of seven players with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists [207] In Boston on February 10, Bryant scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from an early 15-point deficit for a 92–86 victory over the Celtics [208] It was the Lakers' first victory of the season against one of the league's top four teams, as they entered the game 0–5 in previous matchups and had been outscored by an average of 11 points [209] Bryant, selected to his 13th straight All-Star game after becoming the leading vote-getter, had 37 points, 14 rebounds, and three steals in the 2011 All-Star Game and won his fourth All-Star MVP, tying Hall of Famer Bob Pettit for the most All-Star MVP awards [210] [211] During the season, Bryant moved from 12th to sixth place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek, Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone [212] Bryant finished the season averaging less than 20 shots a game, his fewest since the 2003–04 season [213]\n\n\nInjury-plagued years (2013–2015)\nBryant resumed practicing in November 2013, after the 2013–14 season had already begun On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million [260] Bryant remained the league's highest-paid player, although he accepted a discounted deal; Bryant had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year [261] His contract became a polarizing topic, with detractors arguing that stars should take less money to allow their team more financial freedom, while supporters countered that the NBA's biggest stars were being paid less than their true value [262] [263] [264] Bryant resumed playing on December 8 after missing the season's first 19 games Nine days later, he matched his season high of 21 points in a 96–92 win over Memphis, but suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks [265] Bryant had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, Steve Blake, and Jordan Farmar [266] Bryant was averaging 13.8 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds [267] Despite being sidelined, he was voted by fans to start in his 16th All-Star game Bryant did not feel he was deserving of the selection, and some likened it to a career achievement award for his past performance [268] However, Bryant missed playing in the game, still hampered by his knee [269] On March 12, 2014, the Lakers ruled Bryant out for the rest of the season, citing his need for more rehab and the limited time remaining in the season At the time, the team was 22–42 and tied for the worst record in the Western Conference The Lakers finished 27–55 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005 [267]\n\n\nFinal season (2015–2016)\nAfter recovering to play in the 2015–16 preseason, [290] Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games [291] However, he played in the season opener to begin his 20th season with the Lakers, surpassing John Stockton's league record of 19 for the most seasons with the same team [292] On November 24, 2015, the Lakers fell to 2–12 after losing 111–77 to the Warriors Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots [293] [294] A week later, Bryant played his last game against his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, where the Lakers lost 103–91 [295]\n\n\nNational team career\nBryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season [318] Bryant also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship [319] He was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003, but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries [320] The following summer, Bryant had to withdraw from the Olympic team because of his sexual assault case [321] Along with LeBron James, Bryant was one of the first two players to be publicly named to the 2006–2008 U.S preliminary roster in 2006 by Jerry Colangelo [322] However, he was once again sidelined after knee surgery and did not participate in the 2006 FIBA World Championship [323]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nBryant primarily played as a shooting guard He was listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg), [331] Bryant was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA [332] [333] He has drawn frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan, after whom Bryant modeled his playing style [334] [335] [336] Like Jordan, Bryant became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot [337] Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous moves as the \"jab step-and-pause\" in which Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax but instead of bringing the jab foot back, Bryant pushed off of it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket [338]\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nBryant was the youngest of three children He grew up with two older sisters, Sharia and Shaya, and had close relationships with them until his death [8] [368]\n\n\nRegular season\nBryant was the youngest of three

excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris [52] Bryant scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games [53] As a rookie in 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel [54] At the time, he was the second-youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days) and also became the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days) [55] [56] Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.\n\n\nThree-peat (1999–2002)\nBryant's fortunes improved when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999 [71] After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA, [72] All-Star, and All-Defensive teams [73] The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O'Neal Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view [74]\n\n\nComing up short (2002–2004)\nIn the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 87–82 loss to the visiting Spurs [91] On November 1, he recorded a triple-double of 33 points, 15 rebounds, and 12 assists in a 108–93 victory over the Clippers [92] Bryant also set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics [93] He averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February Bryant also averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that point [9] He was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams, [9] and came in third place in voting for the MVP award After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semifinals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs [94]\n\n\nScoring records and playoff upsets (2004–2007)\nBryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous 2003–04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant In the book, Jackson called Bryant \"un-coachable.\" [106] Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion [107] Without him, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers' season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen [108] Bryant was the league's second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, and the Lakers went 34–48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade [109] The year signified a drop in his overall status in the NBA, as Bryant did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team [110] During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen [111] [112]\n\n\nBack on top (2007–2010)\nOn May 27, 2007, ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority [150] Bryant later confirmed his desire for West's return to the franchise, but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place [151] However, three days later, on Stephen A Smith's radio program, Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers \"insider\" who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O'Neal's departure from the team, and publicly stated, \"I want to be traded.\" [152] Three hours after making that statement, Bryant stated in another interview that after having a conversation with head coach Jackson, he had reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request [153] Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd [154] [155]\n\n\nChasing a sixth championship (2010–2013)\nBryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total [202] The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games [203] In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points [204] Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009 [205] On January 30, 2011, against the Celtics, Bryant became the youngest player to score 27,000 points [206] Two days later, Bryant became one of seven players with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists [207] In Boston on February 10, Bryant scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from an early 15-point deficit for a 92–86 victory over the Celtics [208] It was the Lakers' first victory of the season against one of the league's top four teams, as they entered the game 0–5 in previous matchups and had been outscored by an average of 11 points [209] Bryant, selected to his 13th straight All-Star game after becoming the leading vote-getter, had 37 points, 14 rebounds, and three steals in the 2011 All-Star Game and won his fourth All-Star MVP, tying Hall of Famer Bob Pettit for the most All-Star MVP awards [210] [211] During the season, Bryant moved from 12th to sixth place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek, Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone [212] Bryant finished the season averaging less than 20 shots a game, his fewest since the 2003–04 season [213]\n\n\nInjury-plagued years (2013–2015)\nBryant resumed practicing in November 2013, after the 2013–14 season had already begun On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million [260] Bryant remained the league's highest-paid player, although he accepted a discounted deal; Bryant had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year [261] His contract became a polarizing topic, with detractors arguing that stars should take less money to allow their team more financial freedom, while supporters countered that the NBA's biggest stars were being paid less than their true value [262] [263] [264] Bryant resumed playing on December 8 after missing the season's first 19 games Nine days later, he matched his season high of 21 points in a 96–92 win over Memphis, but suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks [265] Bryant had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, Steve Blake, and Jordan Farmar [266] Bryant was averaging 13.8 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds [267] Despite being sidelined, he was voted by fans to start in his 16th All-Star game Bryant did not feel he was deserving of the selection, and some likened it to a career achievement award for his past performance [268] However, Bryant missed playing in the game, still hampered by his knee [269] On March 12, 2014, the Lakers ruled Bryant out for the rest of the season, citing his need for more rehab and the limited time remaining in the season At the time, the team was 22–42 and tied for the worst record in the Western Conference The Lakers finished 27–55 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005 [267]\n\n\nFinal season (2015–2016)\nAfter recovering to play in the 2015–16 preseason, [290] Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games [291] However, he played in the season opener to begin his 20th season with the Lakers, surpassing John Stockton's league record of 19 for the most seasons with the same team [292] On November 24, 2015, the Lakers fell to 2–12 after losing 111–77 to the Warriors Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots [293] [294] A week later, Bryant played his last game against his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, where the Lakers lost 103–91 [295]\n\n\nNational team career\nBryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season [318] Bryant also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship [319] He was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003, but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries [320] The following summer, Bryant had to withdraw from the Olympic team because of his sexual assault case [321] Along with LeBron James, Bryant was one of the first two players to be publicly named to the 2006–2008 U.S preliminary roster in 2006 by Jerry Colangelo [322] However, he was once again sidelined after knee surgery and did not participate in the 2006 FIBA World Championship [323]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nBryant primarily played as a shooting guard He was listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and 212 pounds (96 kg), [331] Bryant was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA [332] [333] He has drawn frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan, after whom Bryant modeled his playing style [334] [335] [336] Like Jordan, Bryant became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot [337] Chris Ballard of Sports Illustrated described another of Bryant's most famous moves as the \"jab step-and-pause\" in which Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax but instead of bringing the jab foot back, Bryant pushed off of it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket [338]\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nBryant was the youngest of three children He grew up with two older sisters, Sharia and Shaya, and had close relationships with them until his death [8] [368]\n\n\nRegular season\nBryant was the youngest of three

Created by American cartoonist Charles Addams, Wednesday is the only daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams and the sister of Pugsley Addams. She has been portrayed by various actresses in film, television, and on stage, and has become a cultural icon of the gothic and dark aesthetic.\n\nOrigin\n--------\n\nThe Addams Family members were unnamed in The New Yorker cartoons that first appeared in 1938. The character that would later be known as Wednesday Addams first appeared in the August 26, 1944, issue of The New Yorker in an illustration captioned, \"Well, don't come whining to me Go tell him you'll poison him right back.\" When the characters were adapted for the 1964 television series, Charles Addams named Wednesday based on the Monday's Child nursery rhyme line: \"Wednesday's child is full of woe\" Actress and poet Joan Blake, an acquaintance of Charles Addams, offered the idea for the name. Wednesday is the only daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams and the sister of Pugsley Addams. Earlier adaptations depict her as the younger sibling, while later adaptations depict Wednesday as the elder Addams child.\n\nAppearance and Personality\n---------------------------\n\nWednesday Addams is a typically young girl who is obsessed with death and is described as brilliant, with a penchant for doing odd scientific experiments. Wednesday does most of her experiments on her brother Pugsley Addams for \"fun\" or for punishment. Wednesday has sometimes been shown as caring about Pugsley, but has also often been shown actively carrying out his execution; not that Pugsley typically seems to mind. She enjoys raising spiders and researching the Bermuda Triangle. She has a tendency to startle people due to her gothic appearance, and macabre interests.\n\nPhysical characteristics of Wednesday vary across different adaptations, but she is typically depicted as a pale, thin, and dark-haired girl with a stern expression. In some adaptations, she is shown wearing a habit, or a Gothic-inspired dress. In the original series, she is about six years old, while in the first original movie, she is perhaps 8 to 10 years old. In the sequel to the movie, she appears to be about 13 years old, as seems to be the case in the animated films. In the Netflix series, she is 15 and 16 years old.\n\nPortrayals\n------------\n\nWednesday has been portrayed by many actresses in film, television, and on stage, including Lisa Loring in the original 1964 television series, Christina Ricci in the 1991 movie \"The Addams Family\" and its 1993 sequel \"Addams Family Values,\" and Jenna Ortega in the 2022 Netflix series \"Wednesday.\" Each of these actresses has brought their own unique interpretation to the character, capturing her eccentric and dark personality in different ways.\n\nFamily Tree\n------------\n\nThe Addams Family is a large and extended family of eccentric and outcast individuals. Wednesday's parents, Gomez and Morticia Addams, are the patriarch and matriarch of the family. Gomez is a charming and eccentric man who is obsessed with torture and violence, while Morticia is a pale and beautiful woman who is obsessed with death and the supernatural. Wednesday's brother, Pugsley, is a young boy who is often the subject of Wednesday's experiments and tortures.\n\nWednesday has many aunts and uncles, including Uncle Fester, who is a strange and eccentric man who is obsessed with electricity, and Grandmama, who is a witch-like woman who is obsessed with magic and the supernatural. The family also has many other relatives, including cousins and aunts and uncles who are all equally eccentric and outcast.\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* Addams Family\n* Gomez Addams\n* Morticia Addams\n* Pugsley Addams\n* Uncle Fester\n* Grandmama\n* Wednesday Addams (1991 film)\n* Wednesday Addams (2022 Netflix series)\n* The Addams Family (1964 television series)\n* The Addams Family (1991 film)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wednesday_Addams\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigin\nAddams Family members were unnamed in The New Yorker cartoons that first appeared in 1938 The character that would later be known as Wednesday Addams first appeared in the August 26, 1944, issue of The New Yorker in an illustration captioned, \"Well, don't come whining to me Go tell him you'll poison him right back.\" When the characters were adapted for the 1964 television series, Charles Addams named Wednesday based on the Monday's Child nursery rhyme line: \"Wednesday's child is full of woe\" Actress and poet Joan Blake, an acquaintance of Charles Addams, offered the idea for the name [1] Wednesday is the only daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams and the sister of Pugsley Addams Earlier adaptations depict her as the younger sibling, while later adaptations depict Wednesday as the elder Addams child.\n\n\nAppearance and personality\nWednesday Addams is a typically young girl (in the original series, she is about six, in the first original movie she is perhaps 8 to 10 years old, and about 13 in its sequel, as seems to be the case in the animated films; in the Netflix series she is 15 and 16) who is obsessed with death and is described as brilliant, with a penchant for doing odd scientific experiments Wednesday does most of her experiments on her brother Pugsley Addams for \"fun\" or for punishment Wednesday has sometimes been shown as caring about Pugsley, but has also often been shown actively carrying out his execution; not that Pugsley typically seems to mind She enjoys raising spiders and researching the Bermuda Triangle She has a tendency to startle people due to her gothic appearance, and macabre interests.\n\n\nPortrayals\nWednesday has been portrayed by many actresses in film, television, and on stage:\n\n\nFamily tree\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the Tournament of Roses and that it was shaped like a bowl, much like the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut The Tournament of Roses football game thus eventually came to be known as the Rose Bowl Game Exploiting the Rose Bowl Game's popularity, post-season college football contests were created for Miami (the Orange Bowl), New Orleans (the Sugar Bowl), and El Paso (the Sun Bowl) in 1935, and for Dallas (the Cotton Bowl) in 1937 By the time the first Super Bowl was played, the term \"bowl\" for any major American football game was well established [5]\n\n\nGame history\nThe Super Bowl was held in January from its inception in 1967 until 2001 In 2002, a week of regular season games was postponed and rescheduled following the September 11 attacks;

five championships in seven years, and the second threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967) The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931) The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932.\n\n\n1970s: Dominant franchises\nAfter the AFL–NFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises—the Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Steelers—would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls between them in the decade, with the Steelers winning four of the eight.\n\n\n1981–1996: The NFC's winning streak\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI.\n\n\n1997–2009: AFC resurgence and the rise of the Patriots\nSuper Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak [72] The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game [73] The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams—the Steelers, Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts—accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010 [74]\n\n\n2010s: Patriots reign;

It is a tremendous venue.\n\n# Venues\n\nAs of Super Bowl LVIII, 29 of 58 Super Bowls have been played in three metropolitan areas: the Greater Miami area (eleven times), New Orleans (ten times), and the Greater Los Angeles area (eight times). No market or region without an active NFL franchise has ever hosted a Super Bowl, and the presence of an NFL team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on the game. For instance, while Los Angeles has been an eight-time host city, with its most recent being Super Bowl LVI in 2022, it did not host one from the departure of both its NFL teams in 1995 until the Rams and the Chargers subsequently came back to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue, with an eighth Super Bowl scheduled to take place in 2025. The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.\n\n# Selection Process\n\nThe location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event. The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium.\n\n# Home Team Designation\n\nThe designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games. This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team. Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones. Designated away teams have won 32 of 58 Super Bowls to date (approximately 55%).\n\n# Host Cities/Regions\n\nFifteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls.\n\n# Host Stadiums\n\nA total of 27 different stadiums have either hosted, or are scheduled to host, a Super Bowl, with 14 of the stadiums having hosted, or are scheduled to host, more than one Super Bowl. Seven of the Super Bowl hosting stadiums have been demolished.\n\n# Future Venues\n\nThe Super Bowl has not yet been played in any region that lacked an NFL or AFL franchise at the time the game was played.\n\n# Super Bowl Trademark\n\nThe NFL very actively seeks to prevent what it calls unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms \"NFL\", \"Super Bowl\", and \"Super Bowl Sunday\". As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it as \"The Big Game\", or other generic descriptions. A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying \"it would be super… to have a bowl… of Planters nuts while watching the big game!\" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the \"Superb Owl\". In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for \"Superb Owl\". The NFL claims that the use of the phrase \"Super Bowl\" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that \"promote a message\", while non-sporting event venues are also prohibited to show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches. Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that \"any use is prohibited\", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States.

as a result, Super Bowl XXXVI became the first edition of the game played in February Super Bowl XXXVII was held in January, but all subsequent games were held on the first Sunday in February until the schedule expansion of the 2021 season moved the game to the second Sunday [15]\n\n\n1960s: Early history and Packers dominance\nThe Packers won the first two AFL–NFL World Championship Games, later renamed Super Bowls, defeating the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders following the 1966 and 1967 seasons, respectively [16] [17] The Packers were led by quarterback Bart Starr, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for both games [18] These two championships, coupled with the Packers' NFL championships in 1961, 1962, and 1965, amount to the most successful stretch in NFL History; five championships in seven years, and the second threepeat in NFL history (1965, 1966, and 1967) The Packers are the only team to threepeat, as they also accomplished the feat in the pre-playoff era (1929, 1930 and 1931) The first playoff game in the NFL was in 1932.\n\n\n1970s: Dominant franchises\nAfter the AFL–NFL merger was completed in 1970, three franchises—the Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, and Steelers—would go on to dominate the 1970s, winning a combined eight Super Bowls between them in the decade, with the Steelers winning four of the eight.\n\n\n1981–1996: The NFC's winning streak\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the tables turned for the AFC, as the NFC dominated the Super Bowls of the new decade and most of those in the 1990s The NFC won 16 of the 20 Super Bowls during these two decades, including 13 straight from Super Bowl XIX to Super Bowl XXXI.\n\n\n1997–2009: AFC resurgence and the rise of the Patriots\nSuper Bowl XXXII saw quarterback John Elway and running back Terrell Davis lead the Denver Broncos to an upset victory over the defending champion Packers, snapping the NFC's thirteen-year winning streak [72] The following year, the Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's fifth Super Bowl appearance, his second NFL championship, and his final NFL game [73] The back-to-back victories heralded a change in momentum in which AFC teams would win nine out of 12 Super Bowls In the years between 1995 and 2018, five teams—the Steelers, Patriots, Broncos, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts—accounted for 22 of the 24 AFC Super Bowl appearances (including the last 16), with those same teams often meeting each other earlier in the playoffs In contrast, the NFC saw a different representative in the Super Bowl every season from 2001 through 2010 [74]\n\n\n2010s: Patriots reign; parity in the NFC\nIn the AFC, this era was dominated by the Patriots, with the only four other teams to represent the conference being the Steelers, Ravens, Broncos, and Chiefs The Patriots had tied a record with the 1970s Dallas Cowboys for most Super Bowl appearances in a decade with five appearances (2011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018) The Patriots also had four Super Bowl appearances in five years  They also had eight consecutive AFC championship appearances spanning 2011–2018 [89]\n\n\n2020s: Beginning of Chiefs' dominance\nIn Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in a comeback, 31–20, for their first Super Bowl title in 50 years [126] This victory marked the first time since 1991 that the NFC did not have more Super Bowl victories than the AFC Notable was the absence of the Patriots, who after making it to the Super Bowl the last three years and winning two of them, had lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs, being bested by the Tennessee Titans 20–13 [127] [128]  That game represented Tom Brady's final game as a New England Patriot [129]\n\n\nTelevision coverage and ratings\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world, with viewership overwhelmingly domestic [2] The only other annual event that gathers more viewers is the UEFA Champions League final [2] For many years, the Super Bowl has possessed a large US and global television viewership, and it is often the most-watched United States originating television program of the year [140] The game tends to have a high Nielsen television rating, which is usually around a 40 rating and 60 shares This means that, on average, more than 100 million people from the United States alone are tuned into the Super Bowl at any given moment.\n\n\nUS television rights\nThroughout most of its history, the Super Bowl has been rotated annually between the same American television networks that broadcast the NFL's regular season and postseason games.\n\n\nLead-out programming\nThe Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to programming following it on the same channel, the effects of which can last for several hours For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo television critic Alan Pergament noted that following Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: \"A paid program that ran on CBS 4 (WIVB-TV) at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.\" [157]\n\n\nCeremonies and entertainment\nInitially, it was sort of a novelty and so it didn't quite feel right But it was just like, this is the year .. Bands of our generation, you can sort of be seen on a stage like this or, like, not seen There's not a lot of middle places It is a tremendous venue.\n\nVenues\nAs of Super Bowl LVIII, 29 of 58 Super Bowls have been played in three metropolitan areas: the Greater Miami area (eleven times), [169] New Orleans (ten times), and the Greater Los Angeles area (eight times) No market or region without an active NFL franchise has ever hosted a Super Bowl, and the presence of an NFL team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on the game [170] [171] For instance, while Los Angeles has been an eight-time host city, with its most recent being Super Bowl LVI in 2022, it did not host one from the departure of both its NFL teams in 1995 until the Rams and the Chargers subsequently came back to Los Angeles in 2016 and 2017 respectively The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans has hosted seven Super Bowls, the most of any venue, with an eighth Super Bowl scheduled to take place in 2025 The Orange Bowl was the only AFL stadium to host a Super Bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive Super Bowls, hosting Super Bowls II and III.\n\n\nSelection process\nThe location of the Super Bowl is chosen at a meeting of all NFL team owners, usually three to five years before the event The game has never been played in a metropolitan area that lacked an NFL franchise at the time the game was played, although in 2007 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suggested that a Super Bowl might be played in London, perhaps at Wembley Stadium [177]\n\n\nHome team designation\nThe designated \"home team\" alternates between the NFC team in odd-numbered games and the AFC team in even-numbered games [184] [185] This alternation was initiated with the first Super Bowl, when the Packers were the designated home team Regardless of being the home or away team of record, each team has their team logo and wordmark painted in one of the end zones Designated away teams have won 32 of 58 Super Bowls to date (approximately 55%).\n\n\nHost cities/regions\nFifteen different regions have hosted Super Bowls.\n\n\nHost stadiums\nA total of 27 different stadiums have either hosted, or are scheduled to host, a Super Bowl, with 14 of the stadiums having hosted, or are scheduled to host, more than one Super Bowl Seven of the Super Bowl hosting stadiums have been demolished.\n\n\nFuture venues\nThe Super Bowl has not yet been played in any region that lacked an NFL or AFL franchise at the time the game was played [199]\n\n\nSuper Bowl trademark\nThe NFL very actively seeks to prevent what it calls unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms \"NFL\", \"Super Bowl\", and \"Super Bowl Sunday\" [206] As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it  as \"The Big Game\", or other generic descriptions [207] [208] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying \"it would be super .. to have a bowl .. of Planters nuts while watching the big game!\" and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the \"Superb Owl\" In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for \"Superb Owl\" [209] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase \"Super Bowl\" implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that \"promote a message\", while non-sporting event venues are also prohibited to show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches [210] Some critics say the NFL is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that \"any use is prohibited\", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States [210] Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 \"to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games\", and \"for other purposes\" [211]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Bird played for the Boston Celtics from 1979 to 1992, leading the team to three NBA championships and earning numerous accolades, including three NBA MVP awards. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998 and was named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1996. This article provides an overview of Bird's life, career, and legacy.\n\n## Early Life\n\nLarry Bird was born on December 7, 1956, in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia Marie (née Kerns) and Claude Joseph \"Joe\" Bird. His parents were of Irish, Scottish, and Native American descent. Bird has four brothers and a sister. His father, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War, instilled in Bird a strong work ethic and love of sports. Bird grew up in a small town and developed a passion for basketball, which he played throughout his childhood and adolescence.\n\n## College Career\n\nBird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers under head coach Bob Knight in 1974. However, after less than a month on the Indiana University campus, Bird dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming. Bird returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975. He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33-0 record. In 1979, the Sycamores played in the NCAA Championship game against Michigan State, led by Magic Johnson.\n\n## Professional Career\n\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft. He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, Bird played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, he signed a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making Bird the highest-paid rookie in sports history. Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.\n\n## Boston Celtics (1979-1992)\n\nBird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender in his rookie season (1979-80). The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference. In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists in a 114-106 victory over the Houston Rockets. On November 14, 1979, he recorded his first career triple-double with 23 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 115-111 victory over the Detroit Pistons. With averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.\n\n## MVP Threepeat (1983-1986)\n\nBird was slated to become a free agent after the 1983-84 season. In 1983, as part of a collective bargaining agreement, the NBA initially implemented a \"hard\" salary cap (meaning total player salaries could not exceed a certain limit) which would not go into effect until the 1984-85 season. The NBA quickly modified this to a \"soft cap,\" meaning the cap could be exceeded in order for a team re-sign its own free agents. This came to be erroneously known as the \"Larry Bird Rule.\" Bird signed his seven-year, $12.6 million extension in 1983, before the cap came into effect and the Celtics were actually over the cap in total player salaries (including Bird's extension) at the time the cap was implemented.\n\n## Falling Short (1986-1988)\n\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107-106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season.\n\n## Late Career (1988-1992)\n\nThe 1987-88 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9-of-10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory. Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins. Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\"\n\n## Rivalry with Magic Johnson\n\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\" Their rivalry began in college, when Bird and Indiana State lost to Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game. Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics-Lakers rivalry in the NBA. Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting thrice. Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984.\n\n## National Team Career\n\nDuring the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.\n\n## Player Profile and Legacy\n\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996, and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team.\" In 1999, Bird ranked No 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. Bird played both the small forward and power forward positions. Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020.\n\n## Coaching and Executive Careers\n\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997. In 1997, he accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers. Bird said that he would be on the job for no more than three years.

instead, Bird played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick After protracted negotiations, he signed a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making Bird the highest-paid rookie in sports history [28] [17] [29] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule [29]\n\n\nBoston Celtics (1979–1992)\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft [25] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately;

the Celtics didn't actually invoke the exception to specifically re-sign Bird, as the cap wasn't in effect  Bird signed his seven-year, $12.6 million extension in 1983, before the cap came into effect and the Celtics were actually over the cap in total player salaries (including Bird's extension) at the time the cap was implemented [46]\n\n\nFalling short (1986–1988)\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107–106, Bird stole an inbound pass Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning layup with less than a second left The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game [64] The Celtics fell short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals [65]\n\n\nLate career (1988–1992)\nThe 1987–88 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9-of-10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory [69] [70] [71] Bird finished with 34 points His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins [72] Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well I couldn't miss He couldn't miss And it went down to the last shot of the game Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\nRivalry with Magic Johnson\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\" [79] Their rivalry began in college, when Bird and Indiana State lost to Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics–Lakers rivalry in the NBA Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting thrice Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984 [80]\n\n\nNational team career\nDuring the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain [84] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points [85] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet.\" [86]\n\n\nPlayer profile and legacy\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996, [87] [88] and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998 [89] [90] He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team.\" [91] In 1999, Bird ranked No 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century He played both the small forward and power forward positions [92] Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020 [93]\n\n\nCoaching and executive careers\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997 [121] In 1997, he accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers [122] Bird said that he would be on the job for no more than three years [123] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the 1997–98 season, [124] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals [124] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts [125] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals [124] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years [126]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nNBA\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1975, Bird married Janet Condra They remained married for less than a year Following an attempted reconciliation, Bird and Condra had a daughter, Corrie, in 1977 [145]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1975, Bird married Janet Condra They remained married for less than a year Following an attempted reconciliation, Bird and Condra had a daughter, Corrie, in 1977 [145]\n\n\nCareer statistics\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nNBA statistics\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nRegular season\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nPlayoff statistics\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nCareer-highs in regular season\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nCareer-highs in playoffs\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nCollege statistics\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nHead coaching record\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nPublications\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nSee also\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nReferences\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nFurther reading\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nExternal links\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

state of Georgia, outside Atlanta, for budgetary reasons Instead, it commenced in May 2023 in Oklahoma, where the story takes place, marking Chung's return to the state after Minari [4]: 9–10  [20] [21] The move cost the crew work days and resulted in the removal of some storm sequences [21] Filming was to take place at Prairie Surf Studios for 40 days and in metro Oklahoma City for 50 days [22] Ultimately, the shoot took 60 days, approximately 70 percent of which was spent capturing driving scenes [4]: 9  [17] Other locations included the towns of Burbank, Calumet, Cashion, Chickasha, Fairview, Hinton, Kingfisher, Kremlin, El Reno, Midwest City, Okarche, Pawhuska, and Spencer [22] [23] Filming was suspended in July due to the SAG-AFTRA strike [24] As six weeks of prep time were

[4]: 22 \n\n\nPost-production\nThe film's tornadoes were created using special and visual effects, referencing footage of supercell clouds and real tornadoes shot by technical consultants, including storm chaser Sean Casey The tornado in the finale was inspired by the 2013 El Reno tornado, the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado, and a wedge tornado that struck Kansas in 2023 [4]: 33–34  [12] Scott R Fisher and Ben Snow were the special and visual effects supervisors, respectively Special effects included wind fans running at around 70 miles per hour; two jet engines operating further away from

Shropshire was the editor [32] Chung said the most challenging part about making Twisters was balancing the tone because he wanted to entertain audiences while simultaneously taking the natural disasters seriously due to their real-world impacts [21] In June 2023, amid filming, The Oklahoman reported the production budget for Twisters as nearing $200 million [22] In July 2024, the budget was listed as $155 million before print and advertising costs [33] [34]\n\n\nMusic\nBenjamin Wallfisch composed the film's score [35] The soundtrack, Twisters: The Album, was released on July 19, 2024, on

markets by Warner Bros Pictures, beginning on July 10 [42] [43] It was also released through digital formats on August 13, 2024 [44]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe Twisters soundtrack accumulated over 175 million streams between May 29 and its theatrical release; Universal released one song per week for ten weeks, then a song per day the final week In addition, the studio partnered with radio personality Bobby Bones Sporting events were significant in raising awareness to the film Universal worked with NASCAR for co-branded promo as well as MLB, Copa América, and WWE The 30-second television spot broadcast during Super Bowl LVIII amassed 29.2 million views in a day and was among the year's most-watched Super Bowl trailers Commercials for the film aired during events for All Elite Wrestling, NASCAR, the Olympic Trials, UEFA Euro Cup, UFC, and the WNBA Universal strategically put tickets on sales during the first game of the 2024 NBA Finals, made content with Dodge RAM and Wrangler, and had the cast participate in a cross-country promotional tour that exceeded New York and Los Angeles and made stops in Dallas, Chicago, and Miami Special screenings were held in Oklahoma and military bases, and discussions were held between the cast and meteorologists As a result of the marketing, Deadline Hollywood noted that the film's top-grossing cities during its opening weekend were Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Oklahoma City, and San Antonio, and that theater chains in Middle America like B&B Theatres and Santikos Theatres surged over annual norms [45] The publication also said the film's \"not political\" standing (by not referring to climate change) appealed to \"red states\"; despite it, PostTrak reported that of opening weekend moviegoers, 16% were registered Democrats while 7% were registered Republicans The highest-grossing theater that weekend was Regal Warren in Moore, Oklahoma, at over $130,000 [34]\n\n\nReception\nAs of October 9, 2024 [update],

[update], Twisters has grossed $267.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $103.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $371 million [2] [3]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of 388 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Summoning a storm of spectacle and carried along by the gale force winds of Glen Powell's charisma, Twisters' forecast is splendid with a high chance of thrills.\" [60] According to the website, critics felt that Chung added \"more substance\" to the film and praised the film's visuals and \"unexpectedly well-handled romantic twist\", calling it a \"rousing piece of summer blockbuster cinema\" [61] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [62] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 4.5 out of five stars [34]\n\n\nScientific accuracy\nThe producers of Twisters consulted with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during development, with the federal agency contributing logos and props [68] The agency added that its contribution to scientific accuracy was only reflected \"in some parts\" of the film A scientific review in The New York Times pointed out impossibilities with the film's mechanism for dissipating tornadoes, observing that the method suggested would require many tons of the chemicals used and require a much longer period [69] A professor at Texas A&M University also remarked: \"it's highly unlikely that the small-scale methods depicted in the movie would have any real impact on tornadoes To my knowledge, no one is actively pursuing such an approach\" [70] An article in Wired noted that the \"twin\" tornadoes featured in the film do occur in real-life as multiple-vortex tornadoes, drawing comparison to the Dunlap, Indiana tornado during the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak [71]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article":

story takes place, marking Chung's return to the state after Minari [4]: 9–10  [20] [21] The move cost the crew work days and resulted in the removal of some storm sequences [21] Filming was to take place at Prairie Surf Studios for 40 days and in metro Oklahoma City for 50 days [22] Ultimately, the shoot took 60 days, approximately 70 percent of which was spent capturing driving scenes [4]: 9  [17] Other locations included the towns of Burbank, Calumet, Cashion, Chickasha, Fairview, Hinton, Kingfisher, Kremlin, El Reno, Midwest City, Okarche, Pawhuska, and Spencer [22] [23] Filming was suspended in July due to the SAG-AFTRA strike [24] As six weeks of prep time were necessary to resume production, despite only having three weeks of material to film, the crew began prepping sets before the strike was over [4]: 11  Production resumed with the strike's conclusion in November and wrapped the following month [25] [26] Dan Mindel was the cinematographer [4]: 29  Patrick Sullivan, who worked on the original film's art department, was the production designer [4]: 22 \n\n\nPost-production\nThe film's tornadoes were created using special and visual effects, referencing footage of supercell clouds and real tornadoes shot by technical consultants, including storm chaser Sean Casey The tornado in the finale was inspired by the 2013 El Reno tornado, the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado, and a wedge tornado that struck Kansas in 2023 [4]: 33–34  [12] Scott R Fisher and Ben Snow were the special and visual effects supervisors, respectively Special effects included wind fans running at around 70 miles per hour; two jet engines operating further away from the sets at 170-to-180 miles per hour; dump tanks; high-pressure pneumatic water cannons; and polyacrylamide for hail Visual effects were handled by Industrial Light & Magic [4]: 34–35  Terilyn A Shropshire was the editor [32] Chung said the most challenging part about making Twisters was balancing the tone because he wanted to entertain audiences while simultaneously taking the natural disasters seriously due to their real-world impacts [21] In June 2023, amid filming, The Oklahoman reported the production budget for Twisters as nearing $200 million [22] In July 2024, the budget was listed as $155 million before print and advertising costs [33] [34]\n\n\nMusic\nBenjamin Wallfisch composed the film's score [35] The soundtrack, Twisters: The Album, was released on July 19, 2024, on CD, LP, and digital download by Atlantic Records [36] [37] It features 29 songs from primarily country acts, including Luke Combs, Miranda Lambert, Bailey Zimmerman, Megan Moroney, Tucker Wetmore, Tanner Adell, Jelly Roll, and others [38] [39] Combs' \"Ain't No Love in Oklahoma\" led the soundtrack as a single on May

final week In addition, the studio partnered with radio personality Bobby Bones Sporting events were significant in raising awareness to the film Universal worked with NASCAR for co-branded promo as well as MLB, Copa América, and WWE The 30-second television spot broadcast during Super Bowl LVIII amassed 29.2 million views in a day and was among the year's most-watched Super Bowl trailers Commercials for the film aired during events for All Elite Wrestling, NASCAR, the Olympic Trials, UEFA Euro Cup, UFC, and the WNBA Universal strategically put tickets on sales during the first game of the 2024 NBA Finals, made content with Dodge RAM and Wrangler, and had the cast participate in a cross-country promotional tour that exceeded New York and Los Angeles and made stops in Dallas, Chicago, and Miami Special screenings were held in Oklahoma and military bases, and discussions were held between the cast and meteorologists As a result of the marketing, Deadline Hollywood noted that the film's top-grossing cities during its opening weekend were Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Oklahoma City, and San Antonio, and that theater chains in Middle America like B&B Theatres and Santikos Theatres surged over annual norms [45] The publication also said the film's \"not political\" standing (by not referring to climate change) appealed to \"red states\"; despite it, PostTrak reported that of opening weekend moviegoers, 16% were registered Democrats while 7% were registered Republicans The highest-grossing theater that weekend was Regal Warren in Moore, Oklahoma, at over $130,000 [34]\n\n\nReception\nAs of October 9, 2024 [update], Twisters has grossed $267.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $103.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of

consensus reads: \"Summoning a storm of spectacle and carried along by the gale force winds of Glen Powell's charisma, Twisters' forecast is splendid with a high chance of thrills.\" [60] According to the website, critics felt that Chung added \"more substance\" to the film and praised the film's visuals and \"unexpectedly well-handled romantic twist\", calling it a \"rousing piece of summer blockbuster cinema\" [61] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [62] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it 4.5 out of five stars [34]\n\n\nScientific accuracy\nThe producers of Twisters consulted with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during development, with the federal agency contributing logos and props [68] The agency added that its contribution to scientific accuracy was only reflected \"in some parts\" of the film A scientific review in The New York Times pointed out impossibilities with the film's mechanism for dissipating tornadoes, observing that the method suggested would require many tons of the chemicals used and require a much longer period [69] A professor at Texas A&M University also remarked: \"it's highly unlikely that the small-scale methods depicted in the movie would have any real impact on tornadoes To my knowledge, no one is actively pursuing such an approach\" [70] An article in Wired noted that the \"twin\" tornadoes featured in the film do occur in real-life as multiple-vortex tornadoes, drawing comparison to the Dunlap, Indiana tornado during the 1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak [71]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Advaita_Vedanta", "content": "\nEtymology and nomenclature\nThe word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words:\n\n\nAdvaita Vedanta\nWhile \"a preferred terminology\" for Upanisadic philosophy \"in the early periods, before the time of Shankara\" was Puruṣavāda, [47] [note 12] the Advaita Vedānta school has historically been referred to by various names, such as Advaita-vada (speaker of Advaita), Abheda-darshana (view of non-difference), Dvaita-vada-pratisedha (denial of dual distinctions), and Kevala-dvaita (non-dualism of the isolated) [48] It is also called māyāvāda by Vaishnava opponents, akin to Madhyamaka Buddhism, due to their insistence that phenomena ultimately lack an inherent essence or reality, [49] [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nAdvaita tradition\nWhile the term \"Advaita Vedanta\" in a strict sense may refer to the scholastic tradition of textual exegesis established by Shankara, \"advaita\" in a broader sense may refer to a broad current of advaitic thought, which incorporates advaitic elements with yogic thought and practice and other strands of Indian religiosity, such as Kashmir Shaivism and the Nath tradition [57] The first connotation has also been called \"Classical Advaita\" [26] [58] and \"doctrinal Advaita,\" [59] and its presentation as such is due to mediaeval doxographies, [39] the influence of Orientalist Indologists like Paul Deussen, [60] and the Indian response to colonial influences, dubbed neo-Vedanta by Paul Hacker, who regarded it as a deviation from \"traditional\" Advaita Vedanta [26] Yet, post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta incorporated yogic elements, such as the Yoga Vasistha, and influenced other Indian traditions, and neo-Vedanta is based on this broader strand of Indian thought [26] This broader current of thought and practice has also been called \"greater Advaita Vedanta,\" [19] \"vernacular advaita,\" [26] and \"experiential Advaita.\" [59] It is this broader advaitic tradition which is commonly presented as \"Advaita Vedanta,\" though the term \"advaitic\" may be more apt [26] [note 15]\n\n\nMonism\nThe nondualism of Advaita Vedānta is often regarded as an idealist monism [note 2] According to King, Advaita Vedānta developed \"to its ultimate extreme\" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads [note 16] In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedānta \"monistic,\" since this confuses the \"negation of difference\" with \"conflation into one.\" [61] Advaita is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the \"negation of a difference,\" between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived  [61]\n\n\nDarśana (view) – central concerns\nVedānta is one of the six classical Hindu darśanas, the Indian traditions of religious philosophy and practice which accept the authority of the Vedas The various schools of Vedanta aim to harmonise the diverging views presented in the Prasthantrayi, the Principal Upanishads, [65] [66] along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gitā, offering an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices which aim at the attainment of moksha, release or liberation from transmigratory existence [67] [68] [note 17]\n\n\nRejection of samkhya-dualism\n\"Samkhya is not one of the systems of Indian philosophy Samkhya is the philosophy of India!\"\n\n\nTheoretical difficulties\nBy accepting that Brahman is the sole reality, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedānta traditions offer different answers for: [76] [73] [74] First, how did Brahman, which is sat ('existence'), without any distinction, become manifold material universe? Second, how did Brahman, which is cit ('consciousness'), create the material world? Third, if Brahman is ananda ('bliss'), why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? The Brahma Sutras do not answer these philosophical queries, and later Vedantins including Shankara had to resolve them [76]\n\n\nRelation between jivatman and Atman/Brahman\nA main question in all schools of Vedanta is the relation between the individual self (jiva) and Atman/Brahman [80] As Shankara and his followers regard Atman/Brahman to be the ultimate Real, jivanatman is \"ultimately  [to be] of the nature of Atman/Brahman.\" [73] [4] This truth is established from a literal reading of selected parts [81] of the oldest Principal Upanishads and Brahma Sutras, and is also found in parts of the Bhagavad Gitā and numerous other Hindu texts, [2] and is regarded to be self-evident [82] [note 18] Great effort is made to show the correctness of this reading, and its compatibility with reason and experience, by criticizing other systems of thought [82] Vidya, correct knowledge or understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman, destroys or makes null avidya ('false knowledge'), and results in liberation [84] [note 19]\n\n\nReality and ignorance\nClassical Advaita Vedānta states that all reality and everything in the experienced world has its root in Brahman, which is unchanging intelligent Consciousness [2] To Advaitins, there is no duality between a Creator and the created universe [2] [85] All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness are somehow also this one fundamental reality Brahman [2] Yet, the knowing self has various experiences of reality during the waking, dream and dreamless states, [86] and Advaita Vedānta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions [87] Advaita explains this by postulating different levels of reality, [88] [89] [90] [86] and by its theory of errors (anirvacaniya khyati) [91] [2]\n\n\nThree levels of Reality/truth\nShankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion: [88] [89] [90]\n\n\nPāramārthika - Sat (True Reality)\nĀtman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is the \"real self\" [101] [102] [103] [104] [note 21] or \"essence\" [web 5] [note 22] of the individual It is caitanya, Pure Consciousness, [105] a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (svaprakashata),\" [104] and, states Payne, \"in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging.\" [note 22] It is self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual [106] It is \"a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality.\" [107] Ātman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness [108] According to Ram-Prasad, \"it\" is not an object, but \"the irreducible essence of being  [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.\" [109]\n\n\nĀtman\nĀtman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is the \"real self\" [101] [102] [103] [104] [note 21] or \"essence\" [web 5] [note 22] of the individual It is caitanya, Pure Consciousness, [105] a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (svaprakashata),\" [104] and, states Payne, \"in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging.\" [note 22] It is self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual [106] It is \"a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality.\" [107] Ātman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness [108] According to Ram-Prasad, \"it\" is not an object, but \"the irreducible essence of being  [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.\" [109]\n\n\nThree states of consciousness and Turiya\nAdvaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings, [117] [118] and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine: [119]\n\n\nSvayam prakāśa (self-luminosity)\nBrahma Jnanavali Mala, attributed to Adi Shankara: [web 8]\n\n\nBrahman\nAccording to Advaita Vedānta, Brahman is the true Self, consciousness, awareness, intelligent, possesed with will, and the only Reality (Sat) [136] [137] [138] [note 26] Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, \"Absolute Truth\" [139] or absolute Real [140] It is That which is unborn and unchanging, [137] [141] and immortal [note 7] Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya Brahman is \"not sublatable\", [136] which means it cannot be superseded by a still higher reality: [142]\n\n\nVyāvahārika (conventional reality) – Avidya and Māyā\nAvidyā is a central tenet of Shankara's Advaita, and became the main target of Ramanuja's criticism of Shankara [156] [157] In Shankara's view, avidyā is adhyasa, \"the superimposition of the qualities of one thing upon another.\" [158] As Shankara explains in the Adhyasa-bhasya, the introduction to the Brahmasutrabhasya:\n\n\nAvidyā (ignorance)\nAvidyā is a central tenet of Shankara's Advaita, and became the main target of Ramanuja's criticism of Shankara [156] [157] In Shankara's view, avidyā is adhyasa, \"the superimposition of the qualities of one thing upon another.\" [158] As Shankara explains in the Adhyasa-bhasya, the introduction to the Brahmasutrabhasya:\n\n\nMāyā (appearance)\nIn Advaita Vedanta, the perceived empirical world, \"including people and other existence,\" is Māyā, \"appearance.\" [169] [170] Jiva, conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, and misunderstands and interprets the physical, changing world as the sole and final reality [169] Due to avidya, we take the phenomenal world to be the final reality, [web 10] while in Reality only Sat ( True Reality, Brahman) is Real and unchanging [171]\n\n\nFive koshas (sheaths)\nDue to avidya, atman is covered by koshas (sheaths or bodies), which hide man's true nature According to the Taittiriya Upanishad, the Atman is covered by five koshas, usually rendered \"sheath\" [173] They are often visualized like the layers of an onion [174] From gross to fine the five sheaths are:\n\n\nParinamavada and vivartavada - causality and change\nCause and effect are an important topic in all schools of Vedanta [note 33] Two sorts of causes are recognised, namely Nimitta kāraṇa, the efficient cause, that which causes the existence of the universe, and Upādāna kāraṇa, the material cause, that from which the matery of this universe comes [176] All schools of Vedānta agree that Brahman is both the material and the efficient cause, and all subscribe to the theory of Satkāryavāda, [web 12] which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause [8] [note 34]\n\n\nMoksha – liberating knowledge of Brahman\nThe soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge as being in essence (Atman), awareness or witness-consciousness, and complete understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman [14] Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is the attainment of Brahman, immortality, [181] and leads to moksha (liberation) from suffering [note 38] and samsara, the cycle of rebirth [14] This is stated by Shankara as follows:\n\n\nKnowledge is liberating\nThe soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge as being in essence (Atman), awareness or witness-consciousness, and complete understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman [14] Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is the attainment of Brahman, immortality, [181] and leads to moksha (liberation) from suffering [note 38] and samsara, the cycle of rebirth [14] This is stated by Shankara as follows:\n\n\nAttaining vidyā (knowledge)\nAdvaita Vedānta regards the liberated state of being Atman-Brahman as one's true identity and inherent to being human According to Shankara and the Vivarana-school, no human action can 'produce' this liberated state, as it is what one already is [30] As Swami Vivekananda stated:\n\n\nPreparation: the fourfold qualities\nThe Advaita student has to develop the fourfold qualities, [193] or behavioral qualifications (Samanyasa, Sampattis, sādhana-catustaya): [194] [195] [196] [note 42] A student in Advaita Vedānta tradition is required to develop these four qualities:\n\n\nThe threefold practice: sravana (hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation)\nThe Advaita tradition teaches that correct knowledge, which destroys avidya, psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, [16] is obtained in jnanayoga through three stages of practice, [195] sravana (hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation) [34] This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: [191] [192]\n\n\nGuru\nAdvaita Vedānta school has traditionally had a high reverence for a Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality, though this is not mandatory [211] Reading of Vedic literature and reflection is the most essential practice [211] Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words \"such as Sastracaryopadesa (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and Vedāntacaryopadesa (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru\" [211] According to Comans, this reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization [212] Nevertheless, in the Bhamati-school the guru has a less essential role, as he can explain the teachings, but the student has to venture its further study [213]\n\n\nPramana (means of knowledge)\nIn classical Indian thought, pramana (means of knowledge) concerns questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired [215] [216] In contrast to other schools of Indian philosophy, early Vedanta paid little attention to pramana [217] The Brahmasutras are not concerned with pramana, and pratyaksa (sense-perception) and anumana (inference) refer there to sruti and smriti respectively [217] Shankara recognized the means of knowledge, [218] [note 45] but his thematic focus was upon metaphysics and soteriology, and he took for granted the pramanas [223] For Shankara, sabda is the only means of knowledge for attaining Brahman-jnana [224] According to Sengaku Mayeda, \"in no place in his works  [...] does he give any systematic account of them,\" [223] taking Atman-Brahman to be self-evident (svapramanaka) and self-established (svatahsiddha), and \"an investigation of the means of knowledge is of no use for the attainment of final release.\" [223]\n\n\nSamadhi\nThe Advaita tradition emphasizes that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no 'action', that is, striving and effort, as articulated by Shankara; [29] yet, it also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including yogic samadhi, posing a paradox which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions [231] [35] [note 10]\n\n\nAnubhava ('experience')\nThe role of anubhava, anubhuti (\"experience,\" \"intuition\" [235]) as \"experience\" in gaining Brahman-jnana is contested While neo-Vedanta claims a central position for anubhava as \"experience,\" Shankara himself regarded reliance on textual authority as sufficient for gaining Brahman-jnana, [236] [note 46] \"the intuition of Brahman,\" [235] and used anubhava interchangeably with pratipatta, \"understanding\" [237] Arvind Sharma argues that Shankara's own \"direct experience of the ultimate truth\" guided him in selecting \"those passages of the scriptures that resonate with this experience and will select them as the key with which to open previously closed, even forbidden, doors.\" [238] [note 47]\n\n\nAdhyaropa Apavada - imposition and negation\nSince Gaudapada, [243] who adopted the Buddhist four-cornered negation which negates any positive predicates of 'the Absolute', [244] [245] [note 48] a central method in Advaita Vedanta to express the inexpressable is the method called Adhyaropa Apavada [243] In this method, which was highly estimated by Satchidanandendra Saraswati, a property is imposed (adhyaropa) on Atman to convince one of its existence, whereafter the imposition is removed (apavada) to reveal the true nature of Atman as nondual and undefinable [247] In this method, \"That which cannot be expressed is expressed through false attribution and subsequent denial.\" [248] As Shankara writes, \"First let me bring them on the right path, and then I will gradually be able to bring them round to the final truth afterwards.\" [248] For example, Atman, the real \"I,\" is described as witness, giving \"it\"  an attribute to separate it from non-self Since this implies a duality between observer and observed, next the notion of \"witness\" is dropped, by showing that the Self cannot be seen and is beyond qualifications, and only that what is remains, without using any words: [web 18]\n\n\nThe Mahavyakas - the identity of Ātman and Brahman\nMoksha, liberation from suffering and rebirth and attaining immortality, is attained by disidentification from the body-mind complex and gaining self-knowledge as being in essence Atman, and attaining knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman [14] [181] According to Shankara, the individual Ātman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical [249] The real self is Sat, \"the Existent,\" that is, Atman-Brahman [250] [251] [note 1] Whereas the difference between Atman and non-Atman is deemed self-evident, knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman is revealed by the shruti, especially the Upanishadic statement tat tvam asi.\n\n\nMahavakyas\nAccording to Shankara, a large number of Upanishadic statements reveal the identity of Atman and Brahman In the Advaita Vedanta tradition, four of those statements, the Mahavakyas, which are taken literal, in contrast to other statements, have a special importance in revealing this identity [81] [252] They are:\n\n\nThat you are\nThe longest chapter of Shankara's Upadesasahasri, chapter 18, \"That Art Thou,\" is devoted to considerations on the insight \"I am ever-free, the existent\" (sat), and the identity expressed in Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7 in the mahavakya (great sentence) \"tat tvam asi\", \"that thou art.\" [264] [265] In this statement, according to Shankara, tat refers to 'Sat, [265] \"the Existent\" [256] [7] [266] [267] Existence, Being, [web 20] or Brahman, [268] the Real, the \"Root of the world,\" [265] [note 51] the true essence or root or origin of everything that exists [7] [266] [web 20] \"Tvam\" refers to one's real I, pratyagatman or inner Self, [269] the \"direct Witness within everything,\" [18] \"free from caste, family, and purifying ceremonies,\" [270] the essence, Atman, which the individual at the core is [271] [272] As Shankara states in the Upadesasahasri: \n\n\nDirect perception versus contemplation of the Mahavakyas\nIn the Upadesasahasri Shankara, Shankara is ambivalent on the need for meditation on the Upanishadic mahavakya He states that \"right knowledge arises at the moment of hearing,\" [31] and rejects prasamcaksa or prasamkhyana meditation, that is, meditation on the meaning of the sentences, and in Up.II.3 recommends parisamkhyana, [279] separating Atman from everything that is not Atman, that is, the sense-objects and sense-organs, and the pleasant and unpleasant things and merit and demerit connected with them [280] Yet, Shankara then concludes with declaring that only Atman exists, stating that \"all the sentences of the Upanishads concerning non-duality of Atman should be fully contemplated, should be contemplated.\" [281] As Mayeda states, \"how they  [prasamcaksa or prasamkhyana versus parisamkhyana] differ from each other in not known.\" [282]\n\n\nRenouncement of ritualism\nIn the Upadesasahasri Shankara discourages ritual worship such as oblations to Deva (God), because that assumes the Self within is different from Brahman [note 52] [note 53] The \"doctrine of difference\" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, \"he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman\" [295] [296] The false notion that Atman is different from Brahman [274] is connected with the novice's conviction that (Upadesasaharsi II.1.25)\n\n\nEthics\nSome claim, states Deutsch, \"that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character\" [304] However, Deutsch adds, ethics does have a firm place in this philosophy Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers \"an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary\" [304] [305] According to Advaita Vedānta, states Deutsch, there cannot be \"any absolute moral laws, principles or duties\", instead in its axiological view Atman is \"beyond good and evil\", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of \"distinctionless Oneness\" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman [306] Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own Self and another being's, good and just Karma [307]\n\n\nTexts\nThe Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gitā and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, lending authority to the doctrines about the identity of Atman and Brahman and their changeless nature [314] [315]\n\n\nPrasthanatrayi\nThe Vedānta tradition provides exegeses of the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavadgita, collectively called the Prasthanatrayi, literally, three sources [316] [314] [315]\n\n\nTextual authority\nThe Advaita Vedānta tradition considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its karma-kanda (ritual injunctions) [314] The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman-Brahman are found in the Upanishads, which Advaita Vedānta has regarded as \"errorless revealed truth.\" [314] Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories [314]\n\n\nOther texts\nA large number of texts are attributed to Shankara; of these texts, the Brahma Sutra Bhasya (commentary on the Brahma Sutras), the commentaries on the principal Upanishads, and the Upadesasahasri are considered genuine and stand out.\n\n\nSampradaya and Smarta tradition\nAdvaita Vedānta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation Philosophy and renunciation are closely related: [web 22]\n\n\nMonastic order - Mathas\nAdvaita Vedānta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation Philosophy and renunciation are closely related: [web 22]\n\n\nSmarta Tradition\nThe Smarta tradition of Hinduism is a synthesis of various strands of Indian religious thought and practice, which developed with the Hindu synthesis, dating back to the early first century CE [note 62] It is particularly found in south and west India, and revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit [342] [343] [344] Their worship practice is called Panchayatana puja [345] [342] The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee's preference [343] [346]\n\n\nBuddhist influences\nAdvaita Vedānta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism [351] [352] According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\" [351] Murti notices that \"the ultimate goal\" of Vedanta, Samkhya and Mahayana Buddhism is \"remarkably similar\"; while Advaita Vedanta postulates a \"foundational self,\" \"Mahayana Buddhism implicitly affirms the existence of a deep underlying reality behind all empirical manifestations in its conception of sunyata (the indeterminate, the void), or vijnapti-matrata (consciousness only), or tathata (thatness), or dharmata (noumenal reality).\" [134] According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism [353]\n\n\nSimilarities\nAdvaita Vedānta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism [351] [352] According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\" [351] Murti notices that \"the ultimate goal\" of Vedanta, Samkhya and Mahayana Buddhism is \"remarkably similar\"; while Advaita Vedanta postulates a \"foundational self,\" \"Mahayana Buddhism implicitly affirms the existence of a deep underlying reality behind all empirical manifestations in its conception of sunyata (the indeterminate, the void), or vijnapti-matrata (consciousness only), or tathata (thatness), or dharmata (noumenal reality).\" [134] According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism [353]\n\n\nMahayana influences\nThe influence of Mahayana Buddhism on Advaita Vedānta has been significant [353] [354] Sharma points out that the early commentators on the Brahma Sutras were all realists, or pantheist realists He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th-6th centuries CE when Buddhist thought developing in the Yogacara school [355]\n\n\nDifferences from Buddhism\nThe Advaita Vedānta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on Atman, Anatta and Brahman [364] Yet, some Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's Tathāgatagarbha sūtras suggest self-like concepts, variously called Tathāgatagarbha or Buddha nature [365] [366] In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality [367] [368] Some scholars posit that the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists [369] [370] [371]\n\n\nCriticisms of concurring Hindu schools\nSome Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its Maya and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism [381] [353] sometimes referring to the Advaita-tradition as Māyāvāda [382]\n\n\nRelationship with other forms of Vedānta\nThe Advaita Vedānta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedānta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism) of Ramanuja, and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya [384] Their application of Vedanta philosophy to ground their faith turned Vedanta into a major factor in India's religious landscape [385]\n\n\nVishishtadvaita\nRamanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedānta schools, [386] [387] both are premised on the assumption that all Selfs can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedānta believed that some Selfs are eternally doomed and damned [388] [389] Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence [390] [391] Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (Self) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the nirguna Brahman [387] [392] [393] In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and saguna Brahman with attributes is also real [391] God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God's body [386] The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (saguna Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with nirguna Brahman [386] [390] [391]\n\n\nShuddhadvaita\nVallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world [394] That is why shuddhadvaita is known as 'Unmodified transformation' or 'Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda' Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the world Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a 'part' (but devoid of bliss) [395]\n\n\nDvaita\nMadhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Vedānta Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are identical (both in bondage and liberation [396]), there is interconnected oneness of all Selfs and Brahman, and there are no pluralities [397] [398] Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are different (both in bondage and liberation [396]), only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual Selfs are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities [397] [398] Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedānta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought [399] Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including Upadhikhandana and Tattvadyota, primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita [399]\n\n\nInfluence on other traditions\nWithin the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, the ideas of Advaita Vedānta have had a major influence [note 67] Advaita Vedānta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India [400] One of its most popular text, the Bhagavata Purana, adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedānta philosophy [401] [402] [403] The Bhagavata Purana is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE [404] [405]\n\n\nHistory of Advaita Vedānta\nThe historiography of Advaita Vedanta is coloured by Orientalist notions, [418] [note 69] while modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta, which developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism [420] have \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought.\" [421] According to Michael S Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan, \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [422]\n\n\nHistoriography\nThe historiography of Advaita Vedanta is coloured by Orientalist notions, [418] [note 69] while modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta, which developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism [420] have \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought.\" [421] According to Michael S Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan, \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [422]\n\n\nEarly Vedānta\nThe Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedānta gives an interpretation [423] The Upanishads do not contain \"a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments\" [424] [note 70] This philosophical inquiry was performed by the darsanas, the various philosophical schools [426] [note 71]\n\n\nEarly Advaita Vedānta\nTwo Advaita writings predating Maṇḍana Miśra and Shankara were known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, namely the Vākyapadīya, written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century [20]), and the Māndūkya-kārikā written by Gauḍapāda (7th century) [21] Later scholarship added the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE [432]) to the earliest known corpus, some of which are of a sectarian nature, [433] and have a strong Advaita Vedānta outlook [434] [435] [436]\n\n\nGauḍapāda and Māṇḍukya Kārikā\nAccording to tradition, Gauḍapāda (6th century) [437] was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara Gauḍapāda wrote or compiled [438] the Māṇḍukya Kārikā, also known as the Gauḍapāda Kārikā or the Āgama Śāstra [439] The Māṇḍukya Kārikā is a commentary in verse form on the Māṇḍūkya Upanishad, one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedānta, the oldest surviving complete text is the Māṇḍukya Kārikā [440] The Māṇḍūkya Upanishad was considered to be a Śruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important [439] In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy The entire Karika became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era [441] [note 72]\n\n\nEarly medieval period - Maṇḍana Miśra and Adi Shankara\nMaṇḍana Miśra, an older contemporary of Shankara, [447] was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the Brahma-siddhi [448] [449] According to Fiordalis, he was influenced by the Yoga-tradition, and with that indirectly by Buddhism, given the strong influence of Buddhism on the Yoga-tradition [36] For a couple of centuries he seems to have been regarded as \"the most important representative of the Advaita position,\" [28] [284] [note 76] and the \"theory of error\" set forth in the Brahma-siddhi became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error [450]\n\n\nMaṇḍana Miśra\nMaṇḍana Miśra, an older contemporary of Shankara, [447] was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the Brahma-siddhi [448] [449] According to Fiordalis, he was influenced by the Yoga-tradition, and with that indirectly by Buddhism, given the strong influence of Buddhism on the Yoga-tradition [36] For a couple of centuries he seems to have been regarded as \"the most important representative of the Advaita position,\" [28] [284] [note 76] and the \"theory of error\" set forth in the Brahma-siddhi became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error [450]\n\n\nAdi Shankara\nVery little is known about Shankara According to Dalal, \"Hagiographical accounts of his life, the Śaṅkaravijayas (\"Conquests of Śaṅkara\"), were composed several centuries after his death,\" [web 17] in the 14th to 17th century, and established Shankara as a rallying symbol of values in a time when most of India was conquered by Muslims [27] He is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedānta school, but was actually a systematizer, not a founder [web 17] [451]\n\n\nSystematizer of Advaita thought\nShankara was a scholar who synthesized and systematized Advaita-vāda thought which already existed at his lifetime [451] According to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of the early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought \"were advocated by someone before Śankara\" [451] According to Nakamura, after the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedānta, culminating in the works of Gauḍapāda, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, [452] synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita [453] According to Koller, using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Vedānta in the 8th century, reforming Badarayana's Vedānta tradition [454] According to Mayeda, Shankara represents a turning point in the development of Vedānta, [452] yet he also notices that it is only since Deussens's praise that Shankara \"has usually been regarded as the greatest philosopher of India.\" [455] Mayeda further notes that Shankara was primarily concerned with moksha, \"and not with the establishment of a complete system of philosophy or theology,\" [455] following Potter, who qualifies Shankara as a \"speculative philosopher.\" [456] Lipner notes that Shankara's \"main literary approach was commentarial and hence perforce disjointed rather than procedurally systematic  [...] though a systematic philosophy can be derived from Samkara's thought.\" [457]\n\n\nWritings\nAdi Shankara is best known for his reviews and commentaries (Bhasyas) on ancient Indian texts His Brahmasutrabhasya (literally, commentary on Brahma Sutra) is a fundamental text of the Vedānta school of Hinduism [329] His commentaries on ten Mukhya (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars [329] [458] Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gitā (part of his Prasthana Trayi Bhasya) [239] He also authored Upadesasahasri, his most important original philosophical work [454] [459] The authenticity of Shankara being the author of Vivekacūḍāmaṇi [460] has been questioned, and \"modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara.\" [461]\n\n\nInfluence of Shankara\nWhile Shankara has an unparalleled status in the history of Advaita Vedanta, scholars have questioned the traditional narrative of Shankara's early influence in India [27] [28] [284] Until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Maṇḍana Miśra, who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita [28] [284] Only when Vacaspati Misra, an influential student of Maṇḍana Miśra, harmonised the teachings of Shankara with those of Maṇḍana Miśra, Shankara's teachings gained prominence [462] Some modern Advaitins argue that most of post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta actually deviates from Shankara, and that only his student Suresvara, who's had little influence, represents Shankara correctly [463] In this view, Shankara's influential student Padmapada misunderstood Shankara, while his views were manitained by the Suresvara school [463] According to Satchidanandendra Sarasvati, \"almost all the later Advaitins were influenced by Mandana Misra and Bhaskara.\" [464] [note 9] Until the 11th century, Vedanta itself was a peripheral school of thought; [465] Vedanta became a major influence when Vedanta philosophy was utilized by various sects of Hinduism to ground their doctrines, [385] such as Ramanuja (11th c.), who aligned bhakti, \"the major force in the religions of Hinduism,\" with philosophical thought, meanwhile rejecting Shankara's views [web 29]\n\n\nAdvaita Vedanta sub-schools\nTwo defunct schools are the Pancapadika and Istasiddhi, which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school [287] The still existing Bhāmatī and Vivarana developed in the 11th-14th century [web 30] [213] These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of māyā and avidya [web 30]\n\n\nLate medieval India\nMichael S Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studied, but \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [422]\n\n\nVidyāraṇya\nIt is only during this period that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta was established [27] [466] [467] Advaita Vedanta's position as most influential Hindu darsana took shape as Advaitins in the Vijayanagara Empire competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their sect [472] Sringeri matha started to receive patronage from the kings of the Vijayanagara Empire [284] [27] [468] [466] who shifted their allegiance from Advaitic Agamic Shaivism to Brahmanical Advaita orthodoxy [495]\n\n\nModern Advaita\nMichael S Allen has written on the influence and popularity of Advaita Vedanta in early modern north India, especially on the work of the Advaita Dādū-panthī monk Niścaldās (ca 1791–1863), author of The Ocean of Inquiry (Hindi: Vichāra-sāgara), a vernacular compendium of Advaita [19] According to Allen, the work of Niścaldās \"was quite popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: it was translated into over eight languages and was once referred to by Vivekananda as having 'more influence in India than any  [book] that has been written in any language within the last three centuries.'\" [19]\n\n\nNiścaldās and \"Greater\" Advaita\nMichael S Allen has written on the influence and popularity of Advaita Vedanta in early modern north India, especially on the work of the Advaita Dādū-panthī monk Niścaldās (ca 1791–1863), author of The Ocean of Inquiry (Hindi: Vichāra-sāgara), a vernacular compendium of Advaita [19] According to Allen, the work of Niścaldās \"was quite popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: it was translated into over eight languages and was once referred to by Vivekananda as having 'more influence in India than any  [book] that has been written in any language within the last three centuries.'\" [19]\n\n\nNeo-Vedanta\nAccording to King, with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule the new rulers started to view Indians through the \"colonially crafted lenses\" of Orientalism In response Hindu nationalism emerged, striving for socio-political independence and countering the influence of Christian missionaries [504] Among the colonial era intelligentsia the monistic Advaita Vedānta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism, [505] with Hindu intellectuals formulating a \"humanistic, inclusivist\" response, now called Neo-Vedānta, attempting to respond to this colonial stereotyping of \"Indian culture  [as] backward, superstitious and inferior to the West.\" [506]\n\n\nContemporary Advaita Vedānta\nContemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), Chinmayananda Saraswati (1916-1993), [web 32] Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya) (1930-2015), Swami Paramarthananda, Swami Tattvavidananda Sarasvati, Carol Whitfield (Radha), Sri Vasudevacharya (previously Michael Comans)  [web 32] and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru [web 32] According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in 20th century Advaita tradition are Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal, Sacchidānandendra Saraswati [web 33]\n\n\nInfluence on new religious movements\nAdvaita Vedānta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age as nondualism, where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience [516] Nonduality points to \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\" [web 34] It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, \"the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality\" [web 35]\n\n\nSee also\nसलिले एकस् द्रष्टा अद्वैतस् भवति एष ब्रह्मलोकस्\nसम्राट् ति ह एनम् उवाच अनुशशास याज्ञवल्क्यस्\nएषा अस्य परमा गतिस् एषास्य परमा

ancient India and is considered one of the most influential philosophies in the history of Hinduism. The term \"Advaita\" means \"non-dualism\" in Sanskrit, and \"Vedanta\" refers to the Upanishads, a collection of ancient Indian texts that form the basis of the philosophy. Advaita Vedanta is a philosophical system that seeks to understand the nature of reality and the self, and it is characterized by its non-dualistic view of the ultimate reality, which is considered to be a unified, all-encompassing reality that underlies all existence.\n\n**Etymology and nomenclature**\n\nThe word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words: \"a\" (non) and \"dvaita\" (duality). In the context of Advaita Vedanta, \"a\" is used in the sense of \"non-dual\" or \"without duality.\" The term \"Vedanta\" is derived from the words \"Veda\" (knowledge) and \"anta\" (end or goal).\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words: \"a\" (non) and \"dvaita\" (duality). In the context of Advaita Vedanta, \"a\" is used in the sense of \"non-dual\" or \"without duality.\"\n\n**Advaita Vedanta**\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is a school of philosophical thought that emerged in ancient India and is considered one of the most influential philosophies in the history of Hinduism. The philosophy is based on the teachings of the Upanishads, a collection of ancient Indian texts that form the basis of the philosophy. The core idea of Advaita Vedanta is that the ultimate reality is a unified, all-encompassing reality that underlies all existence, and that this reality is the ultimate truth, which is beyond human comprehension.\n\n**Advaita in a broader sense**\n\nThe term \"Advaita\" is used in a broader sense to refer to a current of thought and practice that incorporates Advaitic elements with yogic thought and other strands of Indian religiosity. This broader current of thought and practice has also been called \"greater Advaita Vedanta\" or \"vernacular Advaita.\"\n\n**Non-dualism**\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is a non-dualistic philosophy, which means that it rejects the idea of a separate, independent self or individual ego. Instead, it posits that the self is ultimately one with the ultimate reality. This non-dualism is not to be confused with the idea of a conflation into one, but rather a negation of difference.\n\n**Darśana (view) - central concerns**\n\nVedānta is one of the six classical Hindu darśanas, the Indian traditions of religious philosophy and practice that accept the authority of the Vedas. The various schools of Vedanta aim to harmonize the diverging views presented in the Prasthantrayi, the Principal Upanishads, along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita, offering an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices that aim at the attainment of moksha, release or liberation from transmigratory existence.\n\n**Rejection of samkhya-dualism**\n\nAdvaita Vedanta rejects the idea of dualism, which it sees as a negation of the ultimate reality. Samkhya, a dualistic system, is seen as a limitation of the ultimate reality, and Advaita Vedanta seeks to transcend this limitation.\n\n**Theoretical difficulties**\n\nAdvaita Vedanta raises several theoretical difficulties, such as how the universe became manifold, how consciousness created the material world, and why suffering arose. The Brahma Sutras do not provide answers to these questions, and later Vedantins, including Shankara, had to resolve them.\n\n**Relationship between jivatman and Atman/Brahman**\n\nA main question in all schools of Vedanta is the relationship between the individual self (jiva) and Atman/Brahman. Shankara and his followers regard Atman/Brahman as the ultimate Real, jivanatman is \"ultimately of the nature of Atman/Brahman.\" This truth is established from a literal reading of selected parts of the oldest Principal Upanishads and Brahma Sutras.\n\n**Reality and ignorance**\n\nClassical Advaita Vedanta states that all reality and everything in the experienced world has its root in Brahman, which is unchanging intelligent Consciousness. The knowing self has various experiences of reality during the waking, dream, and dreamless states, and Advaita Vedanta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective, there are numerous distinctions.\n\n**Three levels of Reality/truth**\n\nShankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion.\n\n**Pāramārthika - Sat (True Reality)**\n\nPāramārthika is the highest level of reality, which transcends the other two levels.\n\n**Vyāvahārika (conventional reality)**\n\nVyāvahārika is the level of everyday experience, where we see the world as it appears to us.\n\n**Prāthibhasika (ideal reality)**\n\nPrāthibhasika is the level of experience during dreaming.\n\n**Turiya**\n\nTuriya is the fourth level of consciousness, which is beyond the other

spiritual traditions.\n\n**References**\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is a school of philosophical thought that emerged in ancient India and is considered one of the most influential philosophies in the history of Hinduism.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Advaita_Vedanta\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology and nomenclature\nThe word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words:\n\n\nAdvaita Vedanta\nWhile \"a preferred terminology\" for Upanisadic philosophy \"in the early periods, before the time of Shankara\" was Puruṣavāda, [47] [note 12] the Advaita Vedānta school has historically been referred to by various names, such as Advaita-vada (speaker of Advaita), Abheda-darshana (view of non-difference), Dvaita-vada-pratisedha (denial of dual distinctions), and Kevala-dvaita (non-dualism of the isolated) [48] It is also called māyāvāda by Vaishnava opponents, akin to Madhyamaka Buddhism, due to their insistence that phenomena ultimately lack an inherent essence or reality, [49] [50] [51] [52]\n\n\nAdvaita tradition\nWhile the term \"Advaita Vedanta\" in a strict sense may refer to the scholastic tradition of textual exegesis established by Shankara, \"advaita\" in a broader sense may refer to a broad current of advaitic thought, which incorporates advaitic elements with yogic thought and practice and other strands of Indian religiosity, such as Kashmir Shaivism and the Nath tradition [57] The first connotation has also been called \"Classical Advaita\" [26] [58] and \"doctrinal Advaita,\" [59] and its presentation as such is due to mediaeval doxographies, [39] the influence of Orientalist Indologists like Paul Deussen, [60] and the Indian response to colonial influences, dubbed neo-Vedanta by Paul Hacker, who regarded it as a deviation from \"traditional\" Advaita Vedanta [26] Yet, post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta incorporated yogic elements, such as the Yoga Vasistha, and influenced other Indian traditions, and neo-Vedanta is based on this broader strand of Indian thought [26] This broader current of thought and practice has also been called \"greater Advaita Vedanta,\" [19] \"vernacular advaita,\" [26] and \"experiential Advaita.\" [59] It is this broader advaitic tradition which is commonly presented as \"Advaita Vedanta,\" though the term \"advaitic\" may be more apt [26] [note 15]\n\n\nMonism\nThe nondualism of Advaita Vedānta is often regarded as an idealist monism [note 2] According to King, Advaita Vedānta developed \"to its ultimate extreme\" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads [note 16] In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedānta \"monistic,\" since this confuses the \"negation of difference\" with \"conflation into one.\" [61] Advaita is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the \"negation of a difference,\" between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived  [61]\n\n\nDarśana (view) – central concerns\nVedānta is one of the six classical Hindu darśanas, the Indian traditions of religious philosophy and practice which accept the authority of the Vedas The various schools of Vedanta aim to harmonise the diverging views presented in the Prasthantrayi, the Principal Upanishads, [65] [66] along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gitā, offering an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices which aim at the attainment of moksha, release or liberation from transmigratory existence [67] [68] [note 17]\n\n\nRejection of samkhya-dualism\n\"Samkhya is not one of the systems of Indian philosophy Samkhya is the philosophy of India!\"\n\n\nTheoretical difficulties\nBy accepting that Brahman is the sole reality, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedānta traditions offer different answers for: [76] [73] [74] First, how did Brahman, which is sat ('existence'), without any distinction, become manifold material universe? Second, how did Brahman, which is cit ('consciousness'), create the material world? Third, if Brahman is ananda ('bliss'), why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? The Brahma Sutras do not answer these philosophical queries, and later Vedantins including Shankara had to resolve them [76]\n\n\nRelation between jivatman and Atman/Brahman\nA main question in all schools of Vedanta is the relation between the individual self (jiva) and Atman/Brahman [80] As Shankara and his followers regard Atman/Brahman to be the ultimate Real, jivanatman is \"ultimately  [to be] of the nature of Atman/Brahman.\" [73] [4] This truth is established from a literal reading of selected parts [81] of the oldest Principal Upanishads and Brahma Sutras, and is also found in parts of the Bhagavad Gitā and numerous other Hindu texts, [2] and is regarded to be self-evident [82] [note 18] Great effort is made to show the correctness of this reading, and its compatibility with reason and experience, by criticizing other systems of thought [82] Vidya, correct knowledge or understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman, destroys or makes null avidya ('false knowledge'), and results in liberation [84] [note 19]\n\n\nReality and ignorance\nClassical Advaita Vedānta states that all reality and everything in the experienced world has its root in Brahman, which is unchanging intelligent Consciousness [2] To Advaitins, there is no duality between a Creator and the created universe [2] [85] All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness are somehow also this one fundamental reality Brahman [2] Yet, the knowing self has various experiences of reality during the waking, dream and dreamless states, [86] and Advaita Vedānta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions [87] Advaita explains this by postulating different levels of reality, [88] [89] [90] [86] and by its theory of errors (anirvacaniya khyati) [91] [2]\n\n\nThree levels of Reality/truth\nShankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion: [88] [89] [90]\n\n\nPāramārthika - Sat (True Reality)\nĀtman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is the \"real self\" [101] [102] [103] [104] [note 21] or \"essence\" [web 5] [note 22] of the individual It is caitanya, Pure Consciousness, [105] a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (svaprakashata),\" [104] and, states Payne, \"in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging.\" [note 22] It is self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual [106] It is \"a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality.\" [107] Ātman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness [108] According to Ram-Prasad, \"it\" is not an object, but \"the irreducible essence of being  [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.\" [109]\n\n\nĀtman\nĀtman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is the \"real self\" [101] [102] [103] [104] [note 21] or \"essence\" [web 5] [note 22] of the individual It is caitanya, Pure Consciousness, [105] a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (svaprakashata),\" [104] and, states Payne, \"in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging.\" [note 22] It is self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual [106] It is \"a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality.\" [107] Ātman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness [108] According to Ram-Prasad, \"it\" is not an object, but \"the irreducible essence of being  [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.\" [109]\n\n\nThree states of consciousness and Turiya\nAdvaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings, [117] [118] and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine: [119]\n\n\nSvayam prakāśa (self-luminosity)\nBrahma Jnanavali Mala, attributed to Adi Shankara: [web 8]\n\n\nBrahman\nAccording to Advaita Vedānta, Brahman is the true Self, consciousness, awareness, intelligent, possesed with will, and the only Reality (Sat) [136] [137] [138] [note 26] Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, \"Absolute Truth\" [139] or absolute Real [140] It is That which is unborn and unchanging, [137] [141] and immortal [note 7] Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya Brahman is \"not sublatable\", [136] which means it cannot be superseded by a still higher reality: [142]\n\n\nVyāvahārika (conventional reality) – Avidya and Māyā\nAvidyā is a central tenet of Shankara's Advaita, and became the main target of Ramanuja's criticism of Shankara [156] [157] In Shankara's view, avidyā is adhyasa, \"the superimposition of the qualities of one thing upon another.\" [158] As Shankara explains in the Adhyasa-bhasya, the introduction to the Brahmasutrabhasya:\n\n\nAvidyā (ignorance)\nAvidyā is a central tenet of Shankara's Advaita, and became the main target of Ramanuja's criticism of Shankara [156] [157] In Shankara's view, avidyā is adhyasa, \"the superimposition of the qualities of one thing upon another.\" [158] As Shankara explains in the Adhyasa-bhasya, the introduction to the Brahmasutrabhasya:\n\n\nMāyā (appearance)\nIn Advaita Vedanta, the perceived empirical world, \"including people and other existence,\" is Māyā, \"appearance.\" [169] [170] Jiva, conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, and misunderstands and interprets the physical, changing world as the sole and final reality [169] Due to avidya, we take the phenomenal world to be the final reality, [web 10] while in Reality only Sat ( True Reality, Brahman) is Real and unchanging [171]\n\n\nFive koshas (sheaths)\nDue to avidya, atman is covered by koshas (sheaths or bodies), which hide man's true nature According to the Taittiriya Upanishad, the Atman is covered by five koshas, usually rendered \"sheath\" [173] They are often visualized like the layers of an onion [174] From gross to fine the five sheaths are:\n\n\nParinamavada and vivartavada - causality and change\nCause and effect are an important topic in all schools of Vedanta [note 33] Two sorts of causes are recognised, namely Nimitta kāraṇa, the efficient cause, that which causes the existence of the universe, and Upādāna kāraṇa, the material cause, that from which the matery of this universe comes [176] All schools of Vedānta agree that Brahman is both the material and the efficient cause, and all subscribe to the theory of Satkāryavāda, [web 12] which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause [8] [note 34]\n\n\nMoksha – liberating knowledge of Brahman\nThe soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge as being in essence (Atman), awareness or witness-consciousness, and complete understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman [14] Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is the attainment of Brahman, immortality, [181] and leads to moksha (liberation) from suffering [note 38] and samsara, the cycle of rebirth [14] This is stated by Shankara as follows:\n\n\nKnowledge is liberating\nThe soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge as being in essence (Atman), awareness or witness-consciousness, and complete understanding of the identity of jivan-ātman and Brahman [14] Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is the attainment of Brahman, immortality, [181] and leads to moksha (liberation) from suffering [note 38] and samsara, the cycle of rebirth [14] This is stated by Shankara as follows:\n\n\nAttaining vidyā (knowledge)\nAdvaita Vedānta regards the liberated state of being Atman-Brahman as one's true identity and inherent to being human According to Shankara and the Vivarana-school, no human action can 'produce' this liberated state, as it is what one already is [30] As Swami Vivekananda stated:\n\n\nPreparation: the fourfold qualities\nThe Advaita student has to develop the fourfold qualities, [193] or behavioral qualifications (Samanyasa, Sampattis, sādhana-catustaya): [194] [195] [196] [note 42] A student in Advaita Vedānta tradition is required to develop these four qualities:\n\n\nThe threefold practice: sravana (hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation)\nThe Advaita tradition teaches that correct knowledge, which destroys avidya, psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, [16] is obtained in jnanayoga through three stages of practice, [195] sravana (hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation) [34] This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: [191] [192]\n\n\nGuru\nAdvaita Vedānta school has traditionally had a high reverence for a Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality, though this is not mandatory [211] Reading of Vedic literature and reflection is the most essential practice [211] Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words \"such as Sastracaryopadesa (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and Vedāntacaryopadesa (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru\" [211] According to Comans, this reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization [212] Nevertheless, in the Bhamati-school the guru has a less essential role, as he can explain the teachings, but the student has to venture its further study [213]\n\n\nPramana (means of knowledge)\nIn classical Indian thought, pramana (means of knowledge) concerns questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired [215] [216] In contrast to other schools of Indian philosophy, early Vedanta paid little attention to pramana [217] The Brahmasutras are not concerned with pramana, and pratyaksa (sense-perception) and anumana (inference) refer there to sruti and smriti respectively [217] Shankara recognized the means of knowledge, [218] [note 45] but his thematic focus was upon metaphysics and soteriology, and he took for granted the pramanas [223] For Shankara, sabda is the only means of knowledge for attaining Brahman-jnana [224] According to Sengaku Mayeda, \"in no place in his works  [...] does he give any systematic account of them,\" [223] taking Atman-Brahman to be self-evident (svapramanaka) and self-established (svatahsiddha), and \"an investigation of the means of knowledge is of no use for the attainment of final release.\" [223]\n\n\nSamadhi\nThe Advaita tradition emphasizes that, since Brahman is ever-present, Brahman-knowledge is immediate and requires no 'action', that is, striving and effort, as articulated by Shankara; [29] yet, it also prescribes elaborate preparatory practice, including yogic samadhi, posing a paradox which is also recognized in other spiritual disciplines and traditions [231] [35] [note 10]\n\n\nAnubhava ('experience')\nThe role of anubhava, anubhuti (\"experience,\" \"intuition\" [235]) as \"experience\" in gaining Brahman-jnana is contested While neo-Vedanta claims a central position for anubhava as \"experience,\" Shankara himself regarded reliance on textual authority as sufficient for gaining Brahman-jnana, [236] [note 46] \"the intuition of Brahman,\" [235] and used anubhava interchangeably with pratipatta, \"understanding\" [237] Arvind Sharma argues that Shankara's own \"direct experience of the ultimate truth\" guided him in selecting \"those passages of the scriptures that resonate with this experience and will select them as the key with which to open previously closed, even forbidden, doors.\" [238] [note 47]\n\n\nAdhyaropa Apavada - imposition and negation\nSince Gaudapada, [243] who adopted the Buddhist four-cornered negation which negates any positive predicates of 'the Absolute', [244] [245] [note 48] a central method in Advaita Vedanta to express the inexpressable is the method called Adhyaropa Apavada [243] In this method, which was highly estimated by Satchidanandendra Saraswati, a property is imposed (adhyaropa) on Atman to convince one of its existence, whereafter the imposition is removed (apavada) to reveal the true nature of Atman as nondual and undefinable [247] In this method, \"That which cannot be expressed is expressed through false attribution and subsequent denial.\" [248] As Shankara writes, \"First let me bring them on the right path, and then I will gradually be able to bring them round to the final truth afterwards.\" [248] For example, Atman, the real \"I,\" is described as witness, giving \"it\"  an attribute to separate it from non-self Since this implies a duality between observer and observed, next the notion of \"witness\" is dropped, by showing that the Self cannot be seen and is beyond qualifications, and only that what is remains, without using any words: [web 18]\n\n\nThe Mahavyakas - the identity of Ātman and Brahman\nMoksha, liberation from suffering and rebirth and attaining immortality, is attained by disidentification from the body-mind complex and gaining self-knowledge as being in essence Atman, and attaining knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman [14] [181] According to Shankara, the individual Ātman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical [249] The real self is Sat, \"the Existent,\" that is, Atman-Brahman [250] [251] [note 1] Whereas the difference between Atman and non-Atman is deemed self-evident, knowledge of the identity of Atman and Brahman is revealed by the shruti, especially the Upanishadic statement tat tvam asi.\n\n\nMahavakyas\nAccording to Shankara, a large number of Upanishadic statements reveal the identity of Atman and Brahman In the Advaita Vedanta tradition, four of those statements, the Mahavakyas, which are taken literal, in contrast to other statements, have a special importance in revealing this identity [81] [252] They are:\n\n\nThat you are\nThe longest chapter of Shankara's Upadesasahasri, chapter 18, \"That Art Thou,\" is devoted to considerations on the insight \"I am ever-free, the existent\" (sat), and the identity expressed in Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7 in the mahavakya (great sentence) \"tat tvam asi\", \"that thou art.\" [264] [265] In this statement, according to Shankara, tat refers to 'Sat, [265] \"the Existent\" [256] [7] [266] [267] Existence, Being, [web 20] or Brahman, [268] the Real, the \"Root of the world,\" [265] [note 51] the true essence or root or origin of everything that exists [7] [266] [web 20] \"Tvam\" refers to one's real I, pratyagatman or inner Self, [269] the \"direct Witness within everything,\" [18] \"free from caste, family, and purifying ceremonies,\" [270] the essence, Atman, which the individual at the core is [271] [272] As Shankara states in the Upadesasahasri: \n\n\nDirect perception versus contemplation of the Mahavakyas\nIn the Upadesasahasri Shankara, Shankara is ambivalent on the need for meditation on the Upanishadic mahavakya He states that \"right knowledge arises at the moment of hearing,\" [31] and rejects prasamcaksa or prasamkhyana meditation, that is, meditation on the meaning of the sentences, and in Up.II.3 recommends parisamkhyana, [279] separating Atman from everything that is not Atman, that is, the sense-objects and sense-organs, and the pleasant and unpleasant things and merit and demerit connected with them [280] Yet, Shankara then concludes with declaring that only Atman exists, stating that \"all the sentences of the Upanishads concerning non-duality of Atman should be fully contemplated, should be contemplated.\" [281] As Mayeda states, \"how they  [prasamcaksa or prasamkhyana versus parisamkhyana] differ from each other in not known.\" [282]\n\n\nRenouncement of ritualism\nIn the Upadesasahasri Shankara discourages ritual worship such as oblations to Deva (God), because that assumes the Self within is different from Brahman [note 52] [note 53] The \"doctrine of difference\" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, \"he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman\" [295] [296] The false notion that Atman is different from Brahman [274] is connected with the novice's conviction that (Upadesasaharsi II.1.25)\n\n\nEthics\nSome claim, states Deutsch, \"that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character\" [304] However, Deutsch adds, ethics does have a firm place in this philosophy Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers \"an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary\" [304] [305] According to Advaita Vedānta, states Deutsch, there cannot be \"any absolute moral laws, principles or duties\", instead in its axiological view Atman is \"beyond good and evil\", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of \"distinctionless Oneness\" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman [306] Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own Self and another being's, good and just Karma [307]\n\n\nTexts\nThe Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gitā and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedānta tradition, lending authority to the doctrines about the identity of Atman and Brahman and their changeless nature [314] [315]\n\n\nPrasthanatrayi\nThe Vedānta tradition provides exegeses of the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavadgita, collectively called the Prasthanatrayi, literally, three sources [316] [314] [315]\n\n\nTextual authority\nThe Advaita Vedānta tradition considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its karma-kanda (ritual injunctions) [314] The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman-Brahman are found in the Upanishads, which Advaita Vedānta has regarded as \"errorless revealed truth.\" [314] Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories [314]\n\n\nOther texts\nA large number of texts are attributed to Shankara; of these texts, the Brahma Sutra Bhasya (commentary on the Brahma Sutras), the commentaries on the principal Upanishads, and the Upadesasahasri are considered genuine and stand out.\n\n\nSampradaya and Smarta tradition\nAdvaita Vedānta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation Philosophy and renunciation are closely related: [web 22]\n\n\nMonastic order - Mathas\nAdvaita Vedānta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation Philosophy and renunciation are closely related: [web 22]\n\n\nSmarta Tradition\nThe Smarta tradition of Hinduism is a synthesis of various strands of Indian religious thought and practice, which developed with the Hindu synthesis, dating back to the early first century CE [note 62] It is particularly found in south and west India, and revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit [342] [343] [344] Their worship practice is called Panchayatana puja [345] [342] The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee's preference [343] [346]\n\n\nBuddhist influences\nAdvaita Vedānta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism [351] [352] According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\" [351] Murti notices that \"the ultimate goal\" of Vedanta, Samkhya and Mahayana Buddhism is \"remarkably similar\"; while Advaita Vedanta postulates a \"foundational self,\" \"Mahayana Buddhism implicitly affirms the existence of a deep underlying reality behind all empirical manifestations in its conception of sunyata (the indeterminate, the void), or vijnapti-matrata (consciousness only), or tathata (thatness), or dharmata (noumenal reality).\" [134] According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism [353]\n\n\nSimilarities\nAdvaita Vedānta and

Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism [353]\n\n\nMahayana influences\nThe influence of Mahayana Buddhism on Advaita Vedānta has been significant [353] [354] Sharma points out that the early commentators on the Brahma Sutras were all realists, or pantheist realists He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th-6th centuries CE when Buddhist thought developing in the Yogacara school [355]\n\n\nDifferences from Buddhism\nThe Advaita Vedānta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on Atman, Anatta and Brahman [364] Yet, some Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's Tathāgatagarbha sūtras suggest self-like concepts, variously called Tathāgatagarbha or Buddha nature [365] [366] In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality [367] [368] Some scholars posit that the Tathāgatagarbha Sutras were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists [369] [370] [371]\n\n\nCriticisms of concurring Hindu schools\nSome Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its Maya and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism [381] [353] sometimes referring to the Advaita-tradition as Māyāvāda [382]\n\n\nRelationship with other forms of Vedānta\nThe Advaita Vedānta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedānta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism) of Ramanuja, and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya [384] Their application of Vedanta philosophy to ground their faith turned Vedanta into a major factor in India's religious landscape [385]\n\n\nVishishtadvaita\nRamanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedānta schools, [386] [387] both are premised on the assumption that all Selfs can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedānta believed that some Selfs are eternally doomed and damned [388] [389] Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence [390] [391] Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (Self) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the nirguna Brahman [387] [392] [393] In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and saguna Brahman with attributes is also real [391] God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God's body [386] The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (saguna Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with nirguna Brahman [386] [390] [391]\n\n\nShuddhadvaita\nVallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world [394] That is why shuddhadvaita is known as 'Unmodified transformation' or 'Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda' Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the world Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a 'part' (but devoid of bliss) [395]\n\n\nDvaita\nMadhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Vedānta Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are identical (both in bondage and liberation [396]), there is interconnected oneness of all Selfs and Brahman, and there are no pluralities [397] [398] Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (Self) and Brahman are different (both in bondage and liberation [396]), only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual Selfs are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities [397] [398] Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedānta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought [399] Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including Upadhikhandana and Tattvadyota, primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita [399]\n\n\nInfluence on other traditions\nWithin the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, the ideas of Advaita Vedānta have had a major influence [note 67] Advaita Vedānta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India [400] One of its most popular text, the Bhagavata Purana, adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedānta philosophy [401] [402] [403] The Bhagavata Purana is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE [404] [405]\n\n\nHistory of Advaita Vedānta\nThe historiography of Advaita Vedanta is coloured by Orientalist notions, [418] [note 69] while modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta, which developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism [420] have \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought.\" [421] According to Michael S Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan, \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [422]\n\n\nHistoriography\nThe historiography of Advaita Vedanta is coloured by Orientalist notions, [418] [note 69] while modern formulations of Advaita Vedānta, which developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism [420] have \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought.\" [421] According to Michael S Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan, \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [422]\n\n\nEarly Vedānta\nThe Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedānta gives an interpretation [423] The Upanishads do not contain \"a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments\" [424] [note 70] This philosophical inquiry was performed by the darsanas, the various philosophical schools [426] [note 71]\n\n\nEarly Advaita Vedānta\nTwo Advaita writings predating Maṇḍana Miśra and Shankara were known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, namely the Vākyapadīya, written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century [20]), and the Māndūkya-kārikā written by Gauḍapāda (7th century) [21] Later scholarship added the Sannyasa Upanishads (first centuries CE [432]) to the earliest known corpus, some of which are of a sectarian nature, [433] and have a strong Advaita Vedānta outlook [434] [435] [436]\n\n\nGauḍapāda and Māṇḍukya Kārikā\nAccording to tradition, Gauḍapāda (6th century) [437] was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara Gauḍapāda wrote or compiled [438] the Māṇḍukya Kārikā, also known as the Gauḍapāda Kārikā or the Āgama Śāstra [439] The Māṇḍukya Kārikā is a commentary in verse form on the Māṇḍūkya Upanishad, one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedānta, the oldest surviving complete text is the Māṇḍukya Kārikā [440] The Māṇḍūkya Upanishad was considered to be a Śruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important [439] In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy The entire Karika became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era [441] [note 72]\n\n\nEarly medieval period - Maṇḍana Miśra and Adi Shankara\nMaṇḍana Miśra, an older contemporary of Shankara, [447] was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the Brahma-siddhi [448] [449] According to Fiordalis, he was influenced by the Yoga-tradition, and with that indirectly by Buddhism, given the strong influence of Buddhism on the Yoga-tradition [36] For a couple of centuries he seems to have been regarded as \"the most important representative of the Advaita position,\" [28] [284] [note 76] and the \"theory of error\" set forth in the Brahma-siddhi became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error [450]\n\n\nMaṇḍana Miśra\nMaṇḍana Miśra, an older contemporary of Shankara, [447] was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the Brahma-siddhi [448] [449] According to Fiordalis, he was influenced by the Yoga-tradition, and with that indirectly by Buddhism, given the strong influence of Buddhism on the Yoga-tradition [36] For a couple of centuries he seems to have been regarded as \"the most important representative of the Advaita position,\" [28] [284] [note 76] and the \"theory of error\" set forth in the Brahma-siddhi became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error [450]\n\n\nAdi Shankara\nVery little is known about Shankara According to Dalal, \"Hagiographical accounts of his life, the Śaṅkaravijayas (\"Conquests of Śaṅkara\"), were composed several centuries after his death,\" [web 17] in the 14th to 17th century, and established Shankara as a rallying symbol of values in a time when most of India was conquered by Muslims [27] He is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedānta school, but was actually a systematizer, not a founder [web 17] [451]\n\n\nSystematizer of Advaita thought\nShankara was a scholar who synthesized and systematized Advaita-vāda thought which already existed at his lifetime [451] According to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of the early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought \"were advocated by someone before Śankara\" [451] According to Nakamura, after the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedānta, culminating in the works of Gauḍapāda, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, [452] synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita [453] According to Koller, using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Vedānta in the 8th century, reforming Badarayana's Vedānta tradition [454] According to Mayeda, Shankara represents a turning point in the development of Vedānta, [452] yet he also notices that it is only since Deussens's praise that Shankara \"has usually been regarded as the greatest philosopher of India.\" [455] Mayeda further notes that Shankara was primarily concerned with moksha, \"and not with the establishment of a complete system of philosophy or theology,\" [455] following Potter, who qualifies Shankara as a \"speculative philosopher.\" [456] Lipner notes that Shankara's \"main literary approach was commentarial and hence perforce disjointed rather than procedurally systematic  [...] though a systematic philosophy can be derived from Samkara's thought.\" [457]\n\n\nWritings\nAdi Shankara is best known for his reviews and commentaries (Bhasyas) on ancient Indian texts His Brahmasutrabhasya (literally, commentary on Brahma Sutra) is a fundamental text of the Vedānta school of Hinduism [329] His commentaries on ten Mukhya (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars [329] [458] Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gitā (part of his Prasthana Trayi Bhasya) [239] He also authored Upadesasahasri, his most important original philosophical work [454] [459] The authenticity of Shankara being the author of Vivekacūḍāmaṇi [460] has been questioned, and \"modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara.\" [461]\n\n\nInfluence of Shankara\nWhile Shankara has an unparalleled status in the history of Advaita Vedanta, scholars have questioned the traditional narrative of Shankara's early influence in India [27] [28] [284] Until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Maṇḍana Miśra, who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita [28] [284] Only when Vacaspati Misra, an influential student of Maṇḍana Miśra, harmonised the teachings of Shankara with those of Maṇḍana Miśra, Shankara's teachings gained prominence [462] Some modern Advaitins argue that most of post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta actually deviates from Shankara, and that only his student Suresvara, who's had little influence, represents Shankara correctly [463] In this view, Shankara's influential student Padmapada misunderstood Shankara, while his views were manitained by the Suresvara school [463] According to Satchidanandendra Sarasvati, \"almost all the later Advaitins were influenced by Mandana Misra and Bhaskara.\" [464] [note 9] Until the 11th century, Vedanta itself was a peripheral school of thought; [465] Vedanta became a major influence when Vedanta philosophy was utilized by various sects of Hinduism to ground their doctrines, [385] such as Ramanuja (11th c.), who aligned bhakti, \"the major force in the religions of Hinduism,\" with philosophical thought, meanwhile rejecting Shankara's views [web 29]\n\n\nAdvaita Vedanta sub-schools\nTwo defunct schools are the Pancapadika and Istasiddhi, which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school [287] The still existing Bhāmatī and Vivarana developed in the 11th-14th century [web 30] [213] These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of māyā and avidya [web 30]\n\n\nLate medieval India\nMichael S Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studied, but \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedānta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" [422]\n\n\nVidyāraṇya\nIt is only during this period that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta was established [27] [466] [467] Advaita Vedanta's position as most influential Hindu darsana took shape as Advaitins in the Vijayanagara Empire competed for patronage from the royal court, and tried to convert others to their sect [472] Sringeri matha started to receive patronage from the kings of the Vijayanagara Empire [284] [27] [468] [466] who shifted their allegiance from Advaitic Agamic Shaivism to Brahmanical Advaita orthodoxy [495]\n\n\nModern Advaita\nMichael S Allen has written on the influence and popularity of Advaita Vedanta in early modern north India, especially on the work of the Advaita Dādū-panthī monk Niścaldās (ca 1791–1863), author of The Ocean of Inquiry (Hindi: Vichāra-sāgara), a vernacular compendium of Advaita [19] According to Allen, the work of Niścaldās \"was quite popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: it was translated into over eight languages and was once referred to by Vivekananda as having 'more influence in India than any  [book] that has been written in any language within the last three centuries.'\" [19]\n\n\nNiścaldās and \"Greater\" Advaita\nMichael S Allen has written on the influence and popularity of Advaita Vedanta in early modern north India, especially on the work of the Advaita Dādū-panthī monk Niścaldās (ca 1791–1863), author of The Ocean of Inquiry (Hindi: Vichāra-sāgara), a vernacular compendium of Advaita [19] According to Allen, the work of Niścaldās \"was quite popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: it was translated into over eight languages and was once referred to by Vivekananda as having 'more influence in India than any  [book] that has been written in any language within the last three centuries.'\" [19]\n\n\nNeo-Vedanta\nAccording to King, with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule the new rulers started to view Indians through the \"colonially crafted lenses\" of Orientalism In response Hindu nationalism emerged, striving for socio-political independence and countering the influence of Christian missionaries [504] Among the colonial era intelligentsia the monistic Advaita Vedānta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism, [505] with Hindu intellectuals formulating a \"humanistic, inclusivist\" response, now called Neo-Vedānta, attempting to respond to this colonial stereotyping of \"Indian culture  [as] backward, superstitious and inferior to the West.\" [506]\n\n\nContemporary Advaita Vedānta\nContemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), Chinmayananda Saraswati (1916-1993), [web 32] Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya) (1930-2015), Swami Paramarthananda, Swami Tattvavidananda Sarasvati, Carol Whitfield (Radha), Sri Vasudevacharya (previously Michael Comans)  [web 32] and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru [web 32] According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in 20th century Advaita tradition are Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal, Sacchidānandendra Saraswati [web 33]\n\n\nInfluence on new religious movements\nAdvaita Vedānta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age as nondualism, where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience [516] Nonduality points to \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\" [web 34] It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, \"the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality\" [web 35]\n\n\nSee also\nसलिले एकस् द्रष्टा अद्वैतस् भवति एष ब्रह्मलोकस्\nसम्राट् ति ह एनम् उवाच अनुशशास याज्ञवल्क्यस्\nएषा अस्य परमा गतिस् एषास्य परमा

Ukraine becoming parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and effectively removing all Soviet nuclear weapons from their soil, and that they agreed to the following:\n\n\nHistory\nWhen Ukraine became an independent state in December 1991, President Kravchuk signed agreements in Minsk and Almaty giving operational control over the nuclear forces on its territory to the new Commonwealth of Independent States based in Moscow [4] [13] [14] [importance?] [non-primary source needed] Until Ukraine transferred the Soviet nuclear weapons stationed on its soil, it held the world's third-largest nuclear weapons stockpile, [15] [16] of which Ukraine had physical but no effective operational control Russia controlled the codes needed to operate the nuclear weapons through electronic Permissive Action Links and the Russian command and control system, although this could not be a complete guarantee against Ukrainian access as the weapons could feasibly be manually accessed so Ukraine could eventually gain operational control over them [17] [18] [14] [importance?] [non-primary source needed]  Belarus only had mobile missile launchers, and Kazakhstan had chosen to quickly give up its nuclear warheads and missiles to Russia Ukraine went through a period of internal debate on their approach [4] [19]\n\n\nPreliminaries\nOn 23 May 1992, Russia, the U.S., Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine signed the Lisbon Protocol to the START I treaty, ahead of ratifying the treaty later The protocol committed Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to adhere to the NPT as non-nuclear weapons states as soon as possible However, the terms for the transfer of the nuclear warheads were not agreed, and some Ukrainian officials and parliamentarians started to discuss the possibility of retaining some of the modern Ukrainian built RT-23 (SS-24) missiles and Soviet built warheads [19] [20]\n\n\nThe Budapest Memoranda\nThe \"Budapest Memorandum\" is actually three documents signed individually on 5 December 1994 by the three leaders of the ex-Soviet nations, together with the guarantor nations: United States, United Kingdom and Russia So the UNTERM portal notes for one: \"To distinguish this from the other two Budapest Memorandums of the same date, this one could be referred to as the 'Budapest Memorandum regarding Kazakhstan'\" [22]\n\n\nSequels\nAfter this was agreed, the U.S used its Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction programme to provide financial assistance over $300 million (equivalent to $617 million in 2023), and technical assistance in decommissioning the nuclear weapons and delivery systems, which took to 2008 to fully complete [4] The U.S also doubled other economic aid to Ukraine to $310 million (equivalent to $637 million in 2023) for 1994 [23]\n\n\n2013 Belarus sanctions\nIn 2013, the government of Belarus complained that American sanctions against it were in breach of Article 3 of the Memorandum The US government responded that its sanctions were targeted at combating human rights violations and other illicit activities of the government of Belarus and not the population of Belarus [25]\n\n\n2014 Russian annexation of Crimea\nIn February 2014, Russian forces seized or blockaded various airports and other strategic sites throughout Crimea [26] The troops were attached to the Russian Black Sea Fleet stationed in Crimea, [27] which placed Russia in violation of the Budapest Memorandum The Russian Foreign Ministry had initially denied the movement of armoured units attached to the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea which led to the troops being labelled \"little green men\", [28] however after taking full military control over Crimea Russia finally did admit their involvement but asserted that they were acting within the scope of the various agreements between the two countries Russia responded by staging a so-called \"illegal referendum\" on whether the Crimea should join it, where the option to remain part of Ukraine and keep the same rights and laws of 2014, as before, was not present Prior to the referendum Russian military blocked all the opposition TV and media as well as radically put down the rallies for support of Ukraine There are cases where residents of Crimea were forced to vote under a gunpoint As a result, the Crimean parliament announced a referendum on Crimea's future in accordance with the law \"On the Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" On 16 March the referendum was held, on 17 March Crimea declared independence and on 21 March it was incorporated into the Russian Federation Ukraine vigorously protested the action as a violation of Article 1 of the Budapest Memorandum.\n\n\nKerch Strait incident\nOn 25 November 2018, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to transit from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol [42] [43]\nOn 27 November 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine appealed to the signatory states of the Budapest Memorandum to hold urgent consultations to ensure full compliance with the memorandum's commitments and the immediate cessation of Russian aggression against Ukraine [44] [45] [46]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nIn 2008 and 2011, Putin expressed the opinion that neither the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine nor the Budapest Memorandum signed by Yeltsin were binding for Russia In 2014, Putin claimed the Maidan movement and government change radically changed Ukraine into a new entity, toward which Russia has no engagement, allowing the 2014 invasion of Donbass [47]\n\n\nAnalysis\nUnder the agreement the Russian Federation provided security assurances to Ukraine in the form of promising neither to attack nor to threaten to attack them The other signatories (the United States, United Kingdom and France) pledged non-military support to Ukraine in exchange for its adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons The memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that Ukraine had already held from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) Final Act, the United Nations Charter and the Non-Proliferation Treaty [2] but the Ukrainian government found it valuable to have these

operational control over them [17] [18] [14] [importance?] [non-primary source needed]  Belarus only had mobile missile launchers, and Kazakhstan had chosen to quickly give up its nuclear warheads and missiles to Russia Ukraine went through a period of internal debate on their approach [4] [19]\n\n\nPreliminaries\nOn 23 May 1992, Russia, the U.S., Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine signed the Lisbon Protocol to the START I treaty, ahead of ratifying the treaty later The protocol committed Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to adhere to the NPT as non-nuclear weapons states as soon as possible However, the terms for the transfer of the nuclear warheads were not agreed, and some Ukrainian officials and parliamentarians started to discuss the possibility of retaining some of the modern Ukrainian built RT-23 (SS-24) missiles and Soviet built warheads [19] [20]\n\n\nThe Budapest Memoranda\nThe \"Budapest Memorandum\" is actually three documents signed individually on 5 December 1994 by the three leaders of the ex-Soviet nations, together with the guarantor nations: United States, United Kingdom and Russia So the UNTERM portal notes for one: \"To distinguish this from the other two Budapest Memorandums of the same date, this one could be referred to as the 'Budapest Memorandum regarding Kazakhstan'\" [22]\n\n\nSequels\nAfter this was agreed, the U.S used its Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction programme to provide financial assistance over $300 million (equivalent to $617 million in 2023), and technical assistance in decommissioning the nuclear weapons and delivery systems, which took to 2008 to fully complete [4] The U.S also doubled other economic aid to Ukraine to $310 million (equivalent to $637 million in 2023) for 1994 [23]\n\n\n2013 Belarus sanctions\nIn 2013, the government of Belarus complained that American sanctions against it were in breach of Article 3 of the Memorandum The US government responded that its sanctions were targeted at combating human rights violations and other illicit activities of the government of Belarus and not the population of Belarus [25]\n\n\n2014 Russian annexation of Crimea\nIn February 2014, Russian forces seized or blockaded various airports and other strategic sites throughout Crimea [26] The troops were attached to the Russian Black Sea Fleet stationed in Crimea, [27] which placed Russia in violation of the Budapest Memorandum The Russian Foreign Ministry had initially denied the movement of armoured units attached to the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea which led to the troops being labelled \"little green men\", [28] however after taking full military control over Crimea Russia finally did admit their involvement but asserted that they were acting within the scope of the various agreements between the two countries Russia responded by staging a so-called \"illegal referendum\" on whether the Crimea should join it, where the option to remain part of Ukraine and keep the same rights and laws of 2014, as before, was not present Prior to the referendum Russian military blocked all the opposition TV and media as well as radically put down the rallies for support of Ukraine There are cases where residents of Crimea were forced to vote under a gunpoint As a result, the Crimean parliament announced a referendum on Crimea's future in accordance with the law \"On the Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" On 16 March the referendum was held, on 17 March Crimea declared independence and on 21 March it was incorporated into the Russian Federation Ukraine vigorously protested the action as a violation of Article 1 of the Budapest Memorandum.\n\n\nKerch Strait incident\nOn 25 November 2018, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to transit from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol [42] [43]\nOn 27 November 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine appealed to the signatory states of the Budapest Memorandum to hold urgent consultations to ensure full compliance with the memorandum's commitments and the immediate cessation of Russian aggression against Ukraine [44] [45] [46]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nIn 2008 and 2011, Putin expressed the opinion that neither the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine nor the Budapest Memorandum signed by Yeltsin were binding for Russia In 2014, Putin claimed the Maidan movement and government change radically changed Ukraine into a new entity, toward which Russia has no engagement, allowing the 2014 invasion of Donbass [47]\n\n\nAnalysis\nUnder the agreement the Russian Federation provided security assurances to Ukraine in the form of promising neither to attack nor to threaten to attack them The other signatories (the United States, United Kingdom and France) pledged non-military support to Ukraine in exchange for its adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons The memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that Ukraine had already held from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) Final Act, the United Nations Charter and the Non-Proliferation Treaty [2] but the Ukrainian government found it valuable to have these assurances in a Ukraine-specific document [52]

[13] [14] Director Randal Kleiser had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm The Boy in the Plastic Bubble; Kleiser and Travolta developed a close platonic bond over the course of production, helping Travolta maintain focus as he grieved the death of Diana Hyland (his girlfriend at the time and his on-screen mother in Bubble) [13]  Before Newton-John was hired, Allan Carr was considering numerous names such as Carrie Fisher, [15] [16] Ann-Margret, Deborah Raffin, [17] Susan Dey and Marie Osmond for the lead role Fisher, who had recently finished Star Wars, was ultimately rejected because neither Stigwood nor Carr knew if she could sing [13] Osmond almost took the role before she realized the extent to which the character transformed into a rebel and turned it down [18] to star in Goin' Coconuts instead Carr eventually chose Newton-John after a chance encounter at a soireé hosted by Helen Reddy [19] Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's Funny Things Happen Down Under and the little-seen 1970 film Toomorrow, which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time; she requested a screen test prior to accepting the role [19] Newton-John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing and the ability to rewrite the script, which included changing her character's origin to an Australian immigrant (to avoid having to emulate an American accent) and making her less passive [19] In a case of life imitating art, Newton-John's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character; her next album after Grease, the provocatively titled Totally Hot, featured a much more sexual and pop-oriented approach, with Newton-John appearing on the album cover in similar all-leather attire and teased hair [20]\n\n\nFilming locations\nThe opening beach scene was shot at Malibu's Leo Carrillo State Beach, making explicit reference to From Here to Eternity The exterior Rydell scenes, including the front parking lot scenes, the auto shop, the “Summer Nights” bleachers number, Rizzo's “There Are Worse Things I Can Do” number, the basketball, baseball, and track segments, and the interior of the gymnastics gym, were shot at Venice High School in Venice, California, during the summer of 1977 The Rydell interiors, including the high school dance, were filmed at Huntington Park High School The sleepover was shot at a private house in East Hollywood The Paramount Pictures studio lot was the location of the scenes that involve Frosty Palace and the musical numbers \"Greased Lightning\" and \"Beauty School Dropout\" The drive-in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive-In (it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place) The race was filmed at the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, where many other films have been shot [25] The final scene where the carnival took place used John Marshall High School in Los Feliz [26] Furthermore, owing to budget cuts, a short scene was filmed at Hazard Park in Los Angeles.\n\n\nPost-production\nScenes inside the Frosty Palace contain obvious blurring of various Coca-Cola signs [27] Prior to the film's release, producer Allan Carr had made a product placement deal with Coca-Cola's main competitor Pepsi (for example, a Pepsi logo can be seen in the animated opening sequence animated by John David Wilson at Fine Arts Films [28]) When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged According to Kleiser, \"We just had to hope that Pepsi wouldn't complain They didn't.\" [29] [30]\n\n\nRelease\nGrease was originally released in the United States on June 16, 1978, and was an immediate box-office success In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at number 2 (behind Jaws 2) at the box office for the weekend [32] and with the all-time opening weekend records [33] Despite losing the opening weekend, it topped the box office the following weekend with a gross of $7,867,000 and set a record gross in its first 19 days, with $40,272,000 [34] [35] After 66 days, it had grossed $100 million to become Paramount's second-highest-grossing film, behind The Godfather, and ended its initial run with a gross of $132,472,560, [36] [37] which made it the highest-grossing film in 1978 [38]\n\n\nReception\nGrease is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978 [45] [46] [47] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [48] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 66% approval rating based on 156 reviews The website's critical consensus reads, \"Word is, Grease stars an electrifying John Travolta while serving up some '50s kitsch in a frenetic adaptation that isn't always the one that we want.\" [49]\n\n\nHome media\nGrease was released in the US on VHS by Paramount Home Video in 1979, 1982, 1989, 1992 and 1994;

however, Paramount confirmed these changes were done only for the film's advertising, [75] and the rating for the film itself changed from its original PG to that of PG-13 (as that rating had not been introduced until 1984) for \"sexual content including references, teen smoking and drinking, and language.\" [76] The film was shown for two weekends only;

[13] [14] Director Randal Kleiser had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm The Boy in the Plastic Bubble; Kleiser and Travolta developed a close platonic bond over the course of production, helping Travolta maintain focus as he grieved the death of Diana Hyland (his girlfriend at the time and his on-screen mother in Bubble) [13]  Before Newton-John was hired, Allan Carr was considering numerous names such as Carrie Fisher, [15] [16] Ann-Margret, Deborah Raffin, [17] Susan Dey and Marie Osmond for the lead role Fisher, who had recently finished Star Wars, was ultimately rejected because neither Stigwood nor Carr knew if she could sing [13] Osmond almost took the role before she realized the extent to which the character transformed into a rebel and turned it down [18] to star in Goin' Coconuts instead Carr eventually chose Newton-John after a chance encounter at a soireé hosted by Helen Reddy [19] Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only two film credits (1965's Funny Things Happen Down Under and the little-seen 1970 film Toomorrow, which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time; she requested a screen test prior to accepting the role [19] Newton-John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing and the ability to rewrite the script, which included changing her character's origin to an Australian immigrant (to avoid having to emulate an American accent) and making her less passive [19] In a case of life imitating art, Newton-John's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character; her next album after Grease, the provocatively titled Totally Hot, featured a much more sexual and pop-oriented approach, with Newton-John appearing on the album cover in similar all-leather attire and teased hair [20]\n\n\nFilming locations\nThe opening beach scene was shot at Malibu's Leo Carrillo State Beach, making explicit reference to From Here to Eternity The exterior Rydell scenes, including the front parking lot scenes, the auto shop, the “Summer Nights” bleachers number, Rizzo's “There Are Worse Things I Can Do” number, the basketball, baseball, and track segments, and the interior of the gymnastics gym, were shot at Venice High School in Venice, California, during the summer of 1977 The Rydell interiors, including the high school dance, were filmed at Huntington Park High School The sleepover was shot at a private house in East Hollywood The Paramount Pictures studio lot was the location of the scenes that involve Frosty Palace and the musical numbers \"Greased Lightning\" and \"Beauty School Dropout\" The drive-in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive-In (it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place) The race was filmed at the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, where many other films have been shot [25] The final scene where the carnival took place used John Marshall High School in Los Feliz [26] Furthermore, owing to budget cuts, a short scene was filmed at Hazard Park in Los Angeles.\n\n\nPost-production\nScenes inside the Frosty Palace contain obvious blurring of various Coca-Cola signs [27] Prior to the film's release, producer Allan Carr had made a product placement deal with Coca-Cola's main competitor Pepsi (for example, a Pepsi logo can be seen in the animated opening sequence animated by John David Wilson at Fine Arts Films [28]) When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged According to Kleiser, \"We just had to hope that Pepsi wouldn't complain They didn't.\" [29] [30]\n\n\nRelease\nGrease was originally released in the United States on June 16, 1978, and was an immediate box-office success In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at number 2 (behind Jaws 2) at the box office for the weekend [32] and with the all-time opening weekend records [33] Despite losing the opening weekend, it topped the box office the following weekend with a gross of $7,867,000 and set a record gross in its first 19 days, with $40,272,000 [34] [35] After 66 days, it had grossed $100 million to become Paramount's second-highest-grossing film, behind The Godfather, and ended its initial run with a gross of $132,472,560, [36] [37] which made it the highest-grossing film in 1978 [38]\n\n\nReception\nGrease is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978 [45] [46] [47] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [48] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 66% approval rating based on 156 reviews The website's critical consensus reads, \"Word is, Grease stars an electrifying John Travolta while serving up some '50s kitsch in a frenetic adaptation that isn't always the one that we want.\" [49]\n\n\nHome media\nGrease was released in the US on VHS by Paramount Home Video in 1979, 1982, 1989, 1992 and 1994; the last VHS release was on June 23, 1998, and was titled the 20th Anniversary Edition following a theatrical re-release that March [68] This one was THX certified and consisted of widescreen and pan and scan fullscreen versions [68]\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nGrease 2 (1982) stars Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer While several of the Rydell High staff characters reprise their roles, the sequel focused on the latest class of graduating seniors, hence most of the principals from Grease did not appear Patricia Birch, the original film's choreographer, directed the sequel The original musical's cocreator Jim Jacobs, who was not involved in the making of Grease 2, has disowned the film.\n\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nGrease 2 (1982) stars Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer While several of the Rydell High staff characters reprise their roles, the sequel focused on the latest class of graduating seniors, hence most of the principals from Grease did not appear Patricia Birch, the original film's choreographer, directed the sequel The original musical's cocreator Jim Jacobs, who was not involved in the making of Grease 2, has disowned the film.\n\n\nLegacy\nGrease 2 (1982) stars Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer While several of the Rydell High staff characters reprise their roles, the sequel focused on the latest class of graduating seniors, hence most of the principals from Grease did not appear Patricia Birch, the original film's choreographer, directed the sequel The original musical's cocreator Jim Jacobs, who was not involved in the making of Grease 2, has disowned the film.\n\n\nSequel\nGrease 2 (1982) stars Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer While several of the Rydell High staff characters reprise their roles, the sequel focused on the latest class of graduating seniors, hence most of the principals from Grease did not appear Patricia Birch, the original film's choreographer, directed the sequel The original musical's cocreator Jim Jacobs, who was not involved in the making of Grease 2, has disowned the film.\n\n\nSing-along version\n On July 8, 2010, a sing-along version of Grease was released to selected theaters around the U.S [74] A trailer was released in May 2010, with cigarettes digitally removed from certain scenes, implying heavy editing; however, Paramount confirmed these changes were done only for the film's advertising, [75] and the rating for the film itself changed from its original PG to that of PG-13 (as that rating had not been introduced until 1984) for \"sexual content including references, teen smoking and drinking, and language.\" [76] The film was shown for two weekends only; additional cities lobbied by fans from the Paramount official website started a week later and screened for one weekend [77] CBS aired this version of the film on June 7, 2020 [78]\n\n\nPrequel\nIn March 2019, it was announced that a prequel, called Summer Lovin', was in development from Paramount Players The project would be a joint-production collaboration with Temple Hill Productions and Picturestart John August signed on to serve as screenwriter [9] As of August 2024, there has been no further word on the project.\n\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack album ended 1978 as the second-best-selling album of the year in the United States, exceeded only by another soundtrack album, from the film Saturday Night Fever, which also starred Travolta [5] The song \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music – Original Song The song \"You're the One That I Want\" was released as a single prior to the film's release and became an immediate chart-topper, despite not being in the stage show or having been seen in the film at that time [79] Additionally, the dance number to \"You're the One That I Want\" was nominated for TV Land's award for \"Movie Dance Sequence You Reenacted in Your Living Room\" in 2008 [80] In the United Kingdom, the two Travolta/Newton-John duets, \"You're the One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights\", were both number one hits and as of 2018 [update] were still among the 30 best-selling singles of all time (at Nos 5 and 28, respectively) [81] The film's title song was also a number-one hit single for Frankie Valli [82]\n\n\nTelevision\nOn August 17, 2009, a television series inspired by the film premiered in Venezuela The series was produced and directed by Vladimir Perez The show explores and expands on the characters and story from the film [84] [85]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

was from Michigan [16] White's maternal grandfather was Greek, her paternal grandfather was Danish, both of her grandmothers were Canadians of English descent, and her other ancestry included Welsh [17] [18] [19] When she was one year old, her family moved to Alhambra, California, and later to Los Angeles during the Great Depression [20] [21] To make extra money, her father built crystal radios and sold them wherever he could Since it was the height of the Depression and hardly anyone had a sizable income, he would trade the radios for other goods, which sometimes included dogs [22]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter the war, White made the rounds to movie studios looking for work, but was turned down because she was \"not photogenic\" [31] She started to look for radio jobs, where being photogenic did not matter [31] Her first radio jobs included reading commercials and playing bit parts, and sometimes even doing crowd noises [31] She made about five dollars a show She would do just about anything, like singing on a show for no pay [14] She appeared on shows such as Blondie, The Great Gildersleeve, and This Is Your FBI She was then offered her own radio show, called The Betty White Show [32]\nIn 1949, she began appearing as co-host with Al Jarvis on his daily live television variety show Hollywood on Television, originally called Make Believe Ballroom, on KFWB and then on

control over the series, and was able to hire a female director [35] In a first for American network variety television, her show featured an African-American performer, [36] but the show faced

few women in television with full creative control in front of and behind the camera [33] The show was unusual for a sitcom in the 1950s because it was co-produced and owned by a twenty-eight-year-old woman who still lived with her parents White said they did not worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real-life situations that happened to her, Del Moore

I don't know how people can get so anti-something. Mind your own business, take care of your affairs, and don't worry about other people so much.\" In a 2011 interview, she revealed that she always knew her close friend Liberace was gay and that she sometimes accompanied him to premieres to help him hide it.\n\nDiscography\nIn September 2011, White teamed up with English singer Luciana to produce a remix of her song \"I'm Still Hot.\" The song was released digitally on September 22 and the video later premiered on October 6.

Oak Park, Illinois, on January 17, 1922 [11] She later clarified that \"Betty\" was her legal name and not a shortened version of \"Elizabeth\" as some people had assumed [12] [13] She was the only child of housewife Christine Tess (née Cachikis) and lighting company executive Horace Logan White [14] [15] Her father was from Michigan [16] White's maternal grandfather was Greek, her paternal grandfather was Danish, both of her grandmothers were Canadians of English descent, and her other ancestry included Welsh [17] [18] [19] When she was one year old, her family moved to Alhambra, California, and later to Los Angeles during the Great Depression [20] [21] To make extra money, her father built crystal radios and sold them wherever he could Since it was the height of the Depression and hardly anyone had a sizable income, he would trade the radios for other goods, which sometimes included dogs [22]\n\n\nCareer\nAfter the war, White made the rounds to movie studios looking for work, but was turned down because she was \"not photogenic\" [31] She started to look for radio jobs, where being photogenic did not matter [31] Her first radio jobs included reading commercials and playing bit parts, and sometimes even doing crowd noises [31] She made about five dollars a show She would do just about anything, like singing on a show for no pay [14] She appeared on shows such as Blondie, The Great Gildersleeve, and This Is Your FBI She was then offered her own radio show, called The Betty White Show [32]\nIn 1949, she began appearing as co-host with Al Jarvis on his daily live television variety show Hollywood on Television, originally called Make Believe Ballroom, on KFWB and then on KLAC-TV (now KCOP-TV) in Los Angeles [33] [29]\n\n\n1951–1969: Early career and breakthrough\nAfter the war, White made the rounds to movie studios looking for work, but was turned down because she was \"not photogenic\" [31] She started to look for radio jobs, where being photogenic did not matter [31] Her first radio jobs included reading commercials and playing bit parts, and sometimes even doing crowd noises [31] She made about five dollars a show She would do just about anything, like singing on a show for no pay [14] She appeared on shows such as Blondie, The Great Gildersleeve, and This Is Your FBI She was then offered her own radio show, called The

then on KLAC-TV (now KCOP-TV) in Los Angeles [33] [29]\n\n\nThe Betty White Show (1952–1954)\nFrom 1952 to 1954, White hosted and produced her own daily talk/variety show, The Betty White Show, first on KLAC-TV and then on NBC (her first television, but second show to feature that title) [33] Like her sitcom, she had creative control over the series, and was able to hire a female director [35] In a first for American network variety television, her show featured an African-American performer, [36] but the show faced criticism for the inclusion of tap dancer Arthur Duncan as a regular cast member The criticism followed when NBC expanded the show nationally Local Southern stations in the Jim Crow era threatened to boycott unless Duncan was removed from the series [37] In response, White said \"I'm sorry Live with it\", and gave Duncan more airtime [35] [38] Initially a ratings success, the show repeatedly changed time slots and suffered lower viewership By the end of the year, NBC quietly cancelled the series [39]\n\n\nLife with Elizabeth (1953–1955)\nIn 1952, the same year that she began hosting Hollywood on Television, White co-founded Bandy Productions with writer George Tibbles and Don Fedderson, a producer [33] The trio worked to create new shows using existing characters from sketches shown on Hollywood on Television White, Fedderson, and Tibbles created the television comedy Life with Elizabeth, with White portraying the title character [33] The show was originally a live production on KLAC-TV in 1951, and won White a Los Angeles Emmy Award in 1952 [33] [12] [29] [40] Life with Elizabeth was nationally syndicated from 1953 to 1955, allowing White to become one of the few women in television with full creative control in front of and behind the camera [33] The show was unusual for a sitcom in the 1950s because it was co-produced and owned by a twenty-eight-year-old woman who still lived with her parents White said they did not worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real-life situations that happened to her, Del Moore (who played Alvin), and the writer [14] White also performed in television advertisements seen on live television in Los Angeles, including a rendition of the \"Dr Ross Dog Food\" advertisement at KTLA during the 1950s She guest-starred on The Millionaire in the 1956 episode

{"title": "Israel", "content": "\nEtymology\nUnder the British Mandate (1920–1948), the entire region was known as Palestine [39] Upon establishment in 1948, the country formally adopted the name State of Israel (Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל, Medīnat Yisrā'elⓘ  [mediˈnat jisʁaˈʔel]; Arabic: دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل, Dawlat Isrāʼīl,  [dawlat ʔisraːˈʔiːl]) after other proposed names including Land of Israel (Eretz Israel), Ever (from ancestor Eber), Zion, and Judea, were considered but rejected [40] The name Israel was suggested by David Ben-Gurion and passed by a vote of 6–3 [41] In the early weeks after establishment, the government chose the term Israeli to denote a citizen of the Israeli state [42]\n\n\nHistory\nEarly hominin presence in the Levant, where Israel is located, dates back at least 1.5 million years based on the Ubeidiya prehistoric site [45] The Skhul and Qafzeh hominins, dating back 120,000 years, are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa [46] The Natufian culture, which may have been linked to Proto-Afroasiatic language, [47] [48] emerged by the 10th millennium BCE, [49] followed by the Ghassulian culture by around 4,500 BCE [50]\n\n\nPrehistory\nEarly hominin presence in the Levant, where Israel is located, dates back at least 1.5 million years based on the Ubeidiya prehistoric site [45] The Skhul and Qafzeh hominins, dating back 120,000 years, are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa [46] The Natufian culture, which may have been linked to Proto-Afroasiatic language, [47] [48] emerged by the 10th millennium BCE, [49] followed by the Ghassulian culture by around 4,500 BCE [50]\n\n\nBronze and Iron Ages\nEarly references to \"Canaanites\" and \"Canaan\" appear in Near Eastern and Egyptian texts (c 2000 BCE); these populations were structured as politically independent city-states [51] [52] During the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed vassal states of the New Kingdom of Egypt [53] As a result of the Late Bronze Age collapse, Canaan fell into chaos, and Egyptian control over the region collapsed [54] [55]\n\n\nClassical antiquity\nAfter capturing Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire, issued a proclamation allowing the exiled Judean population to return to Judah [81] [82] The construction of the Second Temple was completed c. 520 BCE [81] The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of Yehud Medinata [83] In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Achaemenid Empire After his death, the area was controlled by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires as a part of Coele-Syria Over the ensuing centuries, the Hellenization of the region led to cultural tensions that came to a head during the reign of Antiochus IV, giving rise to the Maccabean Revolt of 167 BCE The civil unrest weakened Seleucid rule, and in the late 2nd century the semi-autonomous Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea arose, eventually attaining full independence and expanding into neighboring regions [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nLate antiquity and the medieval period\nEarly Christianity displaced Roman paganism in the 4th century CE, with Constantine embracing and promoting the Christian religion and Theodosius I making it the state religion A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism, and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities [98] Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing diaspora communities, [99] while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion By the middle of the 5th century, there was a Christian majority [100] [101] Towards the end of the 5th century, Samaritan revolts erupted, continuing until the late 6th century and resulting in a large decrease in the Samaritan population [102] After the Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem and the short-lived Jewish revolt against Heraclius in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire reconsolidated control of the area in 628 [103]\n\n\nModern period and the emergence of Zionism\nIn 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of Ottoman Syria [110] Two violent incidents took place against Jews, the 1517 Safed attacks and the 1517 Hebron attacks, after the Turkish Ottomans ousted the Mamluks during the Ottoman–Mamluk War [111] [112] Under the Ottoman Empire, the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan, with religious freedoms for Christians, Muslims, and Jews In 1561 the Ottoman sultan invited Sephardi Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition to settle in and rebuild the city of Tiberias [113] [114]\n\n\nBritish Mandate for Palestine\nChaim Weizmann's efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the Balfour Declaration of 1917, [136] stating Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish \"national home\" in Palestine [137] [138] Weizmann's interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arabs Jewish-Arab relations in Palestine deteriorated dramatically in the following years [139]\n\n\nState of Israel\nOn 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel\" [174]  The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War; [175] contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan joined the war [176] [177] The purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state and to \"sweep them  [Jews] into the sea\" [166] [178] [179] The Arab League stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed [180]\n\n\nEstablishment and early years\nOn 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel\" [174]  The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War; [175] contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan joined the war [176] [177] The purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state and to \"sweep them  [Jews] into the sea\" [166] [178] [179] The Arab League stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed [180]\n\n\nArab–Israeli conflict\nDuring the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, [197] mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, [198] leading to several Israeli reprisal operations In 1956, the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal, which Egypt had nationalized The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with increasing fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population and recent Arab threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt [199] [200] [201] Israel joined a secret alliance with the UK and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula in the Suez Crisis but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights [202] [203] [204] The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration [205]\n\n\nPeace process\nThe 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin's Likud party took control from the Labor Party [227] Later that year, Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state [228] Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords (1978) and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty (1979) [229] In return, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip [229]\n\n\n21st century\nIn late 2000, after a controversial visit by Sharon to the Temple Mount, the Second Intifada began Palestinian suicide bombings were a recurrent feature [258] Some commentators contend that the intifada was pre-planned by Arafat after the collapse of peace talks [259] [260] [261] [262] Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 election; he carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the West Bank barrier, [263] ending the intifada [264] Between 2000 and 2008, 1,063 Israelis, 5,517 Palestinians and 64 foreign citizens were killed [265]\n\n\nGeography\nIsrael is located in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent At the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, it is bounded by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest It lies between latitudes 29° and 34° N, and longitudes 34° and 36° E.\n\n\nTectonics and seismicity\nThe Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system The DST forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate, while the Galilee, West Bank, Coastal Plain, and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly, for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 The deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of Mw ~7.4 [295]\n\n\nClimate\nTemperatures vary widely, especially during the winter Coastal areas, such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa, have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers The area of Beersheba and the northern Negev have a semi-arid climate with hot summers, cool winters, and fewer rainy days The southern Negev and the Arabah areas have a desert climate with very hot, dry summers, and mild winters with few days of rain The highest temperature of 54 °C (129 °F) was recorded in 1942 in the Tirat Zvi kibbutz [298] [299] Mountainous regions can be windy and cold, and areas at elevation of 750 metres (2,460 ft) or more (same elevation as Jerusalem) usually receive at least one snowfall each year [300] From May to September, rain is rare [301] [302]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nIsrael has a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister—usually this is the chair of the largest party The prime minister is the head of government and of cabinet [309] [310] The president is head of state, with limited and largely ceremonial duties [309]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts, known as mehozot (Hebrew: מחוזות; sg.: mahoz)—Center, Haifa, Jerusalem, North, South, and Tel Aviv, as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel Districts are divided into 15 sub-districts known as nafot (Hebrew: נפות; sg.: nafa), which are partitioned into 50 natural regions [324]\n\n\nIsraeli citizenship law\nThe two primary pieces of legislation relating to Israeli citizenship are the 1950 Law of Return and 1952 Citizenship Law The law of return grants Jews the unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel and obtain Israeli citizenship Individuals born within the country receive birthright citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen [327] Israeli law defines Jewish nationality as distinct from Israeli nationality, and the Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that an Israeli nationality does not exist [328] [329] A Jewish national is defined as any person practicing Judaism and their descendants [328] Legislation has defined Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people since 2018 [330]\n\n\nIsraeli-occupied territories\nIn 1967, as a result of the Six-Day War, Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty [229] Between 1982 and 2000, Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon, in what was known as the Security Belt Since capture of these territories, Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them, except Lebanon.\n\n\nInternational opinion\nThe International Court of Justice said, in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the West Bank barrier, that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory and found that the construction of the wall within the occupied Palestinian territory violates international law [349] Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242, which emphasizes \"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\", and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states (\"Land for peace\") [350] [351] [352] Israel has been criticized for engaging in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories, including occupation [353] and war crimes against civilians [354] [355] [356] [357] The allegations include violations of international humanitarian law [358] by the UN Human Rights Council [359] The U.S State Department has called reports of abuses of significant human rights of Palestinians \"credible\" both within Israel [360] and the occupied territories [361] Amnesty International and other NGOs have documented mass arbitrary arrests, torture, unlawful killings, systemic abuses and impunity [362] [363] [364] [365] in tandem with a denial of the right to Palestinian self-determination [366] [367] [368] [369] [370] Prime Minister Netanyahu has defended the country's security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists [371] and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by \"criminal killers\" [372]\n\n\nApartheid\nTreatment of Palestinians within the occupied territories and to a lesser extent in Israel itself have drawn widespread accusations that it is guilty of apartheid, a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [380] [381] The Washington Post's 2021 survey of scholars and academic experts on the Middle East found an increase from 59% to 65% of these scholars describing Israel as a \"one-state reality akin to apartheid\" [382] [383] The claim that Israel's policies for Palestinians within Israel amount to apartheid has been affirmed by Israeli human rights organization B'tselem and international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch [381] [384] Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din has also accused Israel of apartheid [384] Amnesty's claim was criticised by politicians and representatives from Israel and its closest allies such as, the US, [385] the UK, [386] the European Commission, [387] Australia, [388] Netherlands [389] and Germany, [390] while said accusations were welcomed by Palestinians [391] and the Arab League [392] In 2022, Michael Lynk, a Canadian law professor appointed by the U.N Human Rights Council said that the situation met the legal definition of apartheid, and concluded: \"Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world\" [393] [394] Subsequent reports from his successor, Francesca Albanese and from Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict chair Navi Pillay echoed the opinion [395] [396]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIsrael maintains diplomatic relations with 165 UN member states, as well as with the Holy See, Kosovo, the Cook Islands and Niue It has 107 diplomatic missions; [404] countries with which it has no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries [405] Six out of 22 nations in the Arab League have normalized relations with Israel Israel remains formally in a state of war with Syria, a status that dates back uninterrupted to 1948 It has been in a similarly formal state of war with Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 2000, with the Israel–Lebanon border remaining unagreed by treaty.\n\n\nForeign aid\nIsrael has a history of providing emergency foreign aid and humanitarian response to disasters across the world [434] In 1955 Israel began its foreign aid programme in Burma The programme's focus subsequently shifted to Africa [435] Israel's humanitarian efforts officially began in 1957 with the establishment of Mashav, the Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation [436] In this early period, whilst Israel's aid represented only a small percentage of total aid to Africa, its programme was effective in creating goodwill; however, following the 1967 war relations soured [437] Israel's foreign aid programme subsequently shifted its focus to Latin America [435]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is the sole military wing of the Israeli security forces and is headed by its Chief of the General Staff, the Ramatkal, subordinate to the Cabinet The IDF consists of the army, air force and navy It was founded during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War by consolidating paramilitary organizations—chiefly the Haganah [448] The IDF also draws upon the resources of the Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) [449] The IDF have been involved in several major wars and border conflicts, making it one of the most battle-trained armed forces in the world [450]\n\n\nLegal system\nIsrael has a three-tier court system At the lowest level are magistrate courts, situated in most cities across the country Above them are district courts, serving as both appellate courts and courts of first instance; they are situated in five of Israel's six districts The third and highest tier is the Supreme Court, located in Jerusalem; it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the High Court of Justice In the latter role, the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, allowing individuals, both citizens and non-citizens, to petition against the decisions of state authorities [477]\n\n\nEconomy\nIsrael is considered the most advanced country in West Asia and the Middle East in economic and industrial development [482] [483] As of October 2023 [update], the IMF estimated its GDP at 521.7 billion dollars and GDP per capita at 53.2 thousand (ranking 13th worldwide) [484] It is the third richest country in Asia by nominal per capita income  [485] and has the highest average wealth per adult in the Middle East [486]The Economist ranked Israel as the 4th most successful economy among the developed countries for 2022 [487] It has the most billionaires in the Middle East and the 18th most in the world [488] In recent years Israel had one of the highest growth rates in the developed world [489] In 2010, it joined the OECD [490] [491] The country is ranked 20th in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report [492] and 35th on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index [493] Economic data covers the economic territory of Israel, including the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank [334]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIsrael's development of cutting-edge technologies in software, communications and the life sciences have evoked comparisons with Silicon Valley [505] [506] Israel is first in the world in expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP [507] It is ranked 15th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, [508] and 5th in the 2019 Bloomberg Innovation Index [509] Israel has 140 scientists, technicians, and engineers per 10,000 employees, the highest number in the world [510] [511] and has produced six Nobel Prize-winning scientists, mostly in chemistry, since 2004 [512] and has been frequently ranked as one of the countries with the highest ratios of scientific papers per capita [513] [514] [515] Israeli universities are ranked among the top 50 world universities in computer science (Technion and Tel Aviv University), mathematics (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and chemistry (Weizmann Institute of Science) [516]\n\n\nEnergy\nIsrael began producing natural gas from its own offshore gas fields in 2004 In 2009 Tamar gas field was discovered near the coast, and Leviathan gas field was discovered in 2010 [536] The natural gas reserves in these two fields could make Israel energy-secure for more than 50 years Commercial production of natural gas from the Tamar field began in 2013, with over 7.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) produced annually [537] Israel had 199 billion bcm of proven reserves of natural gas as of 2016 [538] The Leviathan gas field started production in 2019 [539]\n\n\nTransport\nIsrael has 19,224 kilometres (11,945 mi) of paved roads [542] and 3 million motor vehicles [543] The number of motor vehicles per 1,000 persons is 365, relatively low among developed countries [543] The country aims to have 30% of vehicles on its roads powered by electricity by 2030 [544]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism, especially religious tourism, is an important industry, with beaches, archaeological, other historical and biblical sites, and unique geography also drawing tourists In 2017, a record 3.6 million tourists visited Israel, yielding a 25 percent growth since 2016 and contributed NIS 20 billion to the economy [549] [550]\n\n\nReal estate\nHousing prices are listed in the top third of all countries, [551] with an average of 150 salaries required to buy an apartment [552] As of 2022, there are about 2.7 million properties in Israel, with an annual increase of over 50,000 [553] However, the demand for housing exceeds supply, with a shortage of about 200,000 apartments as of 2021 [554] As a result, by 2021 housing prices rose by 5.6% [555] In 2021, Israelis took a record of NIS 116.1 billion in mortgages, an increase of 50% from 2020 [556]\n\n\nDemographics\nIsrael has the largest Jewish population in the world and is the only country where Jews are the majority [557] As of 31 May 2024 [update], the population was an estimated 9,907,100 In 2022, the government recorded 73.6% of the population as Jews, 21.1% as Arabs, and 5.3% as \"Others\" (non-Arab Christians and people who have no religion listed) [558] Over the last decade, large numbers of migrant workers from Romania, Thailand, China, Africa, and South America have settled in Israel Exact figures are unknown, as many of them are living in the country illegally, [559] but estimates run from 166,000 to 203,000 [560] By June 2012, approximately 60,000 African migrants had entered Israel [561]\n\n\nMajor urban areas\nIsrael has four major metropolitan areas: Gush Dan (Tel Aviv metropolitan area; population 3,854,000), Jerusalem (population 1,253,900), Haifa (924,400), and Beersheba (377,100) [586] The largest municipality, in population and area, is Jerusalem with 981,711 residents in an area of 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi) [587] Statistics on Jerusalem include the population and area of East Jerusalem, the status of which is in international dispute [588] Tel Aviv and Haifa rank as Israel's next most populous cities, with populations of 474,530 and 290,306, respectively [587] The (mainly Haredi) city of Bnei Brak is the most densely populated city in Israel and one of the 10 most densely populated cities in the world [589]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language is Hebrew Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken daily by the majority of the population Prior to 1948, opposition to Yiddish, the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews, was common among supporters of the Zionist movement, including the Yishuv, who sought to promote Hebrew's revival as a unifying national language [593] These sentiments were reflected in the early policies of the Israeli government, which largely banned Yiddish theatre performances and publications [594] Until 2018, Arabic was also an official language; [11] in 2018 it was downgraded to having a \"special status in the state\" [9] [10] Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority, with Arabic and Hebrew taught in Arab schools [595]\n\n\nReligion\nThe estimated religious affiliation as of 2022 was 73.5% Jewish, 18.1% Muslim, 1.9% Christian, 1.6% Druze, and 4.9% other [12] The religious affiliation of Israeli Jews varies widely: a 2016 survey by Pew Research indicates that 49% self-identify as Hiloni (secular), 29% as Masorti (traditional), 13% as Dati (religious) and 9% as Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) [605] Haredi Jews are expected to represent over 20% of the Jewish population by 2028 [606] Muslims constitute the largest religious minority, making up about 18.1% of the population About 1.9% of the population is Christian, and 1.6% is Druze [12] The Christian population comprises primarily Arab Christians and Aramean Christians but also includes post-Soviet immigrants, foreign laborers, and followers of Messianic Judaism, considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity [607] Members of many other religious groups,

capita (20 percent of the population) [618]\n\n\nCulture\nCultural diversity stems from its diverse population: Jews from various diaspora communities brought their cultural and religious traditions with them [631] Arab influences are present in many cultural spheres, [632] being found in architecture, [633] music, [634] and cuisine [635] Israel is the only country where life revolves around the Hebrew calendar Holidays are determined by the Jewish holidays The official day of rest is Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath [636]\n\n\nLiterature\nIsraeli literature is primarily poetry and prose written

matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library of Israel In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media [637] In 2016, 89 percent of the 7,300 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew [638]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nIsraeli music includes Mizrahi and Sephardic music, Hasidic melodies, Greek music, jazz, and pop rock [643] [644] The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra [645] [646] has been in operation for over seventy years and performs more than two hundred concerts each year [647] Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman and Ofra

the different streams in sculpture [659] [661] [662]\n\n\nArchitecture\nDue to the immigration of Jewish architects, architecture has come to reflect different styles In the early 20th century Jewish architects sought to combine Occidental and Oriental architecture producing buildings that showcase a myriad of infused styles [663] The eclectic style gave way to the modernist Bauhaus style with the influx of German Jewish architects (among them Erich Mendelsohn) fleeing Nazi persecution [664] [665] The White City of Tel Aviv is a UNESCO heritage site [666] Following independence, multiple

"**Israel**\n\n**Introduction**\nIsrael, officially known as the State of Israel, is a country located in the Middle East. It is the world's only Jewish-majority state, situated on a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. Israel is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest. The country has a diverse population, with Jews making up the majority, and a significant Arab minority.\n\n**Etymology**\nThe entire region was known as Palestine under the British Mandate from 1920 to 1948. Upon establishment in 1948, the country formally adopted the name State of Israel, after other proposed names, including Land of Israel (Eretz Israel), Ever (from ancestor Eber), Zion, and Judea, were considered but rejected. The name Israel was suggested by David Ben-Gurion and passed by a vote of 6-3.\n\n**History**\nThe earliest human presence in the Levant, where Israel is located, dates back at least 1.5 million years, based on the Ubeidiya prehistoric site. The Skhul and Qafzeh hominins, dating back 120,000 years, are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa. The Natufian culture, which may have been linked to Proto-Afroasiatic language, emerged by the 10th millennium BCE, followed by the Ghassulian culture by around 4,500 BCE.\n\n**Bronze and Iron Ages**\nThe earliest references to \"Canaanites\" and \"Canaan\" appear in Near Eastern and Egyptian texts (c 2000 BCE). During the Late Bronze Age (1550-1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed vassal states of the New Kingdom of Egypt. As a result of the Late Bronze Age collapse, Canaan fell into chaos, and Egyptian control over the region collapsed.\n\n**Classical Antiquity**\nAfter capturing Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire, issued a proclamation allowing the exiled Judean population to return to Judah. The construction of the Second Temple was completed c 520 BCE. The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of Yehud Medinata. In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Achaemenid Empire. After his death, the area was controlled by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires as a part of Coele-Syria.\n\n**Late Antiquity and the Medieval Period**\nEarly Christianity displaced Roman paganism in the 4th century CE, with Constantine embracing and promoting the Christian religion and Theodosius I making it the state religion. A series of laws were passed that discriminated against Jews and Judaism, and Jews were persecuted by both the church and the authorities. Many Jews had emigrated to flourishing diaspora communities, while locally there was both Christian immigration and local conversion.\n\n**Modern Period and the Emergence of Zionism**\nIn 1516, the Ottoman Empire conquered the region and ruled it as part of Ottoman Syria. Two violent incidents took place against Jews, the 1517 Safed attacks and the 1517 Hebron attacks, after the Turkish Ottomans ousted the Mamluks during the Ottoman-Mamluk War. Under the Ottoman Empire, the Levant was fairly cosmopolitan, with religious freedoms for Christians, Muslims, and Jews.\n\n**British Mandate for Palestine**\nChaim Weizmann's efforts to garner British support for the Zionist movement eventually secured the Balfour Declaration of 1917, stating Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish \"national home\" in Palestine. Weizmann's interpretation of the declaration was that negotiations on the future of the country were to happen directly between Britain and the Jews, excluding Arabs.\n\n**State of Israel**\nOn 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel.\" The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\n**Arab-Israeli Conflict**\nDuring the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, leading to several Israeli reprisal operations. In 1956, the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal, which Egypt had nationalized. The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with increasing fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population and recent Arab threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt.\n\n**Peace Process**\nThe 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin's Likud party took control from the Labor Party. Later that year, Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state. Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords (1978) and the Egypt-Israel peace treaty (1979).\n\n**21st Century**\nIn late 2000, after a controversial visit by Sharon to the Temple Mount, the Second Intifada began. Palestinian suicide bombings were a recurrent feature. Some commentators contend that the intifada was pre-planned by Arafat after the collapse of peace talks. Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 election; he carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the West Bank barrier, ending the intifada.\n\n**Government**\nIsrael has a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage. A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister—usually this is the chair of the largest party. The prime minister is the head of government and of cabinet. The president is head of state, with limited and largely ceremonial duties.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\nThe State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts, known as mehozot (Hebrew: מחוזות; sg.: mahoz)—Center, Haifa, Jerusalem, North, South, and Tel Aviv. All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel. Districts are divided into 15 sub-districts known as nafot (Hebrew: נפות; sg.: nafa), which are partitioned into 50 natural regions.\n\n**Israeli Citizenship Law**\nThe two primary pieces of legislation relating to Israeli citizenship are the 1950 Law of Return and 1952 Citizenship Law. The law of return grants Jews the unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel and obtain Israeli citizenship. Individuals born within the country receive birthright citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen. Israeli law defines Jewish nationality as distinct from Israeli nationality, and the Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that an Israeli nationality does not exist.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\nIsrael maintains diplomatic relations with 165 UN member states, as well as with the Holy See, Kosovo, the Cook Islands and Niue. It has 107 diplomatic missions. Countries with which it has no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries. Six out of 22 nations in the Arab League have normalized relations with Israel. Israel remains formally in a state of war with Syria, a status that dates back uninterrupted to 1948. It has been in a similarly formal state of war with Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 2000, with the Israel-Lebanon border remaining unagreed by treaty.\n\n**Economy**\nIsrael is considered the most advanced country in West Asia and the Middle East in economic and industrial development. As of October 2023, the IMF estimated its GDP at 521.7 billion dollars and GDP per capita at 53.2 thousand (ranking 13th worldwide). It is the third richest country in Asia by nominal per capita income. Israel has the highest average wealth per adult in the Middle East. The Economist ranked Israel as the 4th most successful economy among the developed countries for 2022. It has the most billionaires in the Middle East and the 18th most in the world. In recent years, Israel had one of the highest growth rates in the developed world. In 2010, it joined the OECD.\n\n**Science and Technology**\nIsrael's development of cutting-edge technologies in software, communications, and the life sciences have evoked comparisons with Silicon Valley. Israel is first in the world in expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP. It is ranked 15th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, and 5th in the 2019 Bloomberg Innovation Index. Israel has 140 scientists, technicians, and engineers per 10,000 employees, the highest number in the world. It has produced six Nobel Prize-winning scientists, mostly in chemistry, since 2004. Israeli universities are ranked among the top 50 world universities in computer science (Technion and Tel Aviv University), mathematics (Hebrew University of Jerusalem), and chemistry (Weizmann Institute of Science).\n\n**Energy**\nIsrael began producing natural gas from its own offshore gas fields in 2004. In 2009 the Tamar gas field was discovered near the coast, and the Leviathan gas field was discovered in 2010. The natural gas reserves in these two fields could make Israel energy-secure for more than 50 years. Commercial production of natural gas from the Tamar field began in 2013, with over 7.5 billion cubic meters produced annually. Israel had 199 billion cubic meters of proven reserves of natural gas as of 2016. The Leviathan gas field started production in 2019.\n\n**Transport**\nIsrael has 19,224 kilometers of paved roads and 3 million motor vehicles. The number of motor vehicles per 1,000 persons is 365, relatively low among developed countries. The country aims to have 30% of vehicles on its roads powered by electricity by 2030.\n\n**Tourism**\nTourism is an important industry, with beaches, archaeological, other historical and biblical sites, and unique geography also drawing tourists. In 2017, a record 3.6 million tourists visited Israel, yielding a 25 percent growth since 2016 and contributed NIS 20 billion to the economy.\n\n**Real Estate**\nHousing prices are listed in the top third of all countries. The average price of an apartment is 150 salaries. As of 2022, there are about 2.7 million properties in Israel, with an annual increase of over 50,000. However, the demand for housing exceeds supply, with a shortage of about 200,000 apartments as of 2021. As a result, housing prices rose by 5.6% in 2021. In 2021, Israelis took a record of NIS 116.1 billion in mortgages, an increase of 50% from 2020.\n\n**Demographics**\nIsrael has the largest Jewish population in the world and is the only country where Jews are the majority. As of 31 May 2024, the population was an estimated 9,907,100. In 2022, the government recorded 73.6% of the population as Jews, 21.1% as Arabs, and 5.3% as \"Others\" (non-Arab Christians and people who have no religion listed). Over the last decade, large numbers of migrant workers from Romania, Thailand, China, Africa, and South America have settled in Israel. Exact figures are unknown, as many of them are living in the country illegally, but estimates run from 166,000 to 203,000. By June 2012, approximately 60,000 African migrants had entered Israel.\n\n**Major Urban Areas**\nIsrael has four major metropolitan areas: Gush Dan (Tel Aviv metropolitan area; population 3,854,000), Jerusalem (population 1,253,900), Haifa (924,400), and Beersheba (377,100). The largest municipality, in population and area, is Jerusalem with 981,711 residents in an area of 125 square kilometers (48 square miles). Statistics on Jerusalem include the population and area of East Jerusalem, the status of which is in international dispute.\n\n**Language**\nThe official language is Hebrew. Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken daily by the majority of the population. Prior to 1948, opposition to Yiddish, the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews, was common among supporters of the Zionist movement, including the Yishuv, who sought to promote Hebrew's revival as a unifying national language. These sentiments were reflected in the early policies of the Israeli government, which largely banned Yiddish theatre performances and publications. Until 2018, Arabic was also an official language; in 2018 it was downgraded to having a \"special status in the state.\" Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority, with Arabic and Hebrew taught in Arab schools.\n\n**Religion**\nThe estimated religious affiliation as of 2022 was 73.5% Jewish, 18.1% Muslim, 1.9% Christian, 1.6% Druze, and 4.9% other. The religious affiliation of Israeli Jews varies widely. A 2016 survey by Pew Research indicates that 49% self-identify as Hiloni (secular), 29% as Masorti (traditional), 13% as Dati (religious) and 9% as Haredi (ultra-Orthodox). Haredi Jews are expected to represent over 20% of the Jewish population by 2028. Muslims constitute the largest religious minority, making up about 18.1% of the population. About 1.9% of the population is Christian, and 1.6% is Druze. The Christian population comprises primarily Arab Christians and Aramean Christians but also includes post-Soviet immigrants, foreign laborers, and followers of Messianic Judaism, considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity. Members of many other religious groups, including Buddhists and Hindus, maintain a presence in Israel, albeit in small numbers.\n\n**Education**\nEducation is highly valued and was viewed as a fundamental block of ancient Israelites. In 2015, the country ranked third among OECD members for the percentage of 25-64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 49% compared with the OECD average of 35%. In 2012, the country ranked third in the number of academic degrees per capita (20 percent of the population).\n\n**Culture**\nCultural diversity stems from its diverse population. Jews from various diaspora communities brought their cultural and religious traditions with them. Arab influences are present in many cultural spheres, being found in architecture, music, and cuisine. Israel is the only country where life revolves around the Hebrew calendar holidays are determined by the Jewish holidays. The official day of rest is Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.\n\n**Literature**\nIsraeli literature is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew, as part of the renaissance of Hebrew as a spoken language since the mid-19th century. A small body of literature is published in other languages. By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library of Israel. In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media. In 2016, 89 percent of the 7,300 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew.\n\n**Music and Dance**\nIsraeli music includes Mizrahi and Sephardic music, Hasidic melodies, Greek music, jazz, and pop rock. The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra has been in operation for over seventy years and performs more than two hundred concerts each year. Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, and Ofra Haza are among the internationally acclaimed musicians born in Israel.

Eilat has hosted its own international music festival, the Red Sea Jazz Festival, every summer since 1987. The nation's canonical folk songs are known as \"Songs of the Land of Israel\".\n\n**Cinema and Theatre**\nTen Israeli films have been final nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Palestinian Israeli filmmakers have made films dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict and status of Palestinians within Israel, such as Mohammed Bakri's 2002 film Jenin, Jenin and The Syrian Bride.\n\n**Arts**\nIsraeli Jewish art has been particularly influenced by the Kabbalah, the Talmud, and the Zohar.

Notable newspapers include the left-wing Haaretz, the centrist Yedioth Ahronoth, and the center-right Israel Hayom. There are several major TV channels that cater to different audiences, from Russian-language Channel 9 to Arabic-language Kan 33. The 2024 Freedom House report found Israeli media is \"vibrant and free to criticize government policy.\" In the 2024 Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, Israel was placed 101st of 180 countries, second in the Middle East and North Africa.

and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War; [175] contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan joined the war [176] [177] The purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state and to \"sweep them  [Jews] into the sea\" [166] [178] [179] The Arab League stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed [180]\n\n\nEstablishment and early years\nOn 14 May 1948, the day before the expiration of the British Mandate, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel\" [174]  The following day, the armies of four Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Transjordan and Iraq—entered what had been Mandatory Palestine, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War; [175] contingents from Yemen, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan joined the war [176] [177] The purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state and to \"sweep them  [Jews] into the sea\" [166] [178] [179] The Arab League stated the invasion was to restore order and prevent further bloodshed [180]\n\n\nArab–Israeli conflict\nDuring the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, [197] mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, [198] leading to several Israeli reprisal operations In 1956, the UK and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal, which Egypt had nationalized The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with increasing fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population and recent Arab threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt [199] [200] [201] Israel joined a secret alliance with the UK and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula in the Suez Crisis but was pressured to withdraw by the UN in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights [202] [203] [204] The war resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration [205]\n\n\nPeace process\nThe 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin's Likud party took control from the Labor Party [227] Later that year, Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state [228] Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords (1978) and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty (1979) [229] In return, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip [229]\n\n\n21st century\nIn late 2000, after a controversial visit by Sharon to the Temple Mount, the Second Intifada began Palestinian suicide bombings were a recurrent feature [258] Some commentators contend that the intifada was pre-planned by Arafat after the collapse of peace talks [259] [260] [261] [262] Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 election; he carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and spearheaded the construction of the West Bank barrier, [263] ending the intifada [264] Between 2000 and 2008, 1,063 Israelis, 5,517 Palestinians and 64 foreign citizens were killed [265]\n\n\nGeography\nIsrael is located in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent At the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, it is bounded by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank to the east, and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest It lies between latitudes 29° and 34° N, and longitudes 34° and 36° E.\n\n\nTectonics and seismicity\nThe Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system The DST forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate, while the Galilee, West Bank, Coastal Plain, and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly, for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 The deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of Mw ~7.4 [295]\n\n\nClimate\nTemperatures vary widely, especially during the winter Coastal areas, such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa, have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers The area of Beersheba and the northern Negev have a semi-arid climate with hot summers, cool winters, and fewer rainy days The southern Negev and the Arabah areas have a desert climate with very hot, dry summers, and mild winters with few days of rain The highest temperature of 54 °C (129 °F) was recorded in 1942 in the Tirat Zvi kibbutz [298] [299] Mountainous regions can be windy and cold, and areas at elevation of 750 metres (2,460 ft) or more (same elevation as Jerusalem) usually receive at least one snowfall each year [300] From May to September, rain is rare [301] [302]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nIsrael has a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister—usually this is the chair of the largest party The prime minister is the head of government and of cabinet [309] [310] The president is head of state, with limited and largely ceremonial duties [309]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts, known as mehozot (Hebrew: מחוזות; sg.: mahoz)—Center, Haifa, Jerusalem, North, South, and Tel Aviv, as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel Districts are divided into 15 sub-districts known as nafot (Hebrew: נפות; sg.: nafa), which are partitioned into 50 natural regions [324]\n\n\nIsraeli citizenship law\nThe two primary pieces of legislation relating to Israeli citizenship are the 1950 Law of Return and 1952 Citizenship Law The law of return grants Jews the unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel and obtain Israeli citizenship Individuals born within the country receive birthright citizenship if at least one parent is a citizen [327] Israeli law defines Jewish nationality as distinct from Israeli nationality, and the Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that an Israeli nationality does not exist [328] [329] A Jewish national is defined as any person practicing Judaism and their descendants [328] Legislation has defined Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people since 2018 [330]\n\n\nIsraeli-occupied territories\nIn 1967, as a result of the Six-Day War, Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty [229] Between 1982 and 2000, Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon, in what was known as the Security Belt Since capture of these territories, Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them, except Lebanon.\n\n\nInternational opinion\nThe International Court of Justice said, in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the West Bank barrier, that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory and found that the construction of the wall within the occupied Palestinian territory violates international law [349] Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242, which emphasizes \"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\", and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states (\"Land for peace\") [350] [351] [352] Israel has been criticized for engaging in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories, including occupation [353] and war crimes against civilians [354] [355] [356] [357] The allegations include violations of international humanitarian law [358] by the UN Human Rights Council [359] The U.S State Department has called reports of abuses of significant human rights of Palestinians \"credible\" both within Israel [360] and the occupied territories [361] Amnesty International and other NGOs have documented mass arbitrary arrests, torture, unlawful killings, systemic abuses and impunity [362] [363] [364] [365] in tandem with a denial of the right to Palestinian self-determination [366] [367] [368] [369] [370] Prime Minister Netanyahu has defended the country's security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists [371] and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by \"criminal killers\" [372]\n\n\nApartheid\nTreatment of Palestinians within the occupied territories and to a lesser extent in Israel itself have drawn widespread accusations that it is guilty of apartheid, a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [380] [381] The Washington Post's 2021 survey of scholars and academic experts on the Middle East found an increase from 59% to 65% of these scholars describing Israel as a \"one-state reality akin to apartheid\" [382] [383] The claim that Israel's policies for Palestinians within Israel amount to apartheid has been affirmed by Israeli human rights organization B'tselem and international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch [381] [384] Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din has also accused Israel of apartheid [384] Amnesty's claim was criticised by politicians and representatives from Israel and its closest allies such as, the US, [385] the UK, [386] the European Commission, [387] Australia, [388] Netherlands [389] and Germany, [390] while said accusations were welcomed by Palestinians [391] and the Arab League [392] In 2022, Michael Lynk, a Canadian law professor appointed by the U.N Human Rights Council said that the situation met the legal definition of apartheid, and concluded: \"Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world\" [393] [394] Subsequent reports from his successor, Francesca Albanese and from Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict chair Navi Pillay echoed the opinion [395] [396]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIsrael maintains diplomatic relations with 165 UN member states, as well as with the Holy See, Kosovo, the Cook Islands and Niue It has 107 diplomatic missions; [404] countries with which it has no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries [405] Six out of 22 nations in the Arab League have normalized relations with Israel Israel remains formally in a state of war with Syria, a status that dates back uninterrupted to 1948 It has been in a similarly formal state of war with Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 2000, with the Israel–Lebanon border remaining unagreed by treaty.\n\n\nForeign aid\nIsrael has a history of providing emergency foreign aid and humanitarian response to disasters across the world [434] In 1955 Israel began its foreign aid programme in Burma The programme's focus subsequently shifted to Africa [435] Israel's humanitarian efforts officially began in 1957 with the establishment of Mashav, the Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation [436] In this early period, whilst Israel's aid represented only a small percentage of total aid to Africa, its programme was effective in creating goodwill; however, following the 1967 war relations soured [437] Israel's foreign aid programme subsequently shifted its focus to Latin America [435]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is the sole military wing of the Israeli security forces and is headed by its Chief of the General Staff, the Ramatkal, subordinate to the Cabinet The IDF consists of the army, air force and navy It was founded during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War by consolidating paramilitary organizations—chiefly the Haganah [448] The IDF also draws upon the resources of the Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman) [449] The IDF have been involved in several major wars and border conflicts, making it one of the most battle-trained armed forces in the world [450]\n\n\nLegal system\nIsrael has a three-tier court system At the lowest level are magistrate courts, situated in most cities across the country Above them are district courts, serving as both appellate courts and courts of first instance; they are situated in five of Israel's six districts The third and highest tier is the Supreme Court, located in Jerusalem; it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the High Court of Justice In the latter role, the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, allowing individuals, both citizens and non-citizens, to petition against the decisions of state authorities [477]\n\n\nEconomy\nIsrael is considered the most advanced country in West Asia and the Middle East in economic and industrial development [482] [483] As of October 2023 [update], the IMF estimated its GDP at 521.7 billion dollars and GDP per capita at 53.2 thousand (ranking 13th worldwide) [484] It is the third richest country in Asia by nominal per capita income  [485] and has the highest average wealth per adult in the Middle East [486]The Economist ranked Israel as the 4th most successful economy among the developed countries for 2022 [487] It has the most billionaires in the Middle East and the 18th most in the world [488] In recent years Israel had one of the highest growth rates in the developed world [489] In 2010, it joined the OECD [490] [491] The country is ranked 20th in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report [492] and 35th on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index [493] Economic data covers the economic territory of Israel, including the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank [334]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIsrael's development of cutting-edge technologies in software, communications and the life sciences have evoked comparisons with Silicon Valley [505] [506] Israel is first in the world in expenditure on research and development as a percentage of GDP [507] It is ranked 15th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, [508] and 5th in the 2019 Bloomberg Innovation Index [509] Israel has 140 scientists, technicians, and engineers per 10,000 employees, the highest number in the world [510] [511] and has produced six Nobel Prize-winning scientists, mostly in chemistry, since 2004 [512] and has been frequently ranked as one of the countries with the highest ratios of scientific papers per capita [513] [514] [515] Israeli universities are ranked among the top 50 world universities in computer science (Technion and Tel Aviv University), mathematics (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and chemistry (Weizmann Institute of Science) [516]\n\n\nEnergy\nIsrael began producing natural gas from its own offshore gas fields in 2004 In 2009 Tamar gas field was discovered near the coast, and Leviathan gas field was discovered in 2010 [536] The natural gas reserves in these two fields could make Israel energy-secure for more than 50 years Commercial production of natural gas from the Tamar field began in 2013, with over 7.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) produced annually [537] Israel had 199 billion bcm of proven reserves of natural gas as of 2016 [538] The Leviathan gas field started production in 2019 [539]\n\n\nTransport\nIsrael has 19,224 kilometres (11,945 mi) of paved roads [542] and 3 million motor vehicles [543] The number of motor vehicles per 1,000 persons is 365, relatively low among developed countries [543] The country aims to have 30% of vehicles on its roads powered by electricity by 2030 [544]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism, especially religious tourism, is an important industry, with beaches, archaeological, other historical and biblical sites, and unique geography also drawing tourists In 2017, a record 3.6 million tourists visited Israel, yielding a 25 percent growth since 2016 and contributed NIS 20 billion to the economy [549] [550]\n\n\nReal estate\nHousing prices are listed in the top third of all countries, [551] with an average of 150 salaries required to buy an apartment [552] As of 2022, there are about 2.7 million properties in Israel, with an annual increase of over 50,000 [553] However, the demand for housing exceeds supply, with a shortage of about 200,000 apartments as of 2021 [554] As a result, by 2021 housing prices rose by 5.6% [555] In 2021, Israelis took a record of NIS 116.1 billion in mortgages, an increase of 50% from 2020 [556]\n\n\nDemographics\nIsrael has the largest Jewish population in the world and is the only country where Jews are the majority [557] As of 31 May 2024 [update], the population was an estimated 9,907,100 In 2022, the government recorded 73.6% of the population as Jews, 21.1% as Arabs, and 5.3% as \"Others\" (non-Arab Christians and people who have no religion listed) [558] Over the last decade, large numbers of migrant workers from Romania, Thailand, China, Africa, and South America have settled in Israel Exact figures are unknown, as many of them are living in the country illegally, [559] but estimates run from 166,000 to 203,000 [560] By June 2012, approximately 60,000 African migrants had entered Israel [561]\n\n\nMajor urban areas\nIsrael has four major metropolitan areas: Gush Dan (Tel Aviv metropolitan area; population 3,854,000), Jerusalem (population 1,253,900), Haifa (924,400), and Beersheba (377,100) [586] The largest municipality, in population and area, is Jerusalem with 981,711 residents in an area of 125 square kilometres (48 sq mi) [587] Statistics on Jerusalem include the population and area of East Jerusalem, the status of which is in international dispute [588] Tel Aviv and Haifa rank as Israel's next most populous cities, with populations of 474,530 and 290,306, respectively [587] The (mainly Haredi) city of Bnei Brak is the most densely populated city in Israel and one of the 10 most densely populated cities in the world [589]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language is Hebrew Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken daily by the majority of the population Prior to 1948, opposition to Yiddish, the historical language of the Ashkenazi Jews, was common among supporters of the Zionist movement, including the Yishuv, who sought to promote Hebrew's revival as a unifying national language [593] These sentiments were reflected in the early policies of the Israeli government, which largely banned Yiddish theatre performances and publications [594] Until 2018, Arabic was also an official language; [11] in 2018 it was downgraded to having a \"special status in the state\" [9] [10] Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority, with Arabic and Hebrew taught in Arab schools [595]\n\n\nReligion\nThe estimated religious affiliation as of 2022 was 73.5% Jewish, 18.1% Muslim, 1.9% Christian, 1.6% Druze, and 4.9% other [12] The religious affiliation of Israeli Jews varies widely: a 2016 survey by Pew Research indicates that 49% self-identify as Hiloni (secular), 29% as Masorti (traditional), 13% as Dati (religious) and 9% as Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) [605] Haredi Jews are expected to represent over 20% of the Jewish population by 2028 [606] Muslims constitute the largest religious minority, making up about 18.1% of the population About 1.9% of the population is Christian, and 1.6% is Druze [12] The Christian population comprises primarily Arab Christians and Aramean Christians but also includes post-Soviet immigrants, foreign laborers, and followers of Messianic Judaism, considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity [607] Members of many other religious groups, including Buddhists and Hindus, maintain a presence in Israel, albeit in small numbers [608] Out of over one million immigrants from the former Soviet Union, about 300,000 are considered not Jewish by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel [609]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation is highly valued and was viewed as a fundamental block of ancient Israelites [616] In 2015, the country ranked third among OECD members for the percentage of 25–64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 49% compared with the OECD average of 35% [617] In 2012, the country ranked third in the number of academic degrees per capita (20 percent of the population) [618]\n\n\nCulture\nCultural diversity stems from its diverse population: Jews from various diaspora communities brought their cultural and religious traditions with them [631] Arab influences are present in many cultural spheres, [632] being found in architecture, [633] music, [634] and cuisine [635] Israel is the only country where life revolves around the Hebrew calendar Holidays are determined by the Jewish holidays The official day of rest is Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath [636]\n\n\nLiterature\nIsraeli literature is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew, as part of the renaissance of Hebrew as a spoken language since the mid-19th century, although a small body of literature is published in other languages By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the National Library of Israel In 2001, the law was amended to include audio and video recordings, and other non-print media [637] In 2016, 89 percent of the 7,300 books transferred to the library were in Hebrew [638]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nIsraeli music includes Mizrahi and Sephardic music, Hasidic melodies, Greek music, jazz, and pop rock [643] [644] The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra [645] [646] has been in operation for over seventy years and performs more than two hundred concerts each year [647] Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman and Ofra Haza are among the internationally acclaimed musicians born in Israel Israel has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest nearly every year since 1973, winning the competition four times and hosting it twice [648] [649] Eilat has hosted its own international music festival, the Red Sea Jazz Festival, every summer since 1987 [650] The nation's canonical folk songs are known as \"Songs of the Land of Israel\" [651]\n\n\nCinema and theatre\nTen Israeli films have been final nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards Palestinian Israeli filmmakers have made films dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict and status of Palestinians within Israel, such as Mohammed Bakri's 2002 film Jenin, Jenin and The Syrian Bride.\n\n\nArts\nIsraeli Jewish art has been particularly influenced by the Kabbalah, the Talmud and the Zohar Another art movement that held a prominent role in the 20th century was the School of Paris In the late 19th and early 20th century, the Yishuv's art was dominated by art trends emanating Bezalel Beginning in the 1920s, the local art scene was heavily influenced by modern French art, first introduced by Isaac Frenkel Frenel [655] [656] Jewish masters of the school of Paris, such as Soutine, Kikoine, Frenkel, Chagall heavily influenced the subsequent development of Israeli art [657] [658] Israeli sculpture took inspiration from modern European sculpture as well Mesopotamian, Assyrian and local art [659] [660] Avraham Melnikov's roaring lion, David Polus' Alexander Zaid and Ze'ev Ben Zvi's cubist sculpture exemplify some of the different streams in sculpture [659] [661] [662]\n\n\nArchitecture\nDue to the immigration of Jewish architects, architecture has come to reflect different styles In the early 20th century Jewish architects sought to combine Occidental and Oriental architecture producing buildings that showcase a myriad of infused styles [663] The eclectic style gave way to the modernist Bauhaus style with the influx of German Jewish architects (among them Erich Mendelsohn) fleeing Nazi persecution [664] [665] The White City of Tel Aviv is a UNESCO heritage site [666] Following independence, multiple government projects were commissioned, a grand part built in a brutalist style with heavy emphasis on the use of concrete and acclimatization to the desert climate [667] [668]\n\n\nMedia\nMedia is diverse, reflecting the spectrum of audiences Notable newspapers include the leftwing Haaretz, [671] centrist Yedioth Ahronoth, [672] and center-right Israel Hayom [673] There are several major TV channels which cater to different audiences, from Russian language Channel 9 [674] to Arabic language Kan 33 [675] The 2024 Freedom House report found Israeli media is \"vibrant and free to criticize government policy\" [676] In the 2024 Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, Israel was placed 101st of 180 countries, second in the Middle East and North Africa [677] [678] Reporters Without Borders noted that the Israel Defense Forces had killed more than 100 journalists in Gaza Since the Israel–Hamas war, Israel had been \"been trying to suppress the reporting coming out of the besieged enclave while disinformation infiltrates its own media ecosystem.\" [678] On 5 May 2024, Israel shut down the local offices of Qatari channel Al Jazeera [679] Israel later briefly seized equipment belonging to the Associated Press, saying that its video stream of Gaza was being provided to Al Jazeera; after an intervention by the U.S government the equipment was returned [680] [681] [682]\n\n\nMuseums\nThe Israel Museum in Jerusalem is one of Israel's most important cultural institutions [683] and houses the Dead Sea Scrolls, [684] along with an extensive collection of Judaica and European art [683] The Yad Vashem is the world central archive of Holocaust-related information [685] ANU - Museum of the Jewish People on the campus of Tel Aviv University, is an interactive museum devoted to the history of Jewish communities around the world [686]\n\n\nCuisine\nIsraeli cuisine includes local dishes as well as Jewish cuisine brought to the country by immigrants Particularly since the late 1970s, a fusion cuisine has developed [689] The cuisine has adopted, and continues to adapt, elements of the Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi styles of cooking It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in the Levantine, Arab, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, such as falafel, hummus, shakshouka, couscous, and za'atar Schnitzel, pizza, hamburgers, French fries, rice and salad are common.\n\n\nSports\nThe most popular spectator sports in Israel are association football and basketball [694] The Israeli Premier League is the country's premier football league, and the Israeli Basketball Premier League is the premier basketball league [695] Maccabi Haifa, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Beitar Jerusalem are the largest football clubs Maccabi Tel Aviv, Maccabi Haifa and Hapoel Tel Aviv have competed in the UEFA Champions League and Hapoel Tel Aviv reached the UEFA Cup quarter-finals Israel hosted and won the 1964 AFC Asian Cup; in 1970 the Israel national football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup, the only time it participated in the World Cup The 1974 Asian Games, held in Tehran, were the last Asian Games in which Israel participated, plagued by Arab countries that refused to compete with Israel Israel was excluded from the 1978 Asian Games and since then has not competed in Asian sport events [696] In 1994, UEFA agreed to admit Israel, and its football teams now compete in Europe Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C has won the European championship in basketball six times [697]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nCitations\nGovernment\n\n\nSources\nGovernment\n\n\nExternal links\nGovernment\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000 After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds [11] Toronto's bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids

July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville)

fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta) [12]\n\n\nCosts\nOn 6 March 2009, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games reported that total spending on the Games was \"generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games\", which was equivalent to about US$15 billion They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million [14] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever\" [15] [16] [17] Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding [18] The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games Indirect capital costs—those not directly related to staging the Games—are not included The Beijing Olympics' cost of US$6.8 billion compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and US$15 billion for London 2012 [19]\n\n\nVenues\nBy May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun [20] The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing, and constructed 59 training facilities The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Peking University Gymnasium, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1 billion (RMB¥17.4 billion) in corporate bids and tenders Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics [21] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the \"uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone\", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong [22] Some stadiums were built on the former site of hutong neighbourhoods, including Qianmen Subdistrict [23]\n\n\nTransport\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster [29] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues [30] [31]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as Dancing Beijing The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character for \"capital\" (京, also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture IOC president Jacques Rogge was rather pleased with the emblem, saying, \"Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.\" [34]\n\n\nMascots\nThe mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin (韩美林) The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite When their Chinese characters are combined, they form 北京欢迎你, or \"Beijing Welcomes You\" A year before the Games in 2007, the 100-episode The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa featuring the mascots, was released.\n\n\nMedia coverage\nThe 2008 Games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the host broadcaster [40] In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast only half of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics in HD [41] [42] In their bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission that there would be \"no restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games.\" [43] However, some media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this commitment [e]\n\n\nTheme song\nThe theme song of the 2008 Summer Olympics was \"You and Me\", which was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony It was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan and British singer Sarah Brightman [52] [53] The theme song was originally going to be a song called \"So much love, so far away (Tanto amor, tan lejos)\" written by Cuban singer-songwriter Jon Secada and Peruvian singer-songwriter Gian Marco under production from Cuban producer Emilio Estefan Jr from EMI [54]\n\n\nTorch relay\nThe design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the \"Propitious Clouds\" (祥云) The torch was designed to remain lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour [55]\n\n\nThe Games\nAll but one of the 205 recognized National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed as of 2008 [update]  participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei [69] Three countries participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, Montenegro and Tuvalu [70]\n\n\nParticipating National Olympic Committees\nAll but one of the 205 recognized National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed as of 2008 [update]  participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei [69] Three countries participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, Montenegro and Tuvalu [70]\n\n\nNumber of athletes by National Olympic Committees\nAthletes from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and used the National Banner Song as their official anthem The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong A compromise based at the Nagoya Protocol about the naming was reached some months before the opening ceremonies, and Taiwan was referred to during the Games as \"Chinese Taipei\", rather than \"Taipei, China,\" as the mainland China government had proposed In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between Taipei and Hong Kong,China on protocol order [78]\n\n\nNational participation changes\nAthletes from the Republic

of athletes with disabilities\nSouth African swimmer Natalie du Toit, whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics The five time gold medalist at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivér Halassy in 1936 She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than

"article": "**2008 Summer Olympics**\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, were held in Beijing, China, from August 8 to August 24, 2008. The Games were the 29th edition of the Summer Olympics, a premier international multi-sport event held every four years.\n\n**Organisation**\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics were held under the direction of Liu Qi, the President of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG). Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on July 13, 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000.\n\n**Bid**\n\nThe Beijing bid was led by Liu Qi, the President of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG). Beijing's bid was based on the theme of \"One World, One Dream,\" and emphasized the city's rich history, cultural heritage, and modern infrastructure. The bid also highlighted Beijing's commitment to sustainability, accessibility, and social responsibility.\n\n**Costs**\n\nThe total spending on the 2008 Summer Olympics was estimated to be around US$15 billion, with the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) reporting that the costs were \"generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.\" However, other reports estimated the total costs to be between $40 to $44 billion, making the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever.\" The budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns.\n\n**Venues**\n\nBy May 2007, the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun. The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing, and constructed 59 training facilities. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Peking University Gymnasium, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center.\n\n**Transport**\n\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster. Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as \"Dancing Beijing.\" The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character for \"capital\" (京, also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was rather pleased with the emblem, saying, \"Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.\"\n\n**Mascots**\n\nThe mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin. The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite. When their Chinese characters are combined, they form 北京欢迎你, or \"Beijing Welcomes You.\"\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe 2008 Games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the host broadcaster. In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast only half of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics in HD. In their bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission that there would be \"no restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games.\" However, some media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this commitment.\n\n**Theme Song**\n\nThe theme song of the 2008 Summer Olympics was \"You and Me,\" which was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony. The song was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan and British singer Sarah Brightman.\n\n**Torch Relay**\n\nThe design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the \"Propitious Clouds\" (祥云). The torch was designed to remain lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour.\n\n**The Games**\n\nThe program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3,000-meter (9,843 ft) steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.\n\n**Calendar**\n\nIn the following calendar for the 2008 Summer Olympics, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number of bullets per box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day.\n\n**Records**\n\n125 Olympic records, including 37 world records, were set in various events at the Games. In swimming, sixty-five Olympic swimming records, including 25 world records, were broken because of the use of the LZR Racer, a specialized swimming suit developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport.\n\n**Opening Ceremony**\n\nThe opening ceremony officially began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on August 8, 2008. The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture, and the ceremonial start comprised a triple eight for the date and one extra for time (close to 08:08:08 pm). The ceremony was co-directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers.\n\n**Closing Ceremony**\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on August 24, 2008. It began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.\n\n**Medal Table**\n\nOf the 204 nations that participated in the 2008 Games, 87 earned medals and 54 of those won at least one gold medal, both of these figures setting new records for Olympic Games.

The United States won 36 gold medals, and Russia won 23 gold medals.\n\n**Concerns and Controversies**\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including claims that China violated its pledge to allow open media access, various claims of human rights violations, its alleged continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan, and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and environs, proposed boycotts, warnings of the possibility that the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups, disruption from Tibetan separatist protesters, and religious persecutions.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics have been generally accepted by the world's media as a logistical success.

Olympic Games reported that total spending on the Games was \"generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games\", which was equivalent to about US$15 billion They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million [14] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever\" [15] [16] [17] Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding [18] The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games Indirect capital costs—those

bids and tenders Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics [21] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the \"uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone\", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong [22] Some stadiums were built on the former site of hutong neighbourhoods, including Qianmen Subdistrict [23]\n\n\nTransport\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was

Born Maxwell Alexander Fraser on 14 June 1957 in Brixton, South London, Jazz's music career spanned over three decades, during which he released several critically acclaimed albums and singles.\n\nMusic Career\n------------\n\nMaxi Jazz was born in Brixton, South London, in 1957. He developed a passion for music at an early age and began his career as a DJ in 1984, founding the Soul Food Café System. As a DJ, Jazz was known for his eclectic taste in music, which spanned from hip-hop to soul and electronic dance music. He first aired his sound as a DJ calling it \"In the Soul Kitchen with DJ Maxi Jazz\" on pirate radio station Reach FM London from 1985 to 1986. He subsequently transferred this sound to pirate radio station LWR in 1987.\n\nHip Hop Beginnings\n------------------\n\nMaxi Jazz's early career was heavily influenced by hip-hop music, which he discovered in 1983. He began DJing hip-hop tracks in local clubs and parties, and quickly gained a reputation as one of the most talented young DJs in the scene. Jazz's love for hip-hop music was evident in his early work as a DJ, where he would often mix and blend hip-hop tracks with soul and electronic music.\n\nFaithless\n----------\n\nIn 1995, Jazz met Rollo Armstrong in a studio and went on to form Faithless, together with Jamie Catto and Sister Bliss. As a Soka Gakkai Buddhist, Jazz's strong beliefs and the band's own strong individual beliefs contrasted with the name 'Faithless', which was chosen during the writing of the song \"Salva Mea\". Armstrong had asked Jazz to write and sing on a dance track about frustration, which was something to which Jazz could relate from his own experiences. The subject matter of Jazz's lyrics ranged from upbeat to melancholic, covering a range of personal and social issues, including current affairs and social commentary.\n\nMaxi Jazz and the E-Type Boys\n-----------------------------\n\nIn 2015, Jazz began fronting a newly assembled band of musicians named Maxi Jazz & the E-Type Boys. Jazz provided lead vocals and also played guitar in the band. They made a number of festival appearances, including some at the same events at which Faithless were billed. The E-Type Boys' music was a fusion of rock and electronic dance music, with Jazz's soulful vocals taking center stage.\n\nOther\n-----\n\nOn 20 October 2018, Jazz performed on stage as part of the Gatecrasher Classical event at Sheffield Arena, celebrating 25 years of the Gatecrasher brand. The event featured a unique blend of classical music and electronic dance music, with Jazz's performance being a highlight of the evening.\n\nMotor Sports\n------------\n\nJazz founded Maxi Jazz Racing in 2000, when he asked Rae Claydon to enter him in the Ford Fiesta Championship for the 2000 season. However, Jazz was only able to race occasionally due to his musical obligations. Despite this, Jazz remained passionate about motor sports and continued to participate in various racing events throughout his career.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nJazz lived in West Norwood, in the London Borough of Lambeth. As a Soka Gakkai Buddhist, he advocated the work of the Burma Campaign UK. Jazz was known for his kind and compassionate nature, and was widely respected by his peers and fans alike.\n\nDeath\n-----\n\nJazz died \"peacefully in his sleep\" at his home in South London, after a long illness, on 23 December 2022 at the age of 65. His funeral was held on 30 January 2023.\n\nTributes\n--------\n\nFaithless shared their tribute, \"He was a man who changed our lives in so many ways. He gave proper meaning and message to our music. He was also a lovely human being with time for everyone and a wisdom that was both profound and accessible. It was an honour and, of course, a true pleasure to work with him. He was a brilliant lyricist, a DJ, a Buddhist, a magnificent stage presence, car lover, endless talker, beautiful person, moral compass and genius.\"\n\nDido, sister of Rollo and a regular collaborator with Faithless, tweeted her tribute, \"RIP Maxi. It was an absolute honour to know you, be inspired by you, listen to you and sing with you. Your voice and words will never leave my head.\"\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\nWith Faithless:\n\n* \"Reverence\" (1996)\n* \"Sunday 8PM\" (1998)\n* \"Outrospective\" (2001)\n* \"No Roots\" (2002)\n* \"To All New Arrivals\" (2006)\n* \"The Works\" (2008)\n* \"Faithless 2.0\" (2010)\n* \"The Dance\" (2015)\n\nWith 1 Giant Leap:\n\n* \"1 Giant Leap\" (1999)\n\nWith Soul Food Cafe:\n\n* \"In the Soul Kitchen\" (1986)\n\nWith the E-Type Boys:\n\n* \"Maxi Jazz & the E-Type Boys\" (2015)\n\nSolo:\n\n* \"Maxi Jazz\" (2020)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links:", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Maxi_Jazz\" following this outline:\n\n\nMusic career\nMaxi Jazz was born Maxwell Alexander Fraser on 14 June 1957 [1] in Brixton, South London [2] He founded the Soul Food Café System as a DJ in 1984, having discovered hip hop a year earlier He first aired the sound as a DJ calling it \"In the Soul Kitchen with DJ Maxi Jazz\" on pirate radio station Reach FM London from 1985 to 1986 He transferred this sound to pirate radio station LWR in 1987.\n\n\nHip hop beginnings\nMaxi Jazz was born Maxwell Alexander Fraser on 14 June 1957 [1] in Brixton, South London [2] He founded the Soul Food Café System as a DJ in 1984, having discovered hip hop a year earlier He first aired the sound as a DJ calling it \"In the Soul Kitchen with DJ Maxi Jazz\" on pirate radio station Reach FM London from 1985 to 1986 He transferred this sound to pirate radio station LWR in 1987.\n\n\nFaithless\nIn 1995, Jazz met Rollo Armstrong in a studio and went on to form Faithless, together with Jamie Catto and Sister Bliss As a Soka Gakkai Buddhist, his strong beliefs and the band's own strong individual beliefs contrast with the name 'Faithless', which was chosen during the writing of the song \"Salva Mea\" Armstrong had asked Jazz to write and sing on a dance track about frustration, [3] which was something to which Jazz could relate from his own experiences The subject matter of Jazz's lyrics range from upbeat to melancholic His work covered a range of personal and social issues, including current affairs and social commentary [citation needed]\n\n\nMaxi Jazz and the E-Type Boys\nIn 2015, he began fronting a newly assembled band of musicians named Maxi Jazz & the E-Type Boys Jazz provided lead vocals and also played guitar in the band They made a number of festival appearances, including some at the same events at which Faithless were billed [6]\n\n\nOther\nOn 20 October 2018, he performed on stage as part of the Gatecrasher Classical event at Sheffield Arena, celebrating 25 years of the Gatecrasher brand [7]\n\n\nMotor sports\nJazz founded Maxi Jazz Racing in 2000 when he asked Rae Claydon to enter him in the Ford Fiesta Championship for the 2000 season, [9] but was only able to race occasionally due to his musical obligations.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJazz lived in West Norwood, in the London Borough of Lambeth A Soka Gakkai Buddhist, he advocated the work of the Burma Campaign UK [3]\n\n\nDeath\nJazz died \"peacefully in his sleep\" at his home in South London, after a long illness, [15] on 23 December 2022 at the age of 65 [16] His funeral was held on 30 January 2023 [17]\n\n\nTributes\nFaithless shared their tribute, \"He was a man who changed our lives in so many ways He gave proper meaning and message to our music He was also a lovely human being with time for everyone and a wisdom that was both profound and accessible It was an honour and, of course, a true pleasure to work with him He was a brilliant lyricist, a DJ, a Buddhist, a magnificent stage presence, car lover, endless talker, beautiful person, moral compass and genius.\" [18] Dido, sister of Rollo and a regular collaborator with Faithless tweeted her tribute, \"RIP Maxi It was an absolute honour to know you, be inspired by you, listen to you and sing with you Your voice and words will never leave my head.\" [19]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nWith Faithless\n\n\nWith 1 Giant Leap\n\n\nWith Soul Food Cafe\n\n\nWith the E-Type Boys\n\n\nSolo\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "U.S._state", "content": "\nList\nThe 50 U.S states, in alphabetical order, along with each state's flag:\n\n\nBackground\nThe 13 original states came into existence in July 1776 during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), as the successors of the Thirteen Colonies, upon agreeing to the Lee Resolution [8] and signing the United States Declaration of Independence [9] Prior to these events each state had been a British colony; [8] each then joined the first Union of states between 1777 and 1781, upon ratifying the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S constitution [10] [11] Also during this period, the newly independent states developed their own individual state constitutions, among the earliest written constitutions in the world [12] Although different in detail, these state constitutions shared features that would be important in the American constitutional order: they were republican in form, and separated power among three branches, most had bicameral legislatures, and contained statements, or a bill, of rights [13] Later, from 1787 to 1790, each of the states also ratified a new federal frame of government in the Constitution of the United States [14] In relation to the states, the U.S Constitution elaborated concepts of federalism [15]\n\n\nGovernments\nUnder U.S constitutional law, the 50 individual states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions [16] The states are not administrative divisions of the country; the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution reserves to the states or to the people all powers of government not delegated to the federal government.\n\n\nConstitutions\nThe government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution, all of which are written constitutions Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborated than their federal counterpart For example, before its revision in 2022, the Constitution of Alabama, contained 310,296 words, which is more than 40 times as many as the U.S Constitution [19] In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch frame of government: executive, legislative, and judicial (even though doing so has never been required) [19] [20]\n\n\nExecutive\nIn each state, the chief executive is called the governor, who serves as both head of state and head of government All governors are chosen by statewide direct election The governor may approve or veto bills passed by the state legislature, as well as recommend and work for the passage of bills, usually supported by their political party In 44 states, governors have line item veto power [23] Most states have a plural executive, meaning that the governor is not the only government official in the state responsible for its executive branch In these states, executive power is distributed amongst other officials, [24] elected by the people independently of the governor—such as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state, and others.\n\n\nLegislative\nThe primary responsibilities of state legislatures are to enact state laws and appropriate money for the administration of public policy [23] In all states, if the governor vetoes a bill (or a portion of one), it can still become law if the legislature overrides the veto (repasses the bill), which in most states requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber [23] In 49 of the 50 states the legislature consists of two chambers: a lower house (variously called the House of Representatives, State Assembly, General Assembly or House of Delegates) and a smaller upper house, in all states called the Senate The exception is the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, meaning it has only a single chamber [26] Most states have a part-time legislature (traditionally called a citizen legislature) Ten state legislatures are considered full-time; these bodies are more similar to the U.S Congress than are the others [27]\n\n\nJudicial\nStates can also organize their judicial systems differently from the federal judiciary, as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural due process Most have a trial-level court, generally called a district court, superior court or circuit court, a first-level appellate court, generally called a court of appeal (or appeals), and a supreme court Oklahoma and Texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals Uniquely, in New York State, the trial court is called the Supreme Court; appeals go up first to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division, and from there to its highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.\n\n\nUnitarism\nAll states are unitary states, not federations or aggregates of local governments Local governments within them are created by and exist by virtue of state law, and local governments within each state are subject to the central authority of that particular state State governments commonly delegate some authority to local units and channel policy decisions down to them for implementation [30] In a few states, local units of government are permitted a degree of home rule over various matters The prevailing legal theory of state preeminence over local governments, referred to as Dillon's Rule, holds that,\n\n\nRelationships\nEach state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original states in all respects [33] With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v Hagan (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality [34] With the consent of Congress, states may enter into interstate compacts, agreements between two or more states Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights [35]\n\n\nInterstate\nEach state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original states in all respects [33] With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v Hagan (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality [34] With the consent of Congress, states may enter into interstate compacts, agreements between two or more states Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights [35]\n\n\nWith the federal government\nUnder Article IV, each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed [38] This guarantee has long been at the forefront of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-à-vis the government States are also guaranteed protection from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot but was not invoked.\n\n\nWith other countries\nU.S states are not sovereign in the Westphalian sense in international law which says that each State has sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs, to the exclusion of all external powers, on the principle of non-interference in another State's domestic affairs, and that each State (no matter how large or small) is equal in international law [55] Additionally, the 50 U.S states do not possess international legal sovereignty, meaning that they are not recognized by other sovereign States such as, for example, France, Germany or the United Kingdom [55] The federal government is responsible for international relations, but state and local government leaders do occasionally travel to other countries and form economic and cultural relationships.\n\n\nAdmission into the Union\nArticle IV also grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states [34] Article IV also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress This caveat was designed to give Eastern states that still had Western land claims (including Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia), to have a veto over whether their western counties could become states, [33] and has served this same function since, whenever a proposal to partition an existing state or states in order that a region within might either join another state or to create a new state has come before Congress.\n\n\nProposed additions\nPuerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S territory, refers to itself as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in the English version of its constitution, and as \"Estado Libre Asociado\" (literally, Associated Free State) in the Spanish version As with all U.S territories, its residents do not have full representation in the United States Congress Puerto Rico has limited representation in the U.S House of Representatives in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a delegate with limited voting rights in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, but no voting rights otherwise [67]\n\n\nPuerto Rico\nPuerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S territory, refers to itself as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in the English version of its constitution, and as

has limited representation in the U.S House of Representatives in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a delegate with limited voting rights in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, but no voting rights otherwise [67]\n\n\nWashington, D.C.\nThe intention of the Founding Fathers was that the United States capital should be at a neutral site, not giving favor to any existing state; as a result, the District of Columbia was created in 1800 to serve as the seat of government As it is not a state, the district does not have representation in the Senate and has a non-voting delegate in the House; neither does it have a sovereign elected government Additionally, before ratification of the 23rd Amendment in 1961, district citizens did not get the right to vote in presidential elections.\n\n\nSecession from the Union\nThe Constitution speaks of \"union\" several times, but does not explicitly discuss the issue of whether a state can secede from the Union Its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, stated that the union of the United States \"shall be perpetual.\" The question of whether or not individual states held the unilateral right to secession was a passionately debated feature of the nations' political discourse from early in its history and remained a difficult and divisive topic until the American Civil War In 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states each declared secession from the United States and joined to form the Confederate States of America (CSA) Following the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in 1865, those states were brought back into the Union during the ensuing Reconstruction era The federal government never recognized the sovereignty of the CSA, nor the validity of the ordinances of secession adopted by the seceding states [6] [77]\n\n\nName origins\nThe 50 states have taken their names from a wide variety of languages Twenty-four state names originate from Native American languages Of these, eight are from Algonquian languages, seven are from Siouan languages, three are from Iroquoian languages, one is from Uto-Aztecan languages and five others are from other indigenous languages Hawaii's name is derived from the Polynesian Hawaiian language.\n\n\nGeography\nThe borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters Their western boundaries were subsequently modified as the states ceded their western land claims to the Federal government during the 1780s and 1790s Many state borders beyond those of the original 13 were set by Congress as it created territories, divided them, and over time, created states within them Territorial and new state lines often followed various geographic features (such as rivers or mountain range peaks), and were influenced by settlement or transportation patterns At various times, national borders with territories formerly controlled by other countries (British North America, New France, New Spain including Spanish Florida, and Russian America) became institutionalized as the borders of U.S states In the West, relatively arbitrary straight lines following latitude and longitude often prevail due to the sparseness of settlement west of the Mississippi River.\n\n\nBorders\nThe borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters Their western boundaries were subsequently

sparseness of settlement west of the Mississippi River.\n\n\nRegional grouping\nStates may be grouped in regions; there are many variations and possible groupings Many are defined in law or regulations by the federal government For example, the United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions [80] The Census Bureau region definition (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) is \"widely used .. for data collection and analysis,\" [81] and is the most commonly used classification system [82] [83] [84] Other multi-state regions are unofficial, and defined by geography or cultural affinity rather than by state lines.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 50 U.S. states are the primary

Wyoming\n\n# Background\n\nThe 13 original states came into existence in July 1776 during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), as the successors of the Thirteen Colonies, upon agreeing to the Lee Resolution and signing the United States Declaration of Independence. Prior to these events, each state had been a British colony, and each then joined the first Union of states between 1777 and 1781, upon ratifying the Articles of Confederation, the first U.S. constitution. Also during this period, the newly independent states developed their own individual state constitutions, among the earliest written constitutions in the world. Although different in detail, these state constitutions shared features that would be important in the American constitutional order: they were republican in form, and separated power among three branches, most had bicameral legislatures, and contained statements, or a bill, of rights. Later, from 1787 to 1790, each of the states also ratified a new federal frame of government in the Constitution of the United States. In relation to the states, the U.S. Constitution elaborated concepts of federalism.\n\n# Governments\n\nUnder U.S. constitutional law, the 50 individual states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions. The states are not administrative divisions of the country; the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution reserves to the states or to the people all powers of government not delegated to the federal government. Each state has its own constitution, government, and laws, and is responsible for its own internal affairs. The state governments are structured in accordance with their individual constitutions, which are written documents that outline the powers and responsibilities of the state government.\n\n# Constitutions\n\nThe government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution, all of which are written constitutions. Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborated than their federal counterpart. For example, the Constitution of Alabama contains 310,296 words, which is more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution. In practice, each state has adopted a three-branch frame of government: executive, legislative, and judicial (even though doing so has never been required).\n\n# Executive\n\nIn each state, the chief executive is called the governor, who serves as both head of state and head of government. All governors are chosen by statewide direct election. The governor may approve or veto bills passed by the state legislature, as well as recommend and work for the passage of bills, usually supported by their political party. In 44 states, governors have line item veto power. Most states have a plural executive, meaning that the governor is not the only government official in the state responsible for its executive branch. In these states, executive power is distributed amongst other officials, elected by the people independently of the governor—such as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state, and others.\n\n# Legislative\n\nThe primary responsibilities of state legislatures are to enact state laws and appropriate money for the administration of public policy. In all states, if the governor vetoes a bill (or a portion of one), it can still become law if the legislature overrides the veto (repasses the bill), which in most states requires a two-thirds vote in each chamber. In 49 of the 50 states, the legislature consists of two chambers: a lower house (variously called the House of Representatives, State Assembly, General Assembly, or House of Delegates) and a smaller upper house, in all states called the Senate. The exception is the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, meaning it has only a single chamber. Most states have a part-time legislature (traditionally called a citizen legislature). Ten state legislatures are considered full-time; these bodies are more similar to the U.S. Congress than are the others.\n\n# Judicial\n\nStates can also organize their judicial systems differently from the federal judiciary, as long as they protect the federal constitutional right of their citizens to procedural due process. Most have a trial-level court, generally called a district court, superior court, or circuit court, a first-level appellate court, generally called a court of appeal (or appeals), and a supreme court. Oklahoma and Texas have separate highest courts for criminal appeals. Uniquely, in New York State, the trial court is called the Supreme Court; appeals go up first to the Supreme Court's Appellate Division, and from there to its highest court, the New York Court of Appeals.\n\n# Unitarism\n\nAll states are unitary states, not federations or aggregates of local governments. Local governments within them are created by and exist by virtue of state law, and local governments within each state are subject to the central authority of that particular state. State governments commonly delegate some authority to local units and channel policy decisions down to them for implementation. In a few states, local units of government are permitted a degree of home rule over various matters. The prevailing legal theory of state preeminence over local governments, referred to as Dillon's Rule, holds that local governments have only those powers that are explicitly granted to them by the state.\n\n# Relationships\n\nEach state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original states in all respects. With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality. With the consent of Congress, states may enter into interstate compacts, agreements between two or more states. Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights.\n\n# Interstate\n\nEach state admitted to the Union by Congress since 1789 has entered it on an equal footing with the original states in all respects. With the growth of states' rights advocacy during the antebellum period, the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan (1845), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality. With the consent of Congress, states may enter into interstate compacts, agreements between two or more states. Compacts are frequently used to manage a shared resource, such as transportation infrastructure or water rights.\n\n# With the federal government\n\nUnder Article IV, each state is guaranteed a form of government that is grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed. This guarantee has long been at the forefront of the debate about the rights of citizens vis-à-vis the government. States are also guaranteed protection from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence.\n\n# With other countries\n\nU.S. states are not sovereign in the Westphalian sense in international law, which says that each state has sovereignty over its territory and domestic affairs, to the exclusion of all external powers, on the principle of non-interference in another state's domestic affairs, and that each state (no matter how large or small) is equal in international law. Additionally, the 50 U.S. states do not possess international legal sovereignty, meaning that they are not recognized by other sovereign states, such as, for example, France, Germany, or the United Kingdom. The federal government is responsible for international relations, but state and local government leaders do occasionally travel to other countries and form economic and cultural relationships.\n\n# Admission into the Union\n\nArticle IV also grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. Article IV also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress.\n\n# Proposed additions\n\nPuerto Rico, an unincorporated U.S. territory, refers to itself as the \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in the English version of its constitution and as \"Estado Libre Asociado\" (literally, Associated Free State) in the Spanish version. As with all U.S. territories, its residents do not have full representation in the United States Congress. Puerto Rico has limited representation in the U.S. House of Representatives in the form of a Resident Commissioner, a delegate with limited voting rights in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, but no voting rights otherwise.\n\n# Secession from the Union\n\nThe Constitution speaks of \"union\" several times, but does not explicitly discuss the issue of whether a state can secede from the Union. Its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, stated that the union of the United States \"shall be perpetual.\" The question of whether or not individual states held the unilateral right to secession was a passionately debated feature of the nation's political discourse from early in its history and remained a difficult and divisive topic until the American Civil War. In 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states each declared secession from the United States and joined to form the Confederate States of America (CSA). Following the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in 1865, those states were brought back into the Union during the ensuing Reconstruction era. The federal government never recognized the sovereignty of the CSA, nor the validity of the ordinances of secession adopted by the seceding states.\n\n# Name origins\n\nThe 50 states have taken their names from a wide variety of languages. Twenty-four state names originate from Native American languages. Of these, eight are from Algonquian languages, seven are from Siouan languages, three are from Iroquoian languages, one is from Uto-Aztecan languages, and five others are from other indigenous languages. Hawaii's name is derived from the Polynesian Hawaiian language.\n\n# Geography\n\nThe borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters. Their western boundaries were subsequently modified as the states ceded their western land claims to the Federal government during the 1780s and 1790s. Many state borders beyond those of the original 13 were set by Congress as it created territories, divided them, and over time, created states within them. Territorial and new state lines often followed various geographic features (such as rivers or mountain range peaks), and were influenced by settlement or transportation patterns.\n\n# Borders\n\nThe borders of the 13 original states were largely determined by colonial charters.

Many are defined in law or regulations by the federal government. For example, the United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions. The Census Bureau region definition (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) is \"widely used...for data collection and analysis,\" and is the most commonly used classification system.\n\nReferences:\nFurther reading:\nExternal links:\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length, and the content is factual and informative.

Born on June 3, 1925, in East Harlem, New York City, Curtis's life was marked by his struggles, triumphs, and explorations in the entertainment industry, philanthropy, and personal relationships.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nTony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz to Helen (née Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz, a Jewish family of Hungarian descent. He was the first of three boys born in the Schwartz family. Curtis's early life was marked by his family's financial struggles, and he often found himself in the role of caregiver for his younger siblings. His parents were both immigrants from Hungary, and their experiences had a lasting impact on Curtis's life and perspectives.\n\n**Military Service**\n\nCurtis enlisted in the United States Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, inspired by the heroic roles of Cary Grant and Tyrone Power in films like Destination Tokyo and Crash Dive. He joined the Pacific submarine force and served on the USS Proteus, a submarine tender, until the end of World War II. Curtis witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, from his ship's signal bridge, about a mile away from the actual ceremony.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1948, Curtis arrived in Hollywood, California, at the age of 23. He met Jack Warner on the plane to California, which led to his initial contract with Warner Bros. Studios. Curtis changed his name from Bernard Schwartz to Anthony Curtis, inspired by the novel Anthony Adverse and a surname in his mother's family. Universal Pictures taught him fencing and riding, but Curtis's primary interest was in girls and money. Despite his initial pessimism about his chances of becoming a major star, Curtis's talent and charm eventually led to his rise to stardom.\n\n**Stardom**\n\nCurtis's breakthrough role came in 1951 with The Prince Who Was a Thief, a swashbuckler set in the Middle East. The film was a hit at the box office, and Curtis was now established as a leading man. His subsequent roles in films like Trapeze (1956) and Spartacus (1960) solidified his position as a major star. Curtis also formed his own independent film production company, Curtleigh Productions, with his wife, Janet Leigh.\n\n**Comedic Roles**\n\nIn the 1960s, Curtis began to explore comedic roles, which led to the formation of two new film production companies: Curtis Enterprises, Incorporated, and Reynard Productions, Incorporated. His films like 40 Pounds of Trouble (1962) and Some Like It Hot (1959) showcased his comedic talents. Curtis's decision to take a pay cut to play the title role in The Boston Strangler (1968) was a deliberate move to challenge himself and demonstrate his versatility as an actor.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nCurtis's later career spanned various genres, including drama, horror, and comedy. He appeared in films like The Manitou (1978), a horror film, and The Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978), a comedy. Curtis also had good roles in It Rained All Night the Day I Left (1980), Little Miss Marker (1980), and The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980). He continued to make occasional guest appearances on television, including a stint as a host on the documentary-retrospective series \"Hollywood Babylon\" in 1992-1993.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nCurtis was married six times, including to actress Janet Leigh, whom he married in 1951. The studio he was under contract with, Universal-International, attempted to dissuade Curtis from marrying Leigh, fearing it would harm his box office appeal. Curtis and Leigh defied the studio and eloped, marrying by a local judge in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nCurtis and his daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, took a renewed interest in their family's Hungarian Jewish heritage in the 1990s. They helped finance the rebuilding of the Great Synagogue in Budapest, Hungary, the largest synagogue in Europe. Curtis also founded the Emanuel Foundation for Hungarian Culture, which works for the restoration and preservation of synagogues and Jewish cemeteries in Hungary.\n\n**Books and Appearances**\n\nIn 1965, Curtis was animated in an episode of The Flintstones, and his character, Stoney Curtis, voiced by Curtis himself. A mural featuring his likeness, painted by artist George Sportelli, was unveiled on the Sunset Boulevard overpass of the Hollywood Freeway Highway 101 in Los Angeles in 1994. Curtis's face is featured among the celebrities on the cover of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album by The Beatles.\n\n**Health and Death**\n\nIn 1974, Curtis developed a heavy cocaine addiction while filming Lepke, which led to his decline in stardom. He underwent heart bypass surgery in 1994, after suffering a heart attack. Curtis died on September 29, 2010, at the age of 85, due to complications from cardiac arrest.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* The Prince Who Was a Thief (1951)\n* Trapeze (1956)\n* Spartacus (1960)\n* Some Like It Hot (1959)\n* The Boston Strangler (1968)\n* The Manitou (1978)\n* The Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978)\n* It Rained All Night the Day I Left (1980)\n* Little Miss Marker (1980)\n* The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980)\n\n**Television**\n\n* Vega$ (1978-1981)\n* \"Hollywood Babylon\" (1992-1993)\n\n**Radio Appearances**\n\n* The Tony Curtis Show (1958)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical (1959)\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama (1960)\n\n**Books**\n\n* Tony Curtis: The Autobiography (1993)\n* Hollywood Babylon (1992)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tony_Curtis\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nTony Curtis was born Bernard Schwartz on June 3, 1925, at the Fifth Avenue Hospital corner of East 105th Street in East Harlem, Manhattan the first of three boys born to Helen (née Klein) and Emanuel Schwartz [1] [2]\n\n\nMilitary service\nCurtis enlisted in the United States Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor Inspired by Cary Grant's role in Destination Tokyo and Tyrone Power's in Crash Dive (1943), he joined the Pacific submarine force [4] Curtis served aboard a submarine tender, the USS Proteus, until the end of the Second World War On September 2, 1945, Curtis witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay from his ship's signal bridge about a mile away [6]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1948, Curtis arrived in Hollywood at age 23 In his autobiography, Curtis described how by chance he met Jack Warner on the plane to California.\n\n\nUniversal as \"Anthony Curtis\"\nUnder contract at Universal Pictures, he changed his name from Bernard Schwartz to Anthony Curtis and met unknown actors Rock Hudson, James Best, Julie Adams and Piper Laurie [7] The first name was from the novel Anthony Adverse and \"Curtis\" was from Kurtz, a surname in his mother's family [8] Although Universal Pictures taught him fencing and riding, Curtis admitted he was initially only interested in girls and money—adding that he was pessimistic regarding his chances of becoming a major star Curtis's biggest fear was having to return home to the Bronx as a failure:\n\n\nStardom\nCurtis was receiving numerous fan letters, so Universal gave him the starring role in The Prince Who Was a Thief (1951), a swashbuckler set in the Middle East with Piper Laurie It was a hit at the box office and Curtis was now established [citation needed]\n\n\nMajor star\nCurtis graduated to larger projects when he was cast as a co-star of Burt Lancaster and Gina Lollobrigida in Hecht-Lancaster Productions' Trapeze (1956) It was one of the biggest hits of the year Curtis and Leigh formed their own independent film production company, Curtleigh Productions, in early 1955 [10] [11]\n\n\nComedic roles\nOn October 6, 1961, Curtis formed a new film production company, Curtis Enterprises, Incorporated [15] The company would make 40 Pounds of Trouble, which co-starred Curtis, Suzanne Pleshette and Phil Silvers; it was the first motion picture ever filmed at Disneyland [16] [17] [18] On August 3, 1962, Curtis formed another new film production company, Reynard Productions, Incorporated [19]\n\n\nThe Boston Strangler\nBecause of the poor performance of a series of comedies, Curtis fired his agent and took a pay cut to $100,000 to play the title role in The Boston Strangler (1968), his first dramatic film in several years [20] Response from the critics and public was excellent He returned to comedy for Monte Carlo or Bust!

It follows the life of Devi Vishwakumar, a high school student navigating her relationships, family, and identity.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story centers around Devi Vishwakumar, a 15-year-old Indian-American Tamil girl from Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. After her father, Mohan, dies suddenly, Devi enters paralysis due to psychological trauma, making her unable to walk for three months. One day, in an attempt to see her crush Paxton Hall-Yoshida, she miraculously recovers and stands on her legs. As Devi navigates her relationships with her friends, family, and crushes, she faces various challenges, including her mother's remarriage, her friend Eleanor's learning her absentee mother has been back in town for months with no contact, Fabiola's struggle to come out as lesbian, and Kamala's attempt to hide her college boyfriend from her family, who expect her to wed Prashant, an Indian man she's never met, in an arranged marriage.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe main cast of the series includes Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Devi Vishwakumar, Poorna Jagannathan as Nalini Vishwakumar, and Richa Moorjani as Aneesa Qureshi.

{"title": "MKUltra", "content": "\nBackground\nThe first notable interrogation experiments occurred during World War II, when Nazi scientists working in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau conducted interrogation experiments on human subjects Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Russian, Jewish, and other nationalities' prisoners of war [19] They aimed to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Plötner, \"eliminate the will of the person examined\" [19] American historian Stephen Kinzer argues that the CIA project was a \"continuation\" of these earlier Nazi experiments, citing the numerous German scientists who were hired to work for the U.S as part of Operation Paperclip [20]\n\n\nOrigin of the project\nThe first notable interrogation experiments occurred during World War II, when Nazi scientists working in the concentration camps of Auschwitz and Dachau conducted interrogation experiments on human subjects Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Russian, Jewish, and other nationalities' prisoners of war [19] They aimed to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Plötner, \"eliminate the will of the person examined\" [19] American historian Stephen Kinzer argues that the CIA project was a \"continuation\" of these earlier Nazi experiments, citing the numerous German scientists who were hired to work for the U.S as part of Operation Paperclip [20]\n\n\nAims and leadership\nThe project was headed by Sidney Gottlieb but began on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles on April 13, 1953 [28] [29] Its aim was to develop mind-controlling drugs for use against the Soviet bloc in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind control techniques on U.S prisoners of war during the Korean War [30] The CIA wanted to use similar methods on their own captives, and was interested in manipulating foreign leaders with such techniques, [31] devising several schemes to drug Fidel Castro It often conducted experiments without the subjects' knowledge and/or consent [32] In some cases, academic researchers were funded through grants from CIA front organizations but were unaware that the CIA was using their work for these purposes.\n\n\nApplications\nThe 1976 Church Committee report found that, in the MKDELTA program, \"Drugs were used primarily as an aid to interrogations, but MKULTRA/MKDELTA materials were also used for harassment, discrediting or disabling purposes.\" [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nOther related projects\nIn 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971 [42] The project was a joint project between the U.S Army Chemical Corps and the CIA's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents, with a focus on incapacitating agents Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques of producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements [42]\n\n\nExperiments on Americans\nCIA documents suggest that they investigated \"chemical, biological, and radiological\" methods of mind control as part of MKUltra [47] They spent an estimated $10 million or more, roughly $87.5 million adjusted for inflation [48]\n\n\nLSD\nIn 1938, LSD was created by Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland The early directors of MKUltra became aware of the existence of LSD and sought to use it for \"mind-control\" In the early 1950s, MKUltra director Sidney Gottlieb arranged for the CIA to buy the entire supply of LSD for $240,000, which in 2024, would be $4,227,079 [51] This LSD supply gave Gottlieb the ability to fulfill his experiment by spreading LSD to prisons, hospitals, institutions, clinics, and foundations in order to see how citizens would react to the drug without knowing exactly what was happening to them.\n\n\nOther drugs\nAnother technique investigated was the intravenous administration of a barbiturate into one arm and an amphetamine into the other [70] The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released.\nOther experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, alcohol and sodium pentothal [71]\n\n\nHypnosis\nDeclassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied hypnosis in the early 1950s Experimental goals included creating \"hypnotically induced anxieties\", \"hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter\", studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, \"hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects\", and studying \"relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis\" [72] They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.\n\n\nExperiments on Canadians\nThe CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the \"psychic driving\" concept, which the CIA found interesting Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University, and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (US$766,936 in 2024, adjusted for inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there The Montreal experiments research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA [73]: 141–142 \n\n\nMotivation and assessments\nHis work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Sutton, who was also involved in the Secret Intelligence Service and who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage [75]\n\n\nSecret detention camps\nIn areas under American control in the early 1950s in Europe and East Asia, mostly Japan, West Germany and the Philippines, the CIA created secret detention centers (Black sites) so that the U.S could avoid criminal prosecution The CIA captured people suspected of being enemy agents and other people it deemed \"expendable\" to undertake various types of torture and human experimentation on them The prisoners were interrogated while being administered psychoactive drugs, electroshocked and subjected to extremes of temperature, sensory isolation and the like to develop a better understanding of how to destroy and to control human minds [2]\n\n\nRevelation\nIn 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by the Watergate scandal, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed [80] Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms's purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977 These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977 [10]\n\n\n1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report\nThe U.S General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, the Department of Defense and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.\n\n\nDeath of Frank Olson\n\n\n\nLegal issues involving informed consent\nThe revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\n\n\nNotable people\nConfirmed experimenters:\n\n\nDocumented experimenters\nConfirmed experimenters:\n\n\nDocumented

for harassment, discrediting or disabling purposes.\" [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nOther related projects\nIn 1964, MKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program The MKSEARCH program was divided into two projects dubbed MKOFTEN and MKCHICKWIT Funding for MKSEARCH commenced in 1965, and ended in 1971 [42] The project was a joint project between the U.S Army Chemical Corps and the CIA's Office of Research and Development to find new offensive-use agents, with a focus on incapacitating agents Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques of producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements [42]\n\n\nExperiments on Americans\nCIA documents suggest that they investigated \"chemical, biological, and radiological\" methods of mind control as part of MKUltra [47] They spent an estimated $10 million or more, roughly $87.5 million adjusted for inflation [48]\n\n\nLSD\nIn 1938, LSD was created by Albert Hofmann at the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland The early directors of MKUltra became aware of the existence of LSD and sought to use it for \"mind-control\" In the early 1950s, MKUltra director Sidney Gottlieb arranged for the CIA to buy the entire supply of LSD for $240,000, which in 2024, would be $4,227,079 [51] This LSD supply gave Gottlieb the ability to fulfill his experiment by spreading LSD to prisons, hospitals, institutions, clinics, and foundations in order to see how citizens would react to the drug without knowing exactly what was happening to them.\n\n\nOther drugs\nAnother technique investigated was the intravenous administration of a barbiturate into one arm and an amphetamine into the other [70] The barbiturates were released into the person first, and as soon as the person began to fall asleep, the amphetamines were released.\nOther experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, alcohol and sodium pentothal [71]\n\n\nHypnosis\nDeclassified MKUltra documents indicate they studied hypnosis in the early 1950s Experimental goals included creating \"hypnotically induced anxieties\", \"hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter\", studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, \"hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects\", and studying \"relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis\" [72] They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.\n\n\nExperiments on Canadians\nThe CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the \"psychic driving\" concept, which the CIA found interesting Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University, and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 (US$766,936 in 2024, adjusted for inflation) to carry out MKUltra experiments there The Montreal experiments research funds were sent to Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know the money came from the CIA [73]: 141–142 \n\n\nMotivation and assessments\nHis work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas' Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Sutton, who was also involved in the Secret Intelligence Service and who experimented on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage [75]\n\n\nSecret detention camps\nIn areas under American control in the early 1950s in Europe and East Asia, mostly Japan, West Germany and the Philippines, the CIA created secret detention centers (Black sites) so that the U.S could avoid criminal prosecution The CIA captured people suspected of being enemy agents and other people it deemed \"expendable\" to undertake various types of torture and human experimentation on them The prisoners were interrogated while being administered psychoactive drugs, electroshocked and subjected to extremes of temperature, sensory isolation and the like to develop a better understanding of how to destroy and to control human minds [2]\n\n\nRevelation\nIn 1973, amid a government-wide panic caused by the Watergate scandal, CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed [80] Pursuant to this order, most CIA documents regarding the project were destroyed, making a full investigation of MKUltra impossible A cache of some 20,000 documents survived Helms's purge, as they had been incorrectly stored in a financial records building and were discovered following a FOIA request in 1977 These documents were fully investigated during the Senate Hearings of 1977 [10]\n\n\n1994 U.S. General Accounting Office report\nThe U.S General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, the Department of Defense and other national security agencies studied thousands of human subjects in tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.\n\n\nDeath of Frank Olson\n\n\n\nLegal issues involving informed consent\nThe revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress Frank Olson's family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson's family to apologize publicly.\n\n\nNotable people\nConfirmed

its nature and the destruction of most records This has also led to the urban legends that the human experiments performed by the CIA are ongoing into the present [125]\n\n\nTelevision\nUnited

17-pounder gun The second was the Persian Gulf War era Challenger 1, which was the British army's main battle tank (MBT) from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s [citation needed]\n\n\nChallenger 1\nThe Challenger 2 is the third vehicle of this name, the first being the A30 Challenger, a World War II design using the Cromwell tank chassis with a 17-pounder gun The second was the Persian Gulf War era Challenger 1, which was the British army's main battle tank (MBT) from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s [citation needed]\n\n\nChallenger 2 contest\nAs Challenger production ramped up the government was interested in marketing it to its traditional customers like Jordan To improve its sales prospects, the tank was entered in the 1987 running of the Canadian Army Trophy for tank performance, which had historically been won many times by British Army or Canadian Army units in British tanks In this run, however, the Challenger performed very poorly, with its units ending up at the bottom of the rankings While this performance was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense, including in comments in the House of Commons, it was a serious blow to its sales prospects It also proved only marginally more reliable than the Chieftain, which was considered unreliable and a maintenance problem in the field, and the lack of significant improvement was much to the annoyance of the British Army [19]\n\n\nPrototypes\nVickers received a £90 million contract for a demonstrator vehicle to be delivered by September 1990 Part of this proof-of-concept phase was the demonstration that a depleted uranium projectile and more powerful gunpowder charge could be developed for the updated \"CHARM\" 120 mm gun developed at Royal Ordinance, which would give it capability against the latest Soviet designs [21] [20] The demonstration phase had three milestones for progress, with dates of September 1989, March 1990, and September 1990 At the last of these milestones, Vickers was to have met 11 key criteria for the tank's design [21]\n\n\nProduction and delivery\nIn June 1991 the decision to buy Challenger 2 was made formal with a £520 million contract for 127 tanks and 13 driver training tanks [22] Production began in 1993 at two primary sites, Elswick, Tyne and Wear and Barnbow, Leeds, with over 250 subcontractors involved It was formerly accepted on 16 May 1994 with the first tanks delivered in July 1994 An order for a further 259 tanks and 9 driver trainers worth £800 million was placed in July The Challenger 2 failed its acceptance trials in 1994, and it was forced into the Progressive Reliability Growth Trial in 1995 Three vehicles were tested for 285 simulated battlefield days.\n\n\nLater developments and possible replacement\nThe Challenger 2 entered service with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, with the last delivered in 2002 After the Army 2020 restructuring, only three Challenger 2 Tank Regiments will remain: the Queen's Royal Hussars, the King's Royal Hussars and the Royal Tank Regiment, each of which is the tank regiment of an Armoured Infantry Brigade A single Army Reserve regiment, The Royal Wessex Yeomanry, will provide reservist Challenger crews to the regular regiments.\n\n\nSupply to Ukraine\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the then British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, declined Ukrainian requests for Challenger 2 tanks to be part of the military aid packages arranged by the United Kingdom and other NATO countries British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had said that the idea \"wouldn't work\" [35] In April 2022, Johnson and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz stated that both Western European allies would withhold their MBTs from the war Johnson instead chose to deploy British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to backfill the Polish Army and allowing the Polish government to donate Soviet-era T-72s to Ukraine [36] [37]\n\n\nDesign\nThe Challenger 2 is equipped with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, [11] the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1 The gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining Like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilisation system The turret has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees.\n\n\nArmament\nThe Challenger 2 is equipped with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, [11] the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1 The gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining Like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilisation system The turret has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees.\n\n\nFire control and sights\nThe digital fire control computer from Computing Devices Co of Canada contains two 32-bit processors with a MIL STD1553B databus It has capacity for additional

Chobham armour, also known as Dorchester, the details of which are classified but which is said to have a mass efficiency more than twice that of rolled homogeneous armour against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles Crew safety was paramount in the design It uses a solid state electric drive for turret and gun motion, instead of hydraulic systems that can leak fluid into the crew compartment.\n\n\nDrive system\nThe tank's drive system comprises:\n\n\nCrew and accommodation\nThe British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew, including a loader, after risk analysis of the incorporation of an automatic loader suggested that autoloaders reduced battlefield survivability Mechanical failure and the time required for repair were prime concerns.\n\n\nMaintenance\nChallenger 2 tanks require two sets of tools, as the hull is built using imperial measurements and the turret is built to metric measurements [56]\n\n\nOperational history\n [The tank was] well armoured but in an operational theatre it's not the case that you can have absolute protection This was not in any way new technology – the device involved was the same type of shaped charge that we have seen used very regularly No one has ever said Challenger tanks are impenetrable We have always said that a big enough bomb will defeat any armour and any vehicle.\n\nUpgrades\nThe Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme (CLIP) was a programme to replace the current L30A1 rifled gun with the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams The use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed Challenger 2 to use NATO standard ammunition, including tungsten-based kinetic energy penetrators which do not have the same political and environmental objections as depleted uranium rounds The production lines for rifled 120 mm ammunition in the UK have been closed for some years so existing stocks of ammunition for the L30A1 are finite [76]\n\n\nCLIP\nThe Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme (CLIP) was a programme to replace the current L30A1 rifled gun with the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used

main battle tank designed and manufactured by Vickers Defence Systems (now BAE Systems Land and Armaments). It is the third vehicle to bear the Challenger name, following the A30 Challenger, a World War II design, and the Challenger 1, a Persian Gulf War-era tank. The Challenger 2 was designed to replace the Challenger 1 and has been in service with the British Army since 1998. It is a heavily armoured and well-protected tank, equipped with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun and a digital fire control computer.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Challenger 1 was the British Army's main battle tank from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. However, it was deemed insufficient for modern warfare, and the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) initiated a programme to develop a new main battle tank, which would eventually become the Challenger 2. The Challenger 2 was designed to be more advanced and capable than its predecessor, with improved armour, firepower, and mobility.\n\n**Challenger 1**\n\nThe Challenger 1 was a significant improvement over its predecessor, the Challenger 1 was an upgrade of the earlier Chieftain tank. It was designed to be more powerful and better protected than the Chieftain, with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) gun and a more advanced fire control system. The Challenger 1 saw action in the Gulf War, where it performed well and showed its capabilities. However, it was still considered outdated by the mid-1990s and was eventually replaced by the Challenger 2.\n\n**Challenger 2 Contest**\n\nAs Challenger production ramped up, the government was interested in marketing it to its traditional customers, such as Jordan. To improve its sales prospects, the tank was entered in the 1987 running of the Canadian Army Trophy for tank performance. However, the Challenger performed poorly, with its units ending up at the bottom of the rankings. Despite this, the MoD remained committed to the project, and the Challenger 2 was eventually introduced into service.\n\n**Prototypes**\n\nVickers received a £90 million contract for a demonstrator vehicle to be delivered by September 1990. Part of this proof-of-concept phase was the demonstration that a depleted uranium projectile and more powerful gunpowder charge could be developed for the updated \"CHARM\" 120-millimetre gun. The demonstration phase had three milestones for progress, with dates of September 1989, March 1990, and September 1990.\n\n**Production and Delivery**\n\nIn June 1991, the decision to buy Challenger 2 was made formal with a £520 million contract for 127 tanks and 13 driver training tanks. Production began in 1993 at two primary sites, Elswick, Tyne and Wear, and Barnbow, Leeds, with over 250 subcontractors involved. The first tanks were delivered in July 1994, and the Challenger 2 was formally accepted on 16 May 1994.\n\n**Later Developments and Possible Replacement**\n\nThe Challenger 2 entered service with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, with the last delivered in 2002. After the Army 2020 restructuring, only three Challenger 2 Tank Regiments will remain: the Queen's Royal Hussars, the King's Royal Hussars, and the Royal Tank Regiment. A single Army Reserve regiment, The Royal Wessex Yeomanry, will provide reservist Challenger crews to the regular regiments.\n\n**Supply to Ukraine**\n\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the then British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, declined Ukrainian requests for Challenger 2 tanks to be part of the military aid packages arranged by the United Kingdom and other NATO countries. British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had said that the idea \"wouldn't work.\"\n\n**Design**\n\nThe Challenger 2 is equipped with a 120-millimetre (4.7 in) 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1. The gun is made from high-strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining. Like earlier British 120-millimetre guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve. It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilisation system.\n\n**Fire Control and Sights**\n\nThe digital fire control computer from Computing Devices Co of Canada contains two 32-bit processors with a MIL STD1553B databus. It has capacity for additional systems, such as a Battlefield Information Control System.\n\n**Protection**\n\nThe Challenger 2 is a heavily armoured and well-protected tank. The turret and hull are protected by second-generation Chobham armour, also known as Dorchester, the details of which are classified but which is said to have a mass efficiency more than twice that of rolled homogeneous armour against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles.\n\n**Drive System**\n\nThe tank's drive system comprises a CV12-5C/6C engine, TN54E transmission, and a Torque converter.\n\n**Crew and Accommodation**\n\nThe British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew, including a loader, after risk analysis of the incorporation of an automatic loader suggested that autoloaders reduced battlefield survivability.\n\n**Maintenance**\n\nChallenger 2 tanks require two sets of tools, as the hull is built using imperial measurements and the turret is built to metric measurements.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nThe Challenger 2 has seen action in several conflicts, including the Gulf War and the Iraq War. It has performed well and has shown its capabilities as a main battle tank.\n\n**Upgrades**\n\nThe Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme (CLIP) was a programme to replace the current L30A1 rifled gun with the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams.\n\n**CRARRV**\n\nThe Challenger Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle (CRARRV) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the Challenger 1 hull, designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe Challenger 2 is operated by the British Army and has been exported to several countries, including Oman and Qatar.\n\n**Accidents and Incidents**\n\nThere have been several accidents and incidents involving the Challenger 2, including a crash in 2019 that killed two British soldiers.\n\n**Future Replacement**\n\nThe Challenger 2 is expected to be replaced by the Challenger 3 in the coming years. The Challenger 3 will feature several improvements over the Challenger 2, including a new engine and improved armour.\n\n**Vehicles on Display**\n\nSeveral Challenger 2 vehicles are on display in museums and other locations, including the Bovington Tank Museum in the United Kingdom.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe Challenger 2 has been featured in several films and television shows, including the 2014 film \"Fury\" and the 2019 film \"Tolkien\".\n\n**References**\n\nThis article is based on information from various sources, including the British Ministry of Defence and the manufacturer of the

this performance was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense, including in comments in the House of Commons, it was a serious blow to its sales prospects It also proved only marginally more reliable than

are not closely related [4] Their skulls are small, but sturdily built and moderately elongated, with narrow zygomatic arches The projections of the skull are well-developed, with the sagittal crest being particularly prominent in old animals.\n\n\nEcology\nCommon raccoon dogs are omnivores that feed on insects, rodents, amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, mollusks, crabs, sea urchins, human garbage, carrion, and eggs, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries [14] [15] [16] [17] Among the rodents targeted by common raccoon dogs, voles seem to predominate in swampy areas, but are replaced with gerbils in flatland areas such as Astrakhan Frogs are the most commonly taken amphibians; in the Voronezh region, they frequently eat fire-bellied toads, while European spadefoot toads are usually taken in Ukraine Common raccoon dogs are able to eat toads that have toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins [18] They prey on waterfowl, passerines, and migrating birds Grouse are commonly hunted in their introduced range, and many instances of pheasant predation are recorded in the Ussuri territory.\n\n\nDiet\nCommon raccoon dogs are omnivores that

pheasant predation are recorded in the Ussuri territory.\n\n\nPredators\nWolves are the main predators of common raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them in spring and summer, though attacks have been reported in autumn, too In Tatarstan, wolf predation can account for more than half of [18] dog deaths, while in northwestern Russia, it can amount to almost two-thirds Red foxes kill common raccoon dog pups, and have been known to bite adults to death.\n\n\nBehaviour\nThe mating season begins from early February to late April, depending on location Common raccoon dogs are monogamous animals, with pair formations usually occurring in autumn Captive males, however, have been known to mate with four or five females Males will fight briefly, but not fatally, for mates [3] Copulation occurs during the night, or at dawn, and typically will last 6–9 minutes [19] Estrus lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times Females enter estrus again after 20–24 days, even when pregnant.\n\n\nReproduction and development\nThe mating season begins from early February to late April, depending on location Common raccoon dogs are monogamous animals, with

failing to reach these fat levels usually do not survive the winter During their hibernation, their metabolism decreases by 25% In areas such as Primorsky Krai and their introduced range, common raccoon dogs hibernate only during severe snowstorms In December, their physical activity decreases once snow depth reaches 15–20 cm (5.9–7.9 in), and limit the range from their burrows to no more than 150–200 m (490–660 ft) Their daily activities increase during February when the females become receptive, and when food is more available [3]\n\n\nVocalizations\nCommon raccoon dogs are usually

raccoon dogs of the N p ussuriensis subspecies were introduced in 76 districts, territories, and republics of the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve their fur quality Primorye in the Russian Far East was the first region to be colonised, with individuals being transplanted from islands in the Sea of Japan By 1934, common raccoon dogs were introduced into Altai, the Northern Caucasus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan (then known as Kirgizia), Tatarstan, Kalinin (now Tver Oblast), Penza, and Orenburg regions In the following year, they were further introduced into Leningradsky District (Krasnodar Krai), Murmansk, Novosibirsk, and Bashkortostan.\n\n\nDiseases and parasites\nA virus similar to SARS-CoV was isolated from Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), a common raccoon dog, and humans working in

they are hunted at night using Laikas and mongrels In the 19th century, the Goldi and Oroch people fastened bells to the collars of their common raccoon dog hounds In their introduced range, common raccoon dogs are usually caught incidentally during hunts for other species Hunting with dogs is the most efficient method in common raccoon dog hunts, having success rates of 80–90%, as opposed to 8–10% with guns and 5–7% with traps Unless they retreat in their burrows, hunted common raccoon dogs can be quickly strangled by hunting dogs Traps are usually set at their burrows, along the shores of water bodies, and around marshes and ponds [3]\n\n\nFur use\nWhen used on clothing, the fur of the common raccoon dog is often called \"murmansky\" or \"tanuki\" fur In the United States, it is marketed as \"Asiatic raccoon\", and in Northern Europe as \"Finn raccoon\" [44] Generally, the quality of the pelt is based on the silkiness of the fur, as its physical appeal depends upon the guard hairs being erect, which is only possible in silkier furs Small common raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, common raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings Japanese raccoon dog pelts, though smaller than other geographic variants, are the most valued variety, with specimens from Amur and Heilongjiang coming close behind, while Korean and southern Chinese are the least valued [45] When raised in captivity, common raccoon dogs can produce 100 g (3.5 oz) of wool of slightly lesser quality than that of goats [3]\n\n\nMisrepresentation as artificial fur\nIn several widely publicized incidents, clothing advertised

It is a member of the raccoon dog genus (Nyctereutes) and is closely related to the true foxes (Vulpes). The Common Raccoon Dog is known for its distinctive appearance and behavior, and is considered an important species in various ecosystems.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Common Raccoon Dog has a body length of approximately 50-70 cm (20-28 in), with a tail length of 20-30 cm (8-12 in). Its weight ranges from 3-6 kg (7-13 lbs), with males being larger than females. The fur is thick and woolly, with a distinctive yellow-brown color on the back and white on the underside. The ears are long and pointed, and the eyes are dark brown.\n\nThe skull of the Common Raccoon Dog is small and sturdily built, with a moderate elongation. The zygomatic arches are narrow, and the projections of the skull are well-developed, with a prominent sagittal crest in older animals.\n\n**Ecology**\n\nThe Common Raccoon Dog is an omnivore, feeding on a wide variety of food sources including insects, rodents, amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, and mollusks. It also eats fruits, nuts, and berries, as well as human garbage and carrion. In some areas, the Common Raccoon Dog has been known to prey on waterfowl and passerines.\n\nIn swampy areas, voles are a common prey species, while in flatland areas such as Astrakhan, gerbils are more abundant. Frogs are a common prey species, and the Common Raccoon Dog is able to eat toads with toxic skin secretions by producing copious amounts of saliva to dilute the toxins.\n\n**Diet**\n\nThe Common Raccoon Dog is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a wide variety of food sources. Insects, rodents, and amphibians are common prey species, while fruits, nuts, and berries are also consumed. Human garbage and carrion are also eaten, and in some areas, the Common Raccoon Dog has been known to prey on waterfowl and passerines.\n\n**Predators**\n\nThe Common Raccoon Dog has several predators, including wolves, red foxes, and humans. Wolves are the main predator of the Common Raccoon Dog, killing large numbers in the spring and summer. Red foxes kill Common Raccoon Dog pups and have been known to attack adults.\n\n**Behaviour**\n\nThe Common Raccoon Dog is a monogamous species, with pair formations occurring in the autumn. Males will fight briefly for mates, but not fatally. Copulation occurs at night or at dawn, and typically lasts 6-9 minutes. Estrus lasts from a few hours to six days, during which females may mate up to five times. Females enter estrus again after 20-24 days, even when pregnant.\n\n**Reproduction and Development**\n\nThe Common Raccoon Dog is a monogamous species, with pair formations occurring in the autumn.
