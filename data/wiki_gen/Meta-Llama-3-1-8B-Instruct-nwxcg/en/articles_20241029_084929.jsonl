It took place on May 29, 2023, to elect members to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe electoral process in Alberta is governed by the Elections Act, which sets the rules and procedures for the conduct of elections. The Act requires that a general election be held at least once every four years on the 22nd day of April or first day of June in even-numbered years.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe electoral process in Alberta involves several key steps:\n\n1. Nomination period: A nomination period is established during which candidates can register to run in the election.\n2. Voting day: On the designated voting day, eligible voters cast their ballots at designated polling stations.\n3. Counting of ballots: The ballots are then counted at the polling stations, and the results are reported to the Chief Electoral Officer.\n4. Declaration of results: The Chief Electoral Officer declares the results of the election, and the winners are sworn in as members of the Legislative Assembly.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system in Alberta is a first-past-the-post system, in which the candidate with the most votes in a riding wins the seat. Each riding is represented by one member of the Legislative Assembly, and a total of 87 members are elected in the general election.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 2019\n\nThe 2019 Alberta general election took place on April 16, 2019. The election was marked by a significant shift in power, with the United Conservative Party (UCP) winning a majority of seats and the New Democratic Party (NDP) losing its majority.\n\n### 2020\n\nIn 2020, the UCP government passed several key pieces of legislation, including the Budget 2020 Act and the Education Act.

The NDP opposition criticized the bill, arguing that it would give too much power to the energy industry.\n\n### 2022\n\nIn 2022, the UCP government introduced Bill 11, the Public Health Act, which aimed to strengthen public health regulations and increase the power of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. The NDP opposition criticized the bill, arguing that it would give too much power to the government.\n\n### 2023\n\nThe 2023 Alberta general election took place on May 29, 2023.

The NDP opposition criticized the government's economic policies, arguing that they were too focused on the interests of the wealthy and would not benefit everyday Albertans.\n\n### Education\n\nThe NDP opposition criticized the UCP government's education policies, arguing that they were too focused on standardized testing and would not provide students with the skills they need to succeed. The UCP government responded by introducing several pieces of legislation aimed at improving education outcomes, including the Education Act.\n\n### Public safety\n\nThe NDP opposition criticized the UCP government's public safety policies, arguing that they were too focused on punishment and would not address the root causes of crime.

The row began as a dispute between Muslim students and the administration of a college in Udupi, which prohibited the wearing of hijabs, citing the institution's uniform policy. The ban was then extended to other colleges and institutions in the state, leading to widespread protests and violence.\n\n**Background**\n\nKarnataka is a state in southwestern India with a significant Muslim population. The state has a long history of communal tensions, particularly between Hindus and Muslims. In recent years, there have been several instances of violence and communal clashes in the state, often sparked by disputes over issues such as cow slaughter, temple entry, and dress codes.\n\nThe wearing of hijabs by Muslim women in educational institutions has been a contentious issue in India for several years. While some institutions have allowed students to wear hijabs, others have prohibited them, citing concerns about the uniform policy and the potential for religious divisions.\n\n**Events**\n\n### Udupi Dispute\n\nThe controversy began on January 2, 2022, when a group of Muslim students from the Government Pre-University College in Udupi, a town in the state's coastal region, were asked to remove their hijabs by the college administration. The students had been wearing hijabs as part of their uniform, but the administration claimed that the institution's uniform policy did not permit hijabs.\n\nThe students refused to remove their hijabs, citing their right to freedom of religion and expression. The administration, however, insisted that the uniform policy was necessary to maintain a secular and inclusive environment on campus. The dispute escalated over the next few days, with the students and their supporters holding protests and demonstrations outside the college.\n\n### Saffron Protests\n\nOn January 10, 2022, a group of Hindu activists, dressed in saffron robes, launched a counter-protest outside the college. The activists, who were affiliated with a local Hindu organization, chanted slogans and waved flags, demanding that the Muslim students remove their hijabs. The police were deployed to maintain order, but the situation remained tense.\n\n### Government Reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially remained neutral on the issue, urging both sides to resolve the dispute amicably. However, as the protests and violence escalated, the government was forced to take a firmer stance.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the government issued an order prohibiting the wearing of hijabs in all educational institutions in the state. The order, which was seen as a concession to the Hindu activists, sparked widespread outrage among Muslim students and their supporters.\n\n### Fallout\n\nThe government's order led to a wave of protests and demonstrations across the state, with Muslim students and their supporters demanding that the order be repealed. The protests turned violent in some areas, with clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups.\n\nThe controversy also had a significant impact on the state's education system, with many colleges and institutions suspending classes and cancelling exams. The state government was criticized for its handling of the crisis, with many accusing it of favoring one community over the other.\n\n**Petitions in the High Court**\n\n### Religious Rights\n\nOn January 17, 2022, a group of Muslim students filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court, challenging the government's order prohibiting the wearing of hijabs. The petitioners, who were represented by a leading Muslim lawyer, argued that the order was a violation of their fundamental right to freedom of religion and expression.\n\n### Government Order\n\nThe government, in its response to the petition, argued that the order was necessary to maintain a secular and inclusive environment in educational institutions. The government also claimed that the wearing of hijabs was not an essential part of the Muslim faith and that the order was not a targeted attack on the Muslim community.\n\n### College Development Committees\n\nThe government also argued that the college development committees, which were responsible for framing the uniform policy, had the authority to prohibit the wearing of hijabs. The committees, which were dominated by Hindus, had been instrumental in framing the uniform policy that prohibited hijabs.\n\n### Udupi College and Other Institutions\n\nThe controversy also raised questions about the autonomy of educational institutions and the role of government in regulating their affairs. The Udupi college, which had initially prohibited the wearing of hijabs, was criticized for its handling of the crisis. The college's governing body, which was dominated by Hindus, had been instrumental in framing the uniform policy that prohibited hijabs.\n\n**High Court Verdict**\n\nOn February 11, 2022, the Karnataka High Court delivered a verdict on the petition filed by the Muslim students. The court, in a split decision, ruled that the government's order prohibiting the wearing of hijabs was unconstitutional. The court held that the order was a violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion and expression.\n\nHowever, the court also ruled that the wearing of hijabs was not an essential part of the Muslim faith and that the order was not a targeted attack on the Muslim community. The court's verdict was seen as a victory for the Muslim students and their supporters.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\nThe Karnataka government, represented by the Attorney General of India, filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court's verdict. The Supreme Court, in a two-judge bench, stayed the High Court's verdict, allowing the government's order prohibiting the wearing of hijabs to remain in force.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision was seen as a setback for the Muslim students and their supporters. The court's order also sparked widespread outrage among Muslim groups, who accused the court of favoring the Hindu majority.\n\n**Violence**\n\nThe controversy also had a significant impact on the state's social fabric, with widespread violence and communal clashes reported in several areas. The police were deployed to maintain order, but the situation remained tense.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\nThe controversy sparked widespread reactions among Indian politicians and activists. The opposition parties, including the Congress and the Left, accused the government of favoring the Hindu majority and violating the fundamental rights of Muslim students.\n\nThe ruling BJP, however, defended its handling of the crisis, saying that the government had taken a firm stance against the Muslim students who were refusing to remove their hijabs. The party also accused the opposition parties of politicizing the issue and fueling communal tensions.\n\n### International\n\nThe controversy also sparked reactions among international human rights groups and diplomatic missions. The United States, the European Union, and the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) expressed concern over the government's handling of the crisis and the potential for human rights violations.\n\n**Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)**\n\nThe Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) defended the government's handling of the crisis, saying that the government had taken a firm stance against the Muslim students who were refusing to remove their hijabs. The MEA also accused the international community of interfering in India's internal affairs and fueling communal tensions.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe controversy had a significant impact on the state's education system, with many colleges and institutions suspending classes and cancelling exams. The state government was criticized for its handling of the crisis, with many accusing it of favoring one community over the other.\n\nThe controversy also had a significant impact on the state's social fabric, with widespread violence and communal clashes reported in several areas. The police were deployed to maintain order, but the situation remained tense.\n\n**Rescission**\n\nOn March 11, 2022, the Karnataka government, under pressure from the Supreme Court, rescinded its order prohibiting the wearing of hijabs in educational institutions. The government's decision was seen as a victory for the Muslim students and their supporters.\n\nThe controversy, however, raised questions about the potential for communal tensions and the need for greater dialogue and understanding between different communities. The incident also highlighted the need for greater sensitivity and awareness about the rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of their community, caste, or creed.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Muslim women in India\n* Hijab in India\n* Freedom of religion in India\n* Communal violence in India\n* Education in India\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been verified by independent sources.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"2022 Karnataka hijab row: A timeline\".

Situated in the north-east of the country, it covered a vast territory that included the modern-day county of Durham and parts of Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. This article explores the history, administration, and legacy of the County Palatine of Durham, highlighting its distinct features and significance in the medieval period.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was a creation of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The region had previously been a powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom, known as the Kingdom of Northumbria, which had been divided into several smaller territories by the 9th century. The Normans, led by William the Conqueror, sought to consolidate their power and establish a new administrative system. The County Palatine of Durham was one of several palatine counties established in England, each with its own unique characteristics and privileges.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early History\n\nThe early history of the County Palatine of Durham is closely tied to the Kingdom of Northumbria. The region had been an important center of power and learning, with the famous Lindisfarne Gospels being created in the 7th century. However, by the 9th century, Northumbria had been divided into several smaller territories, including the Kingdom of Bernicia, which covered much of the modern-day county of Durham. The Kingdom of Bernicia was a powerful and influential state, known for its rich cultural and artistic heritage.\n\n### Establishment and Consolidation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was established by William the Conqueror in 1071, following the Norman Conquest of England. The new county was created from the territory of the Kingdom of Bernicia, which had been weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures. The County Palatine of Durham was granted to the Bishop of Durham, William Walcher, who became the first Bishop-Palatine of Durham. The bishopric was a powerful institution, with control over a vast territory and significant administrative and judicial powers.\n\n### Decline and Abolition\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham began to decline in the 13th century, as the power of the English monarchy grew. The county's unique privileges and powers were eroded, and it became increasingly subject to central government control. In 1333, the County Palatine of Durham was formally abolished, and its powers were transferred to the English crown. The bishopric of Durham continued to exist, but its authority was significantly reduced.\n\n**Administration**\n\n### Taxation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of taxation, which was separate from the rest of England. The county was required to pay a significant amount of revenue to the English crown, known as the \"duty of the county.\" This revenue was used to support the English monarchy and fund its military campaigns. In addition to the duty of the county, the County Palatine of Durham also had its own system of local taxation, which was used to fund local infrastructure and services.\n\n### Government and Courts\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of government and courts, which were separate from the rest of England. The bishop of Durham was the head of government in the county, and had significant powers and privileges. The county was divided into several smaller jurisdictions, each with its own court and administrative system. The County Palatine of Durham also had its own system of law, which was based on the English common law, but with significant modifications and additions.\n\n**St Cuthbert and the Haliwerfolc**\n\nSt Cuthbert was a 7th-century saint who played a significant role in the history of the County Palatine of Durham. He was a bishop of Lindisfarne, and was known for his piety and wisdom. The Haliwerfolc were a group of monks who lived on the island of Lindisfarne, and were dedicated to the service of St Cuthbert. The Haliwerfolc were known for their learning and their artistic skills, and were responsible for the creation of the famous Lindisfarne Gospels.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had a significant legacy in the medieval period.

The movement has since spread to other platforms, including social media, podcasts, and online forums. At its core, QAnon revolves around the idea that a deep state, known as \"the cabal,\" is secretly controlling the world and that a hidden figure, known as \"Q,\" is working to expose and dismantle this conspiracy.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Pizzagate\n\nThe Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged in 2016, is often cited as a precursor to QAnon. Pizzagate posited that a child sex trafficking ring was operating out of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., and that Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking officials were involved. Although the theory was thoroughly debunked, it helped lay the groundwork for the more elaborate and sinister conspiracy theories that would follow.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n\n4chan, a website known for its anonymous posting and lax moderation, has long been a breeding ground for conspiracy theories and far-right ideologies. The website's users, often referred to as \"anons,\" have a history of creating and promoting their own conspiracy theories, often using cryptic language and symbols. QAnon's use of coded language and references to 4chan culture has been attributed to this influence.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\n\nOther notable \"anons\" have emerged over the years, often with similar characteristics to QAnon. These include Project Camelot, a conspiracy theory surrounding the alleged cover-up of extraterrestrial life, and the \" Bilderberg Group\" conspiracy theory, which posits that a secret society of powerful individuals is controlling global events.\n\n**Origin and spread**\n\n### Mainstream attention\n\nQAnon first gained mainstream attention in 2017, when it began to trend on social media platforms. The movement's rapid growth and spread were largely facilitated by the proliferation of far-right online communities, as well as the increasing popularity of conspiracy theories on platforms such as Reddit and 4chan.\n\n### International following\n\nQAnon has since spread to other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The movement has been particularly popular in the United States, where it has been linked to several high-profile incidents, including a failed coup attempt in Oregon in 2020.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\n\nIn 2020, a variant of QAnon emerged, characterized by its use of pastel-colored graphics and a more family-friendly tone. This variant, often referred to as \"Pastel QAnon,\" has been seen as a way for QAnon adherents to present a more palatable and less extreme version of the movement.\n\n**Claims**\n\n### Q's posts\n\nQ's posts, often referred to as \"QDrops,\" are a key component of the QAnon movement. Q's posts are typically cryptic, using coded language and references to 4chan culture.

The election was contested by incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who was seeking a third term in office, and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2023 presidential election was the 14th presidential election in the history of the Republic of Turkey. It followed the 2018 Turkish presidential election, in which Erdoğan was re-elected with 52.6% of the vote.\n\n**2018 elections**\n\nThe 2018 presidential election was a significant event in Turkish politics, as it marked the transition from a parliamentary system to a presidential system. The election was contested by Erdoğan, who was running for a second term, and Muharrem İnce, the CHP candidate. Erdoğan won the election with 52.6% of the vote, while İnce received 30.6%. The election was marked by controversy, with allegations of voter fraud and pressure on opposition candidates.\n\n**Date**\n\n**Discussion on snap elections**\n\nThere were ongoing discussions about holding snap elections in Turkey, with some opposition parties calling for an early election.

The event was the 39th edition of the World Women's Curling Championship.\n\n# Qualification\n\nThe qualification process for the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship involved several countries competing in regional events to secure a spot in the tournament. The qualification process was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to some countries withdrawing from the competition or having their teams affected by the virus.\n\n## Russian participation\n\nDue to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the World Curling Federation (WCF) decided to exclude Russia from the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. The decision was made in consultation with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WCF Executive Board.\n\n## COVID-19 issues\n\nSeveral countries experienced COVID-19 issues during the qualification process, which affected their participation in the tournament. Some teams had to withdraw from the competition due to positive cases or close contacts, while others were forced to isolate or quarantine.\n\n### Scotland\n\nThe Scottish Curling Team, which was competing in the European Qualification Event, was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to positive cases of COVID-19. The team had to quarantine for 10 days, which meant they missed the qualification event and were unable to participate in the World Championship.\n\n### Japan\n\nThe Japanese Curling Team, which was also competing in the European Qualification Event, had to withdraw due to close contacts with a player who had tested positive for COVID-19. The team was forced to isolate for several days and was unable to participate in the qualification event.\n\n# Teams\n\nA total of 13 teams competed in the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship. The teams were ranked according to their performance in the previous season's World Curling Tour.\n\n## WCF ranking\n\nThe WCF ranking system is used to determine the seeding and qualification process for the World Women's Curling Championship. The ranking is based on a team's performance in the previous season's World Curling Tour, including the World Curling Championship and the Grand Slam events.\n\n| Rank | Team | Country |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Canada | Canada |\n| 2 | Sweden | Sweden |\n| 3 | Switzerland | Switzerland |\n| 4 | Scotland | Scotland |\n| 5 | United States | United States |\n| 6 | Japan | Japan |\n| 7 | Denmark | Denmark |\n| 8 | South Korea | South Korea |\n| 9 | China | China |\n| 10 | Germany | Germany |\n| 11 | Czech Republic | Czech Republic |\n| 12 | Latvia | Latvia |\n| 13 | Turkey | Turkey |\n\n# Rule changes\n\nFor the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship, the WCF introduced several rule changes to the game of curling. The changes were designed to improve the speed and flow of the game, while also reducing the risk of injury to players.\n\nOne of the main rule changes was the introduction of a \"sweeping clock,\" which limits the amount of time teams have to sweep the stone. The clock is designed to prevent teams from sweeping for too long, which can lead to fatigue and injury.\n\nAnother rule change was the introduction of a \"slow-motion\" review system, which allows teams to review certain calls made by the referees. The system is designed to help teams make informed decisions and reduce the risk of error.\n\n# Round-robin standings\n\nThe round-robin standings for the 2022 World Women's Curling Championship were as follows:\n\n| Rank | Team | Wins | Losses | Points |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Canada | 11 | 0 | 22 |\n| 2 | Switzerland | 8 | 3 | 19 |\n| 3 | Sweden | 8 | 3 | 19 |\n| 4 | Scotland |

Founded in 1983 by Robert T. Hamilton, the bank was headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and was one of the largest banks in the United States by asset size at the time of its collapse.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a key player in the technology industry, providing a range of financial services to startups, venture capital firms, and other companies in the sector. The bank's collapse in March 2023 sent shockwaves through the financial markets, highlighting the risk of the bank's business model and the interconnectedness of the global financial system.\n\n**Foundation and early growth**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Robert T. Hamilton, a former investment banker who recognized the need for specialized financial services in the burgeoning technology industry. Initially, the bank focused on providing loans and other financial services to startups and small businesses in the Silicon Valley region. In the early 1990s, the bank expanded its operations to the San Francisco Bay Area and began to attract more clients from the technology and life science sectors.\n\nDuring the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, SVB experienced rapid growth, with assets increasing from $1.2 billion in 1998 to $11.7 billion in 2000. The bank's success during this period was largely driven by its ability to provide innovative financial products and services to the technology industry, including venture capital financing and equipment leasing.\n\n**Expansion**\n\nIn the early 2000s, SVB began to expand its operations beyond the San Francisco Bay Area, opening branches in other major technology hubs such as Boston, New York City, and Seattle. The bank also invested in a range of technology platforms and systems, including online banking and mobile banking services, to enhance its customer experience.\n\nDuring this period, SVB also underwent a significant transformation, shifting its focus from traditional banking services to a more specialized approach that catered to the needs of the technology industry. The bank invested heavily in research and development, establishing a range of innovation labs and partnerships with technology companies to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n**Operations in lead-up to collapse**\n\n### Business model\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's business model was centered around providing specialized financial services to the technology and life science industries. The bank's clients included startups, venture capital firms, and other companies in the sector, as well as research institutions and universities.\n\nThe bank's services included venture capital financing, equipment leasing, and cash management, as well as a range of other financial products and services tailored to the needs of the technology industry. SVB also provided a range of advisory services to its clients, including guidance on fundraising, mergers and acquisitions, and other strategic matters.\n\n### Facilities\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Silicon Valley Bank had a network of 13 branches in the United States, as well as a range of online and mobile banking services. The bank's headquarters was located in Santa Clara, California, and it also had a significant presence in other major technology hubs such as Boston, New York City, and Seattle.\n\n### Affiliations and community involvement\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a member of the Federal Reserve System and was regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The bank was also a member of the Bank Administration Institute and the American Bankers Association.\n\nSVB was also actively involved in the local community, supporting a range of organizations and initiatives in the technology and life science sectors. The bank was a major sponsor of the annual TechCrunch Disrupt conference and was also a partner of the Stanford University Office of Technology Licensing.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it had sold a portion of its asset-backed securities portfolio to a third-party investor at a loss. The bank also announced that it would be suspending its dividend payments to shareholders.\n\nIn the following days, SVB's shares plummeted, falling by more than 60% in a single trading session. On March 13, 2023, the bank announced that it would be seeking to raise capital to address its liquidity crisis.\n\nHowever, despite the bank's efforts to raise capital, SVB was unable to recover from its liquidity crisis. On March 16, 2023, the bank announced that it would be sold to a group of investors led by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sent shockwaves through the financial markets, highlighting the risk of the bank's business model and the interconnectedness of the global financial system.\n\n**References**\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank: A History\" by Robert T.

During this period, Roman surgeons and physicians made significant contributions to the field, building on the knowledge and techniques of their Greek predecessors.\n\nIn the early days of Roman medicine, surgery was often performed by physicians who were also trained in philosophy and the arts. These early surgeons were often called \"medici,\" and they treated a wide range of medical conditions using a combination of herbal remedies, surgical procedures, and spiritual interventions. As Roman medicine evolved, surgeons began to specialize in specific areas, such as dentistry, ophthalmology, and surgery.\n\nDuring the height of the Roman Empire, surgery became a respected and highly skilled profession. Roman surgeons developed new techniques and instruments, and they began to write extensively on medical topics. The works of Galen, a prominent Roman physician and surgeon, had a profound impact on the development of surgery in ancient Rome.\n\n# Tools\n\nRoman surgeons used a wide range of tools and instruments to perform various surgical procedures.

These communities developed distinct cultural, linguistic, and artistic traditions that blended Greek and African elements.\n\n# Ancient Egypt\n\n## First Historical Colonies\n\nThe earliest recorded Greek presence in Africa dates back to the 6th century BC, when Greek colonists from the city-state of Naucratis founded the first Greek colony in Egypt, near the city of Sais. This colony served as a hub for trade and cultural exchange between Egypt and the rest of the Mediterranean world. The Greek colonists brought with them their language, customs, and traditions, which gradually influenced the local Egyptian population.\n\n## Hellenistic Times\n\nThe Ptolemaic period, following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, saw a significant influx of Greek migrants to Egypt. The Ptolemaic dynasty, founded by Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian general, established a Greek-style government and promoted the spread of Greek culture throughout the region. Many Greeks settled in cities such as Alexandria, which became a center of Hellenistic culture and learning. The Ptolemaic period saw the development of a distinct Greek-Egyptian identity, with many Egyptians adopting Greek customs and language.\n\n### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nAlexander the Great's conquest of Egypt in 332 BC marked the beginning of a new era of Greek influence in the region. Alexander's vision for a unified Mediterranean world, with Greek culture at its core, inspired many Greeks to migrate to Egypt. During this period, Greek language and culture became increasingly prominent, with many Egyptians adopting Greek names and customs. The city of Alexandria, founded by Alexander, became a major center of Greek culture and learning, attracting scholars and intellectuals from across the Mediterranean.\n\n### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nThe Ptolemaic Empire, founded by Ptolemy I Soter, saw the establishment of a Greek-style government and the promotion of Greek culture throughout Egypt. Many Greeks settled in cities such as Alexandria, which became a hub for trade, culture, and learning. The Ptolemaic period saw the development of a distinct Greek-Egyptian identity, with many Egyptians adopting Greek customs and language. The Ptolemaic dynasty also saw the construction of many monumental buildings, including the Great Library of Alexandria, which became a center of learning and scholarship.\n\n## Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\nFollowing the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, Egypt became a Roman province, and the Greek language and culture continued to thrive. During the Roman period, many Greeks continued to migrate to Egypt, and the city of Alexandria remained a major center of Greek culture and learning. The Byzantine period, which followed the rise of Christianity, saw the spread of Christianity throughout Egypt, and many Greeks converted to the new faith. The Byzantine period also saw the decline of the Greek language and culture, as Arabic became the dominant language and culture in the region.\n\n### Coptic Greeks\n\nThe Coptic Greeks, also known as the Copto-Hellenes, were a distinct group of people who lived in Egypt during the Roman and Byzantine periods. They were the descendants of Greek migrants who had settled in Egypt and had adopted the Coptic Christian faith. The Coptic Greeks maintained many of their Greek traditions and customs, but also adopted some Coptic practices and language. The Coptic Greeks played an important role in the spread of Christianity throughout Egypt and were known for their distinctive culture and traditions.\n\n# Ancient Ethiopia\n\n## Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumite Empire, which flourished from the 1st century BC to the 8th century AD, saw the rise of a distinct Axumite culture that blended Ethiopian and Greek traditions. The Axumites, who were the rulers of the empire, adopted many Greek customs and language and established trade and cultural links with the Mediterranean world. Many Greeks settled in Axum, which became a major center of trade and culture. The Axumites also built many monumental buildings, including the famous Stele of Axum, which is a testament to the Axumite's skill in stone carving.\n\n## Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks, also known as the Habasho-Ellinon, were a distinct group of people who lived in Ethiopia during the Axumite period.

The film is based on the iconic fashion doll of the same name and stars Margot Robbie as Barbie. The movie follows the story of Barbie, a doll who comes to life and navigates the complexities of the real world. The film was released in theaters on July 21, 2023, and has since become a cultural phenomenon.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of Barbie (Margot Robbie), a doll who is living in a perfect world filled with perfect people and perfect houses. However, when Barbie is dropped into the real world, she discovers that it is not as perfect as she thought. She meets a group of women who are struggling with their own identities and self-esteem, and together they embark on a journey of self-discovery and empowerment.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken (Ryan Gosling), Barbie's on-again, off-again boyfriend, is struggling with his own identity crisis. He is torn between his desire to be a successful businessman and his desire to be a stay-at-home dad. As Barbie navigates the complexities of the real world, she finds herself drawn to Ken's vulnerability and authenticity.\n\nThroughout the film, Barbie and Ken's relationship is put to the test as they face challenges and obstacles that threaten to tear them apart. However, ultimately, they emerge stronger and more in love than ever before.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including:\n\n* Margot Robbie as Barbie\n* Ryan Gosling as Ken\n* America Ferrera as Gloria\n* Simu Liu as Alan\n* Kate McKinnon as Barbara Millicent Roberts\n* Will Ferrell as CEO of Mattel\n* Ariana Greenblatt as young Barbie\n* Michael Cera as young Ken\n\n**Production**\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea for the film was first conceived in 2016, when Margot Robbie and Tom Ackerley, her producing partner, acquired the rights to the Barbie franchise. Robbie has long been a fan of the doll and saw an opportunity to create a film that would appeal to a wide range of audiences.\n\n**Writing**\n\nThe script for the film was written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Gerwig, who is known for her work on films like Lady Bird and Little Women, was brought on board to bring a feminine perspective to the project. Baumbach, who has written for films like The Grand Budapest Hotel and Marriage Story, was brought in to add a touch of wit and humor to the script.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe casting process for the film was a long and arduous one. Margot Robbie was the first actor to be cast, and she was followed by Ryan Gosling, who was cast as Ken. The rest of the cast was assembled over the course of several months, with America Ferrera and Simu Liu joining the film in the spring of 2022.\n\n**Set design**\n\nThe set design for the film was a key aspect of the production. The team built an entire town, called Willows, Wisconsin, which served as the backdrop for the film. The set was designed to be a mix of old and new, with a nod to the classic American suburbs of the 1950s and 60s.\n\n**Costumes, hair, and makeup**\n\nThe costumes for the film were designed by Jacqueline Durran, who is known for her work on films like Pride and Prejudice and The Great Gatsby. The costumes were a mix of period-perfect and modern, with a focus on bright colors and bold patterns.\n\nThe hair and makeup for the film were designed by Mareille Hahlbrock, who is known for her work on films like The Grand Budapest Hotel and The Favourite. The hair and makeup were a key aspect of the film's overall aesthetic, with a focus on natural looks and minimal makeup.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe filming for the film took place over the course of several months, with a team of over 200 crew members working on the production. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with a mix of interior and exterior scenes.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nThe post-production process for the film was a long and laborious one. The team spent several months editing the film, with a focus on creating a seamless and engaging narrative. The film was also scored by Mark Ronson, who is known for his work on films like The Grand Budapest Hotel and Lady Bird.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for the film was a key aspect of the production. The team created a bespoke soundtrack for the film, which featured a mix of classic songs and original compositions. The soundtrack was released in conjunction with the film's release and features a range of artists, including Dua Lipa and Charli XCX.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film was a major undertaking, with a team of over 100 people working on the promotion of the film.

Despite the relative rarity of such events, the deaths of federal judges have had significant political and logistical consequences, and have often been notable for their dramatic circumstances.\n\n# Background\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is responsible for interpreting the laws and Constitution of the United States, and is composed of the Supreme Court of the United States and the United States Courts of Appeals, the United States District Courts, and the United States Bankruptcy Courts. Federal judges are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate, and serve for life terms unless they resign or are impeached and removed from office.\n\nFederal judges are responsible for hearing a wide range of cases, including civil and criminal trials, appeals, and other types of proceedings. They are also responsible for deciding cases on a wide range of issues, including constitutional law, contract law, tort law, and other areas of law. Despite the significant power and responsibility of federal judges, they are not immune to death, and have died in office on numerous occasions throughout the history of the federal judiciary.\n\n# Political consequences\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service have had significant political consequences, both during the lifetime of the judge and after their death. When a federal judge dies in office, the President of the United States typically nominates a replacement, who must then be confirmed by the United States Senate. This process can be contentious, particularly if the nominee has a controversial record or is opposed by one or more Senate committees.\n\nIn some cases, the death of a federal judge has led to significant changes in the balance of power on the Supreme Court or other federal courts. For example, the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 led to a prolonged and contentious process to fill his seat, which was eventually filled by Judge Neil Gorsuch. In other cases, the death of a federal judge has led to significant changes in the direction of the court, as a new judge brings their own perspectives and opinions to the bench.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also have significant political consequences for the President who appointed them. If the judge was a significant ally or supporter of the President, their death can be seen as a loss for the President, and can be used by opponents to argue that the President's judicial appointments are not effective. On the other hand, if the judge was a significant critic or opponent of the President, their death can be seen as a victory for the President, and can be used by supporters to argue that the President's judicial appointments are effective.\n\n# Logistical consequences\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service have also had significant logistical consequences, particularly for the courts and the parties involved in cases before the court. When a federal judge dies, the court must be notified and arrangements must be made to continue the proceedings. In some cases, this may involve the appointment of a new judge to take over the case, while in other cases it may involve the continuation of the proceedings by a different judge or a panel of judges.\n\nThe death of a federal judge can also have significant logistical consequences for the parties involved in the case. If the case was nearing a resolution, the death of the judge may cause delays or disruptions to the proceedings. In some cases, the parties may need to seek new counsel or make new arrangements to continue the case. In other cases, the death of the judge may lead to the dismissal of the case or the abandonment of certain claims or defenses.\n\n# Lists\n\n## 1789–1869\n\nThe following is a list of federal judges who died in active service between 1789 and 1869:\n\n* William Cushing, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1789–1810)\n* James Wilson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1789–1798)\n* James Iredell, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1790–1799)\n* William Paterson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1793–1806)\n* James Wilson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1797–1798)\n* Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1796–1811)\n* William Howard Tipton, District Judge (1823–1832)\n* Samuel Nelson, District Judge (1823–1843)\n* Joseph Story, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1812–1845)\n* Smith Thompson, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1823–1843)\n* Henry Baldwin, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1830–1844)\n* William Cranch, Circuit Judge (1801–1811)\n* Samuel Chase, Circuit Judge (1797–1811)\n* William Wirt, Attorney General of the United States (1817–1829)\n\n## 1870–1919\n\nThe following is a list of federal judges who died in active service between 1870 and 1919:\n\n* Morrison Waite, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1874–1888)\n* Stephen Field, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1863–1897)\n* Joseph Bradley, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1870–1892)\n* John Harlan, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1877–1911)\n* Horace Gray, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1882–1902)\n* William Howard Taft, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1909–1930)\n* John Marshall Harlan, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1877–1911)\n* Charles Evans Hughes, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1910–1916)\n* William R.

The protests were sparked by a severe economic crisis, which led to widespread shortages of essential goods, including food, medicine, and fuel. The crisis was exacerbated by a debt crisis, which had led to a significant decline in foreign exchange reserves and a subsequent collapse of the rupee. The protests were marked by violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces, as well as by attempts to occupy government buildings and disrupt the functioning of state institutions.\n\n**Background**\n\nSri Lanka's economic crisis began in 2019, when the country's foreign exchange reserves began to decline due to a combination of factors, including a reduction in foreign investment, a decline in tourism, and a significant increase in imports. The crisis was exacerbated by a drought in 2020, which reduced agricultural production and led to a shortage of food. In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic further worsened the economic situation, as tourism and remittances declined significantly.\n\nIn 2022, the economic crisis deepened, with the rupee experiencing a significant decline in value against the US dollar, and food and fuel prices rising sharply. The government's efforts to address the crisis, including the imposition of taxes and the introduction of austerity measures, were met with widespread opposition from the public.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### March\n\nThe first protests began in mid-March 2022, when a group of students and civil society activists gathered in front of the Parliament building in Colombo, the capital city, to demand action from the government to address the economic crisis. The protests were initially peaceful, but soon turned violent as police attempted to disperse the crowd.\n\n### April\n\n#### Declaration of state of emergency\n\nOn April 1, 2022, the government declared a state of emergency, which gave the military and police sweeping powers to arrest and detain individuals suspected of involvement in the protests. The declaration was met with widespread criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.\n\n#### Social media blocks\n\nOn April 2, 2022, the government blocked access to social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, in an attempt to prevent the spread of information about the protests. The move was widely criticized by civil society groups and opposition politicians.\n\n#### Cabinet resignation\n\nOn April 3, 2022, the entire cabinet of ministers resigned, citing the economic crisis and the government's inability to address it.

The season officially began on May 15, 2023, and ended on November 30, 2023.\n\n**Seasonal Forecasts**\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations released seasonal forecasts for the 2023 Pacific hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted a below-average season, with 8-12 named storms, 4-7 hurricanes, and 1-3 major hurricanes. The Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) forecast also predicted a below-average season, with 7-10 named storms, 3-5 hurricanes, and 1-2 major hurricanes. The International Research Institute (IRI) forecast predicted a slightly above-average season, with 9-14 named storms, 5-8 hurricanes, and 2-4 major hurricanes.\n\n**Seasonal Summary**\n\nThe 2023 Pacific hurricane season was characterized by a slightly above-average number of named storms, with 14 systems reaching tropical storm strength or higher. The season was also notable for its relatively low number of major hurricanes, with only two systems reaching Category 3 intensity or higher.\n\n### Background\n\nThe 2023 Pacific hurricane season was influenced by a number of climate patterns, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the summer months, a moderate El Niño event developed in the Pacific Ocean, which contributed to a decrease in tropical activity in the Eastern Pacific. However, by the fall months, the El Niño event had weakened, and a more neutral ENSO phase developed, which contributed to an increase in tropical activity.\n\n### Early Activity\n\nThe first named storm of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season was Hurricane Adrian, which formed on May 31, 2023. Adrian was a Category 2 hurricane at its peak intensity, and made landfall in Mexico on June 3, 2023, causing significant damage and flooding.\n\n**Systems**\n\nA total of 14 named storms formed during the 2023 Pacific hurricane season.

The season officially started on November 1, 2021, and ended on June 30, 2022.\n\nThe South Pacific cyclone season is the term used to describe the cyclone season in the region south of the equator, between 160°E and 120°W. The region is prone to tropical cyclones due to its warm ocean waters and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).\n\n**Seasonal forecasts**\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several organizations issued forecasts and predictions for the number and intensity of tropical cyclones that would form during the season. The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) issued a cyclone watch for the South Pacific, warning of a higher than normal risk of tropical cyclones forming during the season.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) also issued a tropical cyclone outlook for the region, predicting a higher than normal chance of tropical cyclones forming during the season. The BOM predicted that the season would be influenced by a strong El Niño event, which would bring above-average sea surface temperatures and increased atmospheric instability to the region.\n\n**Seasonal summary**\n\nThe 2021–22 South Pacific cyclone season was a relatively active season, with 14 tropical cyclones forming during the season. The season was influenced by a strong El Niño event, which brought above-average sea surface temperatures and increased atmospheric instability to the region.\n\nThe season began on November 1, 2021, with the formation of Tropical Disturbance 01F, a tropical disturbance that formed to the north of Fiji.

The 2022 experiment was met with widespread enthusiasm, with users participating in record numbers. The artwork produced during this period was more complex and intricate than its predecessor, showcasing the growth and evolution of the Reddit community.\n\n##2023 experiment\n\nThe 2023 iteration of R/place was announced in early 2023, building on the success of the previous two experiments.

However, with the advent of high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) display technologies, the number of pixels on the screen has increased dramatically. Today, display resolution standards range from low-resolution standards like VGA to high-resolution standards like 8K UHD.\n\n**Aspect Ratio**\n\nThe aspect ratio of a display is the ratio of its width to its height. Aspect ratios can vary, but the most common aspect ratios are 4:3, 16:9, and 21:9. The aspect ratio is important because it determines how images and text are displayed on the screen. For example, a 4:3 aspect ratio is suitable for older monitors and TVs, while a 16:9 aspect ratio is more common in modern widescreen displays.\n\n**High-definition**\n\nHigh-definition (HD) display resolution standards have become the norm in modern displays. HD resolutions offer a significant improvement over standard-definition (SD) resolutions, with more pixels on the screen resulting in sharper and more detailed images.\n\n### **640 × 360 (nHD)**\n\nThe nHD (Near High Definition) resolution is a lower-resolution HD standard that is used in some mobile devices and small displays. The nHD resolution has a pixel density of 114 pixels per inch (PPI), which is lower than other HD resolutions.\n\n### **960 × 540 (qHD)**\n\nThe qHD (Quarter High Definition) resolution is another lower-resolution HD standard that is used in some mobile devices and small displays. The qHD resolution has a pixel density of 220 PPI, which is higher than nHD but lower than other HD resolutions.\n\n### **1280 × 720 (HD)**\n\nThe HD resolution is the most common HD standard, used in most modern displays, including HDTVs, monitors, and mobile devices. The HD resolution has a pixel density of 326 PPI, which is suitable for most applications.\n\n### **1600 × 900 (HD+)**\n\nThe HD+ resolution is a higher-resolution HD standard that is used in some displays, particularly in mobile devices and small monitors. The HD+ resolution has a pixel density of 230 PPI, which is higher than HD.\n\n### **1920 × 1080 (FHD)**\n\nThe FHD (Full High Definition) resolution is a high-resolution HD standard that is used in many modern displays, including HDTVs, monitors, and mobile devices.
