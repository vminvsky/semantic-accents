It emerged as a distinct philosophical movement in the 3rd century AD, and its Influence can be seen in various aspects of Western philosophy, including Christianity, Gnosticism, and Western Renaissance thought.\n\n**Origins of the Term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was first coined by 19th-century scholars to distinguish the philosophical school from the original Platonic Academy in Athens. The term \"Neoplatonism\" was initially used to describe the philosophical teachings of Plotinus, a 3rd-century Greek philosopher who synthesized elements of Plato's philosophy with various other philosophical and spiritual traditions.\n\n**Origins and History of Classical Neoplatonism**\n\n### Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the context of Hellenistic philosophy, which emphasized the pursuit of knowledge and the development of a philosophical system that could explain the nature of reality. Hellenistic philosophers such as Aristotle and the Stoics had already laid the groundwork for the development of Neoplatonism, which built upon their ideas.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nAmmonius Saccas, a 2nd-century AD Greek philosopher, is often credited with laying the groundwork for Neoplatonism. He was a student of the Stoic philosopher Posidonius and developed a philosophical system that emphasized the importance of spiritual practices and the development of the human soul.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (205-270 AD) was a Greek philosopher from Egypt who is widely regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. He was a student of Ammonius Saccas and developed a philosophical system that synthesized elements of Plato's philosophy with various other philosophical and spiritual traditions. Plotinus' teachings emphasized the importance of spiritual practices, the development of the human soul, and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (234-305 AD) was a Greek philosopher and student of Plotinus. He was a key figure in the development of Neoplatonism and wrote several important works, including the \"Isagoge,\" a treatise on logic and the foundations of Neoplatonic philosophy.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (245-325 AD) was a Greek philosopher from Syria who developed a philosophical system that emphasized the importance of spiritual practices and the development of the human soul. He was a key figure in the development of Neoplatonism and wrote several important works, including the \"Chaldean Oracles,\" a treatise on the nature of the divine and the human condition.\n\n### Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonists established several philosophical academies, including the Academy in Athens, which became a major center of Neoplatonic learning. The academies provided a forum for the discussion and development of Neoplatonic ideas and attracted many students and scholars from across the ancient world.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician who taught at the Academy in Alexandria. She was a key figure in the development of Neoplatonism and was known for her teachings on the nature of the divine and the human condition.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (412-485 AD) was a Greek philosopher who was a key figure in the development of Neoplatonism. He was a student of the Academy in Athens and developed a philosophical system that emphasized the importance of spiritual practices and the development of the human soul.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nOne of the central ideas of Neoplatonism is the concept of the One, which is the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. The One is considered to be beyond human understanding and is the object of spiritual aspiration.\n\n### Emanations\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that the One emanates a series of levels of reality, including the Demiurge or nous, the world-soul, and the phenomenal world. Each level of reality is considered to be a reflection of the One and is characterized by a decreasing degree of unity and increasing degree of multiplicity.\n\n### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe Demiurge or nous is the second level of reality in the Neoplatonic system. It is the divine intellect that brings order and structure to the world. The Demiurge is considered to be a reflection of the One and is the source of all knowledge and wisdom.\n\n### World-soul\n\nThe world-soul is the third level of reality in the Neoplatonic system. It is the animating principle of the world and is responsible for the life and movement of all living things. The world-soul is considered to be a reflection of the Demiurge and is the source of all life and vitality.\n\n### Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world is the fourth level of reality in the Neoplatonic system. It is the world of experience and sensation, characterized by multiplicity and diversity. The phenomenal world is considered to be a reflection of the world-soul and is the source of all sensory experience.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that the universe is governed by a celestial hierarchy, with the One at the top and the phenomenal world at the bottom. Each level of reality is characterized by a decreasing degree of unity and increasing degree of multiplicity.\n\n### Evil\n\nNeoplatonism teaches that evil is a privation of being and a lack of unity. It is a consequence of the limitations and imperfections of the phenomenal world. Evil is not a positive entity, but rather a lack of the divine presence.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nOne of the central teachings of Neoplatonism is the idea of the return to the One. This involves the spiritual aspiration to transcend the limitations and imperfections of the phenomenal world and return to the unity and perfection of the One.\n\n**Influence**\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on early Christianity, particularly through the teachings of Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius. The concept of the divine as a unity beyond human understanding is a central theme in Neoplatonism and was adopted by early Christian theologians.\n\n### Augustine\n\nAugustine of Hippo (354-430 AD) was a Christian theologian who was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. He incorporated many Neoplatonic ideas into his teachings, particularly the concept of the divine as a unity beyond human understanding.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (185-254 AD) and Pseudo-Dionysius (5th century AD) were Christian theologians who were heavily influenced by Neoplatonism.

From its origins in traditional school dramas and nativity scenes to its development as a distinct art form, Ukrainian opera has been shaped by the country's unique cultural and historical context.\n\n**Origins**\n\n#### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nShkilʹna dramy, or school dramas, were a key part of Ukraine's literary and theatrical heritage. These performances, often held in schools and churches, were a way for young people to learn about history, morality, and national identity. Shkilʹna dramy typically featured short, simple plays that were performed to music, with a focus on storytelling and character development.\n\n#### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nVertepy, or nativity scenes, were another important part of Ukraine's theatrical tradition. These elaborate tableaux depicted the Christmas story, with intricate costumes and sets. Vertepy often featured music and singing, and were an important part of Ukraine's holiday celebrations.\n\n#### Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a type of variety entertainment that originated in Europe, was popular in Ukraine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Vaudeville shows typically featured a mix of singing, dancing, comedy, and drama, and often included Ukrainian folk music and dance. Vaudeville was an important influence on the development of Ukrainian opera, as it helped to establish the country's rich cultural heritage and paved the way for the creation of more complex and sophisticated theatrical works.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a type of light opera that originated in Europe, was popular in Ukraine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Operetta shows typically featured a mix of music, singing, and comedy, and often included Ukrainian folk music and dance. Operetta was an important part of Ukraine's cultural scene, and helped to establish the country's reputation as a center of musical and theatrical excellence.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the popularity of shkilʹna dramy, vertepy, vaudeville, and operetta, the development of Ukrainian-language opera was hindered by a number of obstacles. These included:\n\n* The lack of a native Ukrainian literary and cultural tradition\n* The dominance of Russian culture and language in Ukraine\n* The country's tumultuous history, which made it difficult to establish a stable and supportive cultural infrastructure\n* The limited availability of resources and funding for cultural projects\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\n#### Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko, a Ukrainian composer and pianist, is widely regarded as the father of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko was born in 1842 in Ukraine, and began his musical studies at the age of seven. He went on to study at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he was influenced by the works of Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Modest Mussorgsky.\n\nLysenko's most famous work, \"Taras Bulba,\" was composed in 1891 and premiered at the St. Petersburg Imperial Opera. The opera was a huge success, and helped to establish Lysenko as a major figure in Ukrainian cultural life.\n\n#### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors included a number of other talented Ukrainian composers and artists. These included:\n\n* Mykola Leontovych, a composer and conductor who was known for his beautiful and expressive music\n* Kyrylo Stetsenko, a composer and conductor who was known for his innovative and experimental style\n* Oleksandr Koshetz, a composer and conductor who was known for his work in the field of Ukrainian folk music\n\nThese artists, along with Lysenko, helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a major cultural force in the country, and paved the way for the creation of future generations of Ukrainian composers and artists.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\n#### 1910s\n\nThe 1910s saw a period of resurgence in Ukrainian opera, with a number of new composers and artists emerging on the scene. These included:\n\n* Levko Revutsky, a composer and conductor who was known for his beautiful and expressive music\n* Borys Lyatochenko, a composer and conductor who was known for his innovative and experimental style\n\nThese artists, along with Lysenko and his contemporaries, helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a major cultural force in the country, and paved the way for the creation of future generations of Ukrainian composers and artists.\n\n#### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a period of significant change and upheaval in Ukraine, with the country facing a number of challenges and threats. Despite these challenges, Ukrainian opera continued to thrive, with a number of new composers and artists emerging on the scene. These included:\n\n* Mykola Skoryk, a composer and conductor who was known for his beautiful and expressive music\n* Volodymyr Danylenko, a composer and conductor who was known for his innovative and experimental style\n\nThese artists, along with their predecessors, helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a major cultural force in the country, and paved the way for the creation of future generations of Ukrainian composers and artists.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nHistorical opera was a key part of Ukrainian opera in the 1920s and 1930s. This type of opera typically featured stories and characters from Ukrainian history, and was often used as a way to promote national pride and identity.\n\nHistorical opera was popularized by a number of Ukrainian composers and artists, including:\n\n* Mykola Skoryk, who composed a number of historical operas, including \"The Cossacks\" and \"The Zaporozhian Cossacks\"\n* Volodymyr Danylenko, who composed a number of historical operas, including \"The Battle of the Irpin River\" and \"The Capture of the Khan's Camp\"\n\nThese operas, along with others like them, helped to promote Ukrainian history and culture, and paved the way for the creation of future generations of Ukrainian composers and artists.\n\n**Stalinism (1932–1956)**\n\nThe Stalinist period in Ukraine was marked by significant repression and censorship, with the government seeking to suppress any forms of cultural or artistic expression that were deemed to be counter-revolutionary.\n\nUkrainian opera was no exception, with many composers and artists being forced to conform to the government's strict ideological and artistic guidelines. This period saw the emergence of a number of \"official\" Ukrainian composers and artists, who were tasked with producing works that were deemed to be ideologically correct.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ukrainian opera continued to thrive, with a number of talented composers and artists emerging on the scene. These included:\n\n* Mykola Amosov, a composer and conductor who was known for his beautiful and expressive music\n* Oleksandr Fesyun, a composer and conductor who was known for his innovative and experimental style\n\nThese artists, along with their predecessors, helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a major cultural force in the country, and paved the way for the creation of future generations of Ukrainian composers and artists.\n\n**World War II**\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was occupied by Nazi Germany, and the country suffered significant losses and destruction. Despite these challenges, Ukrainian opera continued to thrive, with a number of composers and artists emerging on the scene.\n\nThese included:\n\n* Mykola Skoryk, who composed a number of operas, including \"The Cossacks\" and \"The Zaporozhian Cossacks\"\n* Volodymyr Danylenko, who composed a number of operas, including \"The Battle of the Irpin River\" and \"The Capture of the Khan's Camp\"\n\nThese artists, along with others like them, helped to promote Ukrainian culture and national identity, and paved the way for the creation of future generations of Ukrainian composers and artists.\n\n**1945–1953**\n\nThe post-war period in Ukraine saw a number of significant changes and challenges, including the country's transition from a Soviet republic to an independent state.\n\nDespite these challenges, Ukrainian opera continued to thrive, with a number of talented composers and artists emerging on the scene.

The files have sparked controversy and debate, shedding light on Twitter's content moderation policies, relationships with governments, and handling of sensitive topics.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nTwitter, a microblogging platform, has been at the forefront of online discourse since its inception in 2006. With over 440 million monthly active users, Twitter has become a primary source of information and a platform for public discussion. However, the company's efforts to maintain a balanced and safe online environment have been scrutinized, leading to the release of the Twitter Files.\n\nTopics\n------\n\n### No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nOne of the earliest and most significant Twitter Files revelations concerns the company's decision to flag and restrict access to a New York Post article about Hunter Biden's laptop in October 2020. Twitter's initial response was to apply a \"label\" to the article, citing concerns about the \"sensationalism\" and \"harm\" it might cause. The move was widely criticized, with many accusing Twitter of election interference and censorship. The files revealed that Twitter's moderation team had been influenced by external factors, including the FBI, which had warned the company about potential Russian disinformation.\n\n### No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nThe Twitter Files also exposed the company's use of visibility filtering, a practice where certain users' content is artificially suppressed or amplified. This technique has been employed to counter misinformation and promote verified content. However, critics argue that it can be used to silence opposing viewpoints and stifle free speech. The files showed that Twitter's moderation team had been experimenting with visibility filtering, often without clear guidelines or transparency.\n\n### Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nIn the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, Twitter faced intense scrutiny for its handling of Donald Trump's account. The files revealed that Twitter's moderation team had been debating whether to suspend Trump's account, ultimately deciding to do so after the President's tweets were deemed to be \"inciting violence.\" The decision sparked controversy, with some arguing that it was an overreach of Twitter's authority and others praising the company's commitment to public safety.\n\n### Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nThe Twitter Files also shed light on the company's interactions with the FBI, particularly regarding content moderation and national security. The files revealed that Twitter's Trust and Safety team had been in regular communication with the FBI, often receiving guidance on how to handle sensitive topics. Critics argue that this level of cooperation can compromise Twitter's neutrality and independence.\n\n### Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nThe Twitter Files have also highlighted the company's close relationship with the US government. The files show that Twitter has been working closely with government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, on issues related to national security and public safety. While this collaboration may be necessary to address certain threats, critics argue that it can also be used to silence opposing viewpoints and stifle free speech.\n\n### No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter faced numerous challenges in moderating content related to the outbreak. The files revealed that the company had been working with public health experts to develop guidelines for handling COVID-19-related content, often in collaboration with government agencies. While this collaboration was necessary to address the pandemic, critics argue that it can also be used to restrict free speech and stifle dissenting opinions.\n\n### No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe Twitter Files also exposed the company's involvement with the Hamilton 68 dashboard, a tool created by the Alliance for Securing Democracy to track Russian disinformation on Twitter. The files revealed that Twitter had been working closely with the ASD to develop the dashboard, often providing sensitive information about users and their activity. Critics argue that this level of cooperation can compromise Twitter's neutrality and independence.\n\n### No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nThe Twitter Files have also shed light on the company's handling of insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The files revealed that Twitter's moderation team had been debating whether to restrict access to certain tweets, often citing concerns about \"hate speech\" and \"harassment.\" While this move may be necessary to address certain threats, critics argue that it can also be used to silence opposing viewpoints and stifle free speech.\n\n### No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe Twitter Files also exposed the company's involvement with the Global Engagement Center (GEC), a US government agency tasked with countering foreign propaganda and disinformation. The files revealed that Twitter had been working closely with the GEC, often providing sensitive information about users and their activity. Critics argue that this level of cooperation can compromise Twitter's neutrality and independence.\n\n### No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe Twitter Files have also shed light on the company's involvement with the Virality Project, a collaborative effort between Twitter and the Knight Foundation to track and study the spread of misinformation on social media. The files revealed that Twitter had been working closely with the Virality Project, often providing sensitive information about users and their activity. Critics argue that this level of cooperation can compromise Twitter's neutrality and independence.\n\nReactions\n----------\n\n### Politicians\n\nThe Twitter Files have sparked widespread controversy and debate, with politicians on both sides of the aisle weighing in on the company's handling of sensitive topics. Some politicians have praised Twitter's efforts to maintain a safe and balanced online environment, while others have criticized the company's overreach and lack of transparency.\n\n### FBI\n\nThe FBI has also been involved in the controversy surrounding the Twitter Files, with some critics arguing that the agency has been too closely tied to the company's content moderation policies. The files revealed that the FBI had been working closely with Twitter's Trust and Safety team, often providing guidance on how to handle sensitive topics.\n\n### Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have also weighed in on the Twitter Files controversy, with some arguing that the company's content moderation policies may be in conflict with free speech and due process. Others have argued that Twitter has a responsibility to maintain a safe and balanced online environment, even if that means limiting certain types of content.\n\n### Privacy and security\n\nThe Twitter Files have raised concerns about the company's handling of user data and its interactions with government agencies. Critics argue that Twitter's lack of transparency and accountability can compromise users' privacy and security, particularly in the context of national security and law enforcement.\n\n### Former Twitter CEO\n\nThe Twitter Files have also sparked controversy among former Twitter employees, including the company's former CEO. Some have argued that the company's content moderation policies were overly broad and restrictive, while others have praised the company's efforts to maintain a safe and balanced online environment.\n\n### Journalists\n\nJournalists have also been involved in the controversy surrounding the Twitter Files, with some arguing that the company's lack of transparency and accountability can compromise their ability to report on sensitive topics. Others have praised Twitter's efforts to maintain a safe and balanced online environment, even if that means limiting certain types of content.\n\n### Wikipedia article\n\nThe Twitter Files controversy has also led to changes in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, with some arguing that the company's content moderation policies may be in conflict with free speech and due process. Others have argued that Twitter has a responsibility to maintain a safe and balanced online environment, even if that means limiting certain types of content.\n\nAftermath\n---------\n\nThe Twitter Files controversy has sparked widespread debate and concern about the company's content moderation policies and its interactions with government agencies. While some argue that the company has a responsibility to maintain a safe and balanced online environment, others argue that its policies may be overly broad and restrictive, compromising free speech and due process.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Twitter_Files\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread damage, flooding, and loss of life, prompting a massive humanitarian response. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history, impact, and aftermath of Storm Daniel.\n\n# Meteorological History\nStorm Daniel formed over the Mediterranean Sea on June 7, 2023. The storm was a hybrid low-pressure system, combining characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. It intensified rapidly, fueled by warm ocean waters and a favorable atmospheric environment. As the storm moved northwards, it brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in the region.\n\n## Formation and Strengthening\nThe storm formed as a low-pressure system over the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 500 km northwest of Libya. Initially, it was a relatively weak system, but it began to intensify as it moved northwards. The storm's center of circulation became more defined, and its winds began to pick up speed. By June 9, the storm had strengthened into a tropical-like cyclone, with sustained winds of 120 km/h.\n\n## Landfall and Intensification\nOn June 10, Storm Daniel made landfall in northeastern Libya, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds. The storm intensified further as it moved over the coastal regions, fueled by the warm ocean waters. By June 11, the storm had reached its peak intensity, with sustained winds of 150 km/h and gusts of up to 200 km/h.\n\n# Impact\nStorm Daniel caused widespread damage and disruption in several countries in the region. The storm's impact was particularly severe in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Libya.\n\n## Greece\nIn Greece, Storm Daniel caused significant damage and disruption. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing widespread power outages and damaging buildings and infrastructure.

In this system, the top four candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election. The top-four primary is designed to increase voter choice and reduce the spoiler effect, where a candidate wins the election by default due to a divided opposition.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Top-four\n\nThe top-four primary has been implemented in several states, including Alaska and Missouri. In both states, the top four candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election.\n\nAlaska\nThe top-four primary was first implemented in Alaska in 2020. The system was designed to increase voter choice and reduce the spoiler effect. In the first election under the new system, several candidates from different parties advanced to the general election, increasing voter choice and increasing turnout.\n\nMissouri\nMissouri implemented the top-four primary in 2020, although it was later repealed in 2022. The system was designed to increase voter choice and reduce the spoiler effect. However, the system was repealed due to concerns about vote splitting and voter deception.\n\n### Top-five\n\nSome states, such as Nevada, have implemented a top-five primary system. In this system, the top five candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election.\n\nNevada\nNevada implemented the top-five primary in 2020. The system was designed to increase voter choice and reduce the spoiler effect. However, the system has been criticized for being confusing and for allowing too many candidates to advance to the general election.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe top-four primary has several benefits, including:\n\n* Increased voter choice: The top-four primary allows voters to choose from a wider range of candidates, increasing their ability to select a candidate that best represents their views.\n* Reduced spoiler effect: The top-four primary reduces the spoiler effect, where a candidate wins the election by default due to a divided opposition.\n* Increased turnout: The top-four primary has been shown to increase voter turnout, as voters are more likely to participate in an election with more choices.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThe top-four primary also has several drawbacks, including:\n\n### Vote splitting\n\nVote splitting occurs when a candidate's presence in the election causes their supporters to split their votes, allowing another candidate to win. The top-four primary can exacerbate vote splitting, as voters may feel forced to choose between two or more candidates who are similar in their views.\n\n### Primary\n\nIn a primary election, vote splitting can occur when voters choose a candidate who is not the most electable. This can lead to a candidate who is not the most popular or well-funded winning the election.\n\n### General\n\nIn a general election, vote splitting can occur when voters choose a candidate who is not the most electable. This can lead to a candidate who is not the most popular or well-funded winning the election.\n\n## Voter deception\n\nThe top-four primary can also lead to voter deception, where voters are misled about the candidates and their views. This can occur when candidates use confusing or misleading language to describe their policies or when voters are not fully informed about the candidates.\n\n## Variations\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary, including:\n\n### Final Five Voting\n\nFinal Five Voting is a system used in some states where the top five candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary but allows for more candidates to advance to the general election.\n\n### Primary\n\nSome states use a modified top-four primary system, where the top four candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election. However, this system allows voters to choose a candidate from a specific party.\n\n### Post-primary\n\nSome states use a post-primary system, where the top four candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election. However, this system allows voters to choose a candidate from a specific party.\n\n### General\n\nSome states use a general election system, where all candidates with a certain percentage of votes, regardless of party, advance to the general election. However, this system allows voters to choose a candidate from a specific party.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe top-four primary is a system that has been implemented in several states, including Alaska and Missouri. The system allows the top four candidates with the most votes, regardless of party, to advance to the general election. While the top-four primary has several benefits, including increased voter choice and reduced spoiler effect, it also has several drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception.\n\n## See also\n\n* Primary election\n* General election\n* Election reform\n* Voter choice\n* Spoiler effect\n\n## External links\n\n* Top Four Primary System in Alaska\n* Top Four Primary System in Missouri\n* Top Five Primary System in Nevada", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The invasion has resulted in a significant escalation of violence, displacement of people, and humanitarian crisis. This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the key events and developments during the invasion.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has its roots in the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the ongoing support of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The situation escalated in February 2022, when Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, a move widely seen as a pretext for a full-scale invasion.\n\n**#Prelude**\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, tensions between Russia and Ukraine continued to escalate. In October 2021, Russia began to amass troops along the border with Ukraine, with some estimates suggesting that up to 100,000 soldiers had been deployed. Ukraine's military also began to mobilize, with President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing a partial mobilization in January 2022.\n\nOn 16 February 2022, Russia and Ukraine signed a deal aimed at reducing tensions, but it ultimately failed to prevent the invasion. On 21 February, Russia's parliament voted to authorize the use of military force in Ukraine, and on 23 February, Putin announced that he would be recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.\n\n**#Initial invasion**\n\nOn 24 February 2022, at 05:00 AM local time, Russian forces launched a massive artillery and missile strike against Ukrainian military targets, followed by a ground invasion by Russian troops. The initial invasion focused on several key objectives, including the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol.\n\nRussian forces made rapid gains in the first few days of the invasion, capturing key cities and infrastructure, including the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. However, Ukrainian forces were able to resist the invasion in some areas, including the city of Kyiv, where they launched a series of counterattacks.\n\n**#Southeastern front**\n\nAs the invasion progressed, Russian forces began to focus on the southeastern front, where they sought to capture the city of Mariupol and the surrounding region. The city of Mariupol was heavily bombarded, with Russian forces using artillery and airstrikes to try to break through Ukrainian defenses.\n\nIn March 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a series of counterattacks against Russian positions in the southeastern front, including the city of Volnovakha. The counterattacks were successful in pushing Russian forces back, but ultimately failed to retake the city of Mariupol.\n\n**#2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives**\n\nIn June 2022, Ukraine launched a series of counteroffensives against Russian forces, including a major operation in the Kharkiv region. The counteroffensives were successful in pushing Russian forces back, and Ukraine was able to retake several key cities and territories.\n\nThe counteroffensives were seen as a major turning point in the war, with Ukraine gaining momentum and pushing Russian forces back. However, the war continued to escalate, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n**#Second stalemate**\n\nAs the summer of 2022 progressed, the war entered a new phase of stalemate, with both sides engaged in a series of small-scale battles and skirmishes. The stalemate was marked by a significant increase in use of artillery and other forms of indirect fire, as both sides sought to wear down the other's forces.\n\nThe stalemate continued into the fall of 2022, with both sides suffering significant losses. However, Ukraine was able to maintain a strong position, and was able to continue to push Russian forces back.\n\n**#2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive**\n\nIn January 2023, Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive against Russian forces, aimed at retaking the city of Bakhmut. The counteroffensive was successful in pushing Russian forces back, and Ukraine was able to retake several key cities and territories.\n\nThe counteroffensive was seen as a major turning point in the war, with Ukraine gaining momentum and pushing Russian forces back. However, the war continued to escalate, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n**#Second winter campaign**\n\nAs the winter of 2023 progressed, the war entered a new phase of intense fighting, with both sides engaging in a series of major battles and skirmishes. The fighting was marked by a significant increase in use of artillery and other forms of indirect fire, as both sides sought to wear down the other's forces.\n\nThe fighting continued into the spring of 2023, with both sides suffering significant losses. However, Ukraine was able to maintain a strong position, and was able to continue to push Russian forces back.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* Russia–Ukraine relations\n* Annexation of Crimea by Russia\n* Eastern Ukraine conflict\n* Ukrainian-Russian War\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n**#References**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as this article does not contain any citations or references.)\n\n**#External links**\n\n* BBC News: Ukraine conflict\n* Al Jazeera: Ukraine crisis\n* The New York Times: Ukraine Invasion\n* The Guardian: Ukraine war\n* CNN: Ukraine conflict", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Prelude\n#Initial invasion\n#Southeastern front\n#2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n#Second stalemate\n#2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Second winter campaign\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The committee was formed in response to the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in the deaths of five people and injured many more.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea to establish a committee to investigate the January 6 attack was first proposed in January 2021 by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called for a bipartisan commission to investigate the events surrounding the attack. However, Senate Republicans blocked the creation of a bipartisan commission, leading Pelosi to announce the formation of a select committee in May 2021.\n\nThe committee was composed of seven Democrats and two Republicans, with Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) serving as its chairman. The committee's initial focus was on gathering information and conducting interviews with witnesses, including former White House officials and law enforcement personnel.\n\n**Members**\n\nThe members of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack were:\n\n* **Chairman:** Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS)\n* **Ranking Member:** Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY)\n* **Democrats:**\n\t+ Rep. Adam Schiff (CA-28)\n\t+ Rep. Zoe Lofgren (CA-19)\n\t+ Rep. Jamie Raskin (MD-8)\n\t+ Rep. Elaine Luria (VA-2)\n\t+ Rep. Stephanie Murphy (FL-7)\n\t+ Rep. Pete Aguilar (CA-31)\n* **Republicans:**\n\t+ Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY)\n\t+ Rep. Adam Kinzinger (IL-16)\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe committee's investigation focused on several key areas, including the role of former President Donald Trump and his administration in the events leading up to the attack, as well as the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack itself.\n\n### Simultaneous investigations by the Justice Department\n\nIn addition to the committee's investigation, the Justice Department also launched a separate investigation into the January 6 attack, led by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. The Justice Department investigation focused on identifying and prosecuting individuals involved in the attack, including rioters and those who may have planned or incited the violence.\n\n### Information received from Mark Meadows\n\nIn October 2021, the committee received testimony from Mark Meadows, the former White House Chief of Staff, who provided information about the events leading up to the attack. Meadows' testimony included details about the Trump administration's response to the attack, as well as Meadows' own interactions with Trump and other officials on January 6.\n\n### Obstacles\n\nThe committee faced several obstacles during its investigation, including:\n\n* **Release of documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA):** The committee requested documents from NARA related to the Trump administration's response to the attack, but NARA initially refused to release the documents, citing concerns about the president's privilege claims.\n* **Republicans not testifying:** Several Republican members of the committee refused to testify, citing concerns about the legitimacy of the investigation.\n* **Secret Service, DHS and Pentagon text messages deleted:** The Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Pentagon reported that text messages related to the events of January 6 had been deleted, which the committee argued was a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.\n* **Trump funding legal defense of Republican witnesses:** Trump's Save America PAC funded the legal defense of Republican witnesses who were being investigated by the committee.\n* **Republican National Committee (RNC) claiming committee is illegitimate:** The RNC claimed that the committee was illegitimate and that its actions were unconstitutional.\n\n**Public findings**\n\nThe committee held several public hearings in 2021 and 2022, during which it presented evidence and testimony related to the January 6 attack. The public hearings were widely watched and sparked significant public debate about the events surrounding the attack.\n\n### 2021 public hearings\n\nThe committee held its first public hearing in July 2021, during which it presented testimony from law enforcement personnel and witnesses who had been in the Capitol on January 6. The hearing focused on the events leading up to the attack and the actions of law enforcement during the attack.\n\n### 2022 public hearings\n\nThe committee held several public hearings in 2022, during which it presented evidence and testimony related to the role of former President Trump and his administration in the events leading up to the attack. The hearings focused on the Trump administration's response to the attack, as well as the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack.\n\n### Criminal referrals\n\nIn December 2022, the committee made several criminal referrals to the Justice Department, including to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. The referrals included charges related to conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding, and making false statements to Congress.\n\n### Impact on other investigations\n\nThe committee's investigation had a significant impact on other investigations related to the January 6 attack, including the Justice Department's investigation and the ongoing investigations by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.\n\n### Witness testimony transcripts\n\nThe committee released the transcripts of witness testimony in 2022, which provided further insight into the events surrounding the January 6 attack.\n\n**Final report**\n\nThe committee released its final report in January 2023, which provided a comprehensive overview of the events surrounding the January 6 attack. The report included findings and recommendations related to the attack, as well as a detailed account of the committee's investigation.\n\n### Before publication\n\nBefore the publication of the final report, the committee held a final public hearing in December 2022, during which it presented evidence and testimony related to the attack. The hearing focused on the Trump administration's response to the attack and the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe final report provided a summary of the committee's findings and recommendations related to the January 6 attack. The report concluded that the attack was a result of a coordinated effort by Trump and his allies, and that the Trump administration's response to the attack was inadequate.\n\n### Full report\n\nThe full report provided a detailed account of the committee's investigation, including the events leading up to the attack, the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack, and the Trump administration's response to the attack. The report included evidence and testimony from witnesses, as well as documentation of the committee's findings and recommendations.\n\n**Timeline of proceedings**\n\nThe committee's investigation and public hearings spanned several years, with the following key events:\n\n### 2021\n\n* **July 2021:** The committee held its first public hearing, which focused on the events leading up to the attack and the actions of law enforcement during the attack.\n* **August 2021:** The committee received testimony from Mark Meadows, the former White House Chief of Staff.\n* **September 2021:** The committee held a hearing on the Trump administration's response to the attack.\n* **October 2021:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been in the Capitol on January 6.\n* **November 2021:** The committee held a hearing on the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack.\n* **December 2021:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been involved in the planning and execution of the attack.\n\n### 2022\n\n* **January 2022:** The committee held a hearing on the Trump administration's response to the attack.\n* **February 2022:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been in the Capitol on January 6.\n* **March 2022:** The committee held a hearing on the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack.\n* **April 2022:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been involved in the planning and execution of the attack.\n* **May 2022:** The committee held a hearing on the Trump administration's response to the attack.\n* **June 2022:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been in the Capitol on January 6.\n* **July 2022:** The committee held a hearing on the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack.\n* **August 2022:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been involved in the planning and execution of the attack.\n* **September 2022:** The committee held a hearing on the Trump administration's response to the attack.\n* **October 2022:** The committee received testimony from witnesses who had been in the Capitol on January 6.\n* **November 2022:** The committee held a hearing on the actions of law enforcement and security personnel during the attack.\n* **December 2022:** The committee held its final public hearing and made several criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\n**Subpoenas**\n\nThe committee issued several subpoenas to witnesses and organizations related to the January 6 attack, including:\n\n* **Mark Meadows:** The committee subpoenaed Meadows, the former White House Chief of Staff, to testify about his involvement in the events leading up to the attack.\n* **Donald Trump:** The committee subpoenaed Trump to testify about his involvement in the events leading up to the attack.\n* **Rudy Giuliani:** The committee subpoenaed Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney, to testify about his involvement in the events leading up to the attack.\n* **Patriot Front:** The committee subpoenaed the Patriot Front, a white nationalist group, to testify about its involvement in the attack.\n* **Oath Keepers:** The committee subpoenaed the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, to testify about its involvement in the attack.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Prior to committee formation\n\nBefore the committee was formed, there was significant debate and controversy surrounding the January 6 attack.

Born on December 25, 1745, in Guadeloupe, he rose to prominence in the 18th century as a virtuosic musician and a champion of the Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. His life was marked by both extraordinary achievements and tragic circumstances.\n\n**Early life**\n\nThe Chevalier de Saint-Georges was born Jean-Baptiste de Villemain, the son of a French planter, Georges de Balfourier, and his enslaved African mistress, Nanon. His father later acknowledged him as his son and provided for his education in France. Saint-Georges attended the École Militaire in Paris, where he excelled in his studies and developed his musical talents.\n\n**Musical life and career**\n\nSaint-Georges began his musical career as a violinist in the French Army, where he performed at various military functions and events. He later became a member of the Paris Opera Orchestra, where he worked alongside prominent composers and musicians of the time. Saint-Georges was particularly known for his virtuosic violin playing and his ability to perform with great expression and passion.\n\n**Operas**\n\nSaint-Georges composed several operas, including \"Ernestine\" and \"L'Amant Anonyme\" (The Anonymous Lover). His operas were known for their beautiful music, engaging plots, and strong characters. Saint-Georges' operas were performed at the Paris Opera, where they received critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\n**Social life in Paris**\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, known for his charm, wit, and musical talents. He was a frequent guest at salons and aristocratic gatherings, where he would perform and socialize with the city's elite. Saint-Georges was also a member of the prestigious Académie des Beaux-Arts, where he was recognized for his contributions to the arts.\n\n### St. Georges assaulted\n\nIn 1783, Saint-Georges was assaulted by a group of men who were angry about his association with a woman of lower social status. The incident was widely reported in the Parisian press, and it highlighted the prejudices and social tensions of the time. Saint-Georges was shaken by the attack, but he continued to pursue his musical career with determination and passion.\n\n**Two trips to London**\n\nIn 1783, Saint-Georges traveled to London, where he performed as a violinist and composer. He was received warmly by the British public, who were impressed by his musical talents and his charming personality. Saint-Georges returned to London in 1785, where he continued to perform and compose music.\n\n### Second trip\n\nDuring his second trip to London, Saint-Georges met with prominent musicians and composers, including Johann Christian Bach and Haydn. He was also introduced to the British aristocracy, who were fascinated by his exotic background and his musical talents.\n\n**Lille**\n\nIn 1787, Saint-Georges traveled to Lille, where he was appointed as the director of the city's opera house. He worked tirelessly to promote the arts and to establish Lille as a center for musical excellence.\n\n**Military career**\n\nSaint-Georges served in the French Army during the Revolution, where he rose to the rank of captain. He was known for his bravery and his leadership abilities, and he was respected by his fellow soldiers.\n\n**Possible Saint-Domingue visit**\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that Saint-Georges may have visited Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) during his lifetime. However, this is still a matter of debate among historians, and more research is needed to confirm this theory.\n\n**Death**\n\nThe Chevalier de Saint-Georges died on June 10, 1799, in Paris. His death was a tragic loss for the musical world, and it was widely mourned by his friends and colleagues. Saint-Georges was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, where many other notable figures are interred.\n\n**Home**\n\nSaint-Georges' home in Paris was a grand mansion located on the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin.

The season began on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n**The race for first place**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was highly competitive, with several teams vying for the title throughout the campaign. Manchester City, last season's runners-up, started the season strongly, winning their first six matches.

Chelsea, led by Thomas Tuchel, also made a strong start, winning their first four matches, but ultimately finished third.\n\n**Newcastle takeover**\n\nThe 2021–22 season saw a significant development in the world of English football, as the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) acquired a majority stake in Newcastle United.

The Premier League introduced various measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including the use of virtual substitution and increased testing protocols.\n\n**Abramovich sanctions**\n\nIn February 2022, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions prohibited Abramovich from conducting any business in the UK, including the sale of Chelsea. The Premier League was left to navigate the impact of the sanctions on the club's ownership and operations.\n\n**Final day climax**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season concluded with a thrilling final day, as several teams battled for the title and relegation. Manchester City won the title with a 3-2 victory over Aston Villa, despite Liverpool's 3-1 win over Southampton. The result confirmed Manchester City's second title in three seasons.\n\n### Title\n\nManchester City won their fourth Premier League title, with a total of 93 points from 38 matches.

The film is the direct sequel to Halloween Kills and the thirteenth installment in the Halloween franchise. It is also the final film in the franchise's current continuity.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Halloween franchise has been a staple of horror cinema for over four decades, with a rich history of sequels, remakes, and reboots. The original Halloween, released in 1978, was a groundbreaking film that introduced the world to Michael Myers, a masked killer who stalks and murders his victims on Halloween night. Since then, the franchise has undergone numerous creative reimaginings, with each iteration offering a unique take on the Michael Myers character and the Halloween universe.\n\nThe 2018 film Halloween, directed by David Gordon Green, marked a new beginning for the franchise, offering a direct sequel to the original film while ignoring all previous sequels. The film's success led to a sequel, Halloween Kills, which continued the story of Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. The third installment in the new trilogy, Halloween Ends, concludes the story of the iconic characters and brings the franchise's current continuity to a close.\n\n**Plot**\n\nHalloween Ends takes place four years after the events of Halloween Kills. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is still recovering from her injuries and is struggling to come to terms with the trauma she has experienced. Meanwhile, Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney) has escaped from the Smith's Grove Sanitarium and is once again on the loose.\n\nAs the film begins, Laurie is living in a secluded rural area, where she is trying to rebuild her life. However, she soon discovers that Michael has returned to Haddonfield, Illinois, and is targeting her once again. Laurie teams up with her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak), and her friend, Chad (Rohan Campbell), to try and stop Michael.\n\nAs the body count rises, Laurie and her friends realize that Michael's actions are not just driven by a desire to kill, but also by a deeper psychological complexity. They discover that Michael's crimes are linked to a traumatic event in his childhood, which has shaped his behavior and motivations.\n\nAs the film reaches its climax, Laurie and Michael engage in a final confrontation. Laurie, who has been preparing for this moment, uses her knowledge of Michael's tactics and her own experience to try and defeat him. The film ends with Laurie emerging victorious, but not without scars. Michael, on the other hand, meets a tragic end, finally bringing an end to the horrors he has caused.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode\n* James Jude Courtney as Michael Myers\n* Andi Matichak as Allyson Nelson\n* Rohan Campbell as Chad\n* Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace\n* Will Patton as Frank Hawkins\n* Robert Longstreet as Lonnie Elam\n* Michael McDonald as Gary\n* Dylan Arnold as Cameron\n* Nicholas Gonzalez as Detective David Gordon\n* Kyle Gallner as Aaron\n* Melissa Barrera as Samantha\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Halloween Ends began shortly after the release of Halloween Kills.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, Rushdie's work often explores the complexities of identity, culture, and politics, particularly in the context of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nRushdie was born to Anis Ahmed Rushdie and Negin Bhatt Rushdie, a Muslim family of modest means. His father was a businessman, and his mother was a schoolteacher. Rushdie attended the Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay and later studied history at King's College, Cambridge. During his time at Cambridge, he became fascinated with the works of William Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot, and other modernist writers.\n\nRushdie's experience as a Muslim in a predominantly Hindu country would later play a significant role in shaping his writing. His family's Muslim heritage and his own cultural identity would become a recurring theme in his work.\n\n**Career**\n\nRushdie's career spans multiple genres, including copywriting, literary fiction, nonfiction, and screenwriting.\n\n**Copywriter**\n\nBefore turning to full-time writing, Rushdie worked as a copywriter in advertising agencies in Bombay and London. His experience in advertising helped him develop his skills in crafting compelling narratives and understanding the power of language.\n\n**Literary works**\n\nRushdie's literary career can be divided into several phases, each marked by significant works and changes in his writing style.\n\n### **Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975-1987**\n\nRushdie's first novel, _Grimus_ (1975), was met with critical acclaim and established him as a talented young writer. His subsequent works, including _Midnight's Children_ (1981) and _Shame_ (1983), further solidified his reputation as a masterful storyteller. _Midnight's Children_ won the Booker Prize in 1981, cementing Rushdie's status as a major literary figure.\n\n### **The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988-1990**\n\nThe publication of _The Satanic Verses_ (1988) sparked widespread controversy and debate. The novel's portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad and Islamic themes led to a fatwa (death sentence) being issued against Rushdie by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Rushdie's subsequent novel, _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_ (1990), was a children's book that explored themes of storytelling and identity.\n\n### **Further works, 1990s-2000s**\n\nRushdie continued to write extensively throughout the 1990s and 2000s, producing novels such as _The Moor's Last Sigh_ (1995), _The Ground Beneath Her Feet_ (1999), and _Fury_ (2001). His nonfiction work, _Step Across This Line_ (2002), collected his essays and reflections on politics, literature, and culture.\n\n### **Later works, novels, and essays, 2015-2024**\n\nRushdie's more recent works include _Luka and the Fire of Life_ (2010), a children's book that revisits the world of _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_; _Joseph Anton: A Memoir_ (2012), a memoir about his experiences under the fatwa; and _Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights_ (2015), a novel that explores themes of love, history, and fiction.\n\n**Critical reception**\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its innovative style, intellectual curiosity, and exploration of complex themes. Critics have praised his ability to blend historical and cultural references with modernist and postmodernist techniques. However, his work has also been criticized for its perceived lack of emotional depth and its tendency to prioritize style over substance.\n\n**Academic and other activities**\n\nRushdie has taught at several institutions, including the University of East Anglia and the University of California, Berkeley. He has also served as a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. In addition to his writing and teaching, Rushdie has been involved in various cultural and intellectual projects, including the establishment of the PEN American Center's Freedom to Write program.\n\n**Film and television**\n\nRushdie's work has been adapted into several films and television series, including _Midnight's Children_ (2012), _The Satanic Verses_ (1991), and _Joseph Anton_ (2020). His novel _Midnight's Children_ was adapted into a BBC television series in 1982.\n\n**The Satanic Verses and the fatwā**\n\nThe publication of _The Satanic Verses_ sparked a global controversy and led to a fatwa being issued against Rushdie by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. The fatwa called for Rushdie's death and led to a significant increase in security measures for the author.\n\n### **Failed assassination attempt (1989)**\n\nOn February 14, 1989, Rushdie was stabbed by a woman wielding a knife in the town of Brindisi, Italy. The attacker, a 30-year-old woman, was reportedly acting on a mistaken assumption that Rushdie was in the audience. Rushdie suffered injuries to his neck and chest but survived the attack.\n\n### **Hezbollah's comments (2006)**\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, called for Rushdie's execution, stating that the author's work was a \"crime against Islam.\"\n\n**International Guerillas (1990)**\n\nIn 1990, a group of Iranian-backed militants attempted to assassinate Rushdie in London. The group, known as the International Guerillas, was led by a man named Dieter Graumann.\n\n**Al-Qaeda hit list (2010)**\n\nIn 2010, Al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, included Rushdie on a list of targets for assassination.\n\n**Jaipur Literature Festival (2012)**\n\nIn 2012, Rushdie attended the Jaipur Literature Festival in India, where he delivered a lecture on the importance of free speech and literary expression. The event was met with protests and criticism from some Indian politicians and Islamic groups.\n\n**Chautauqua attack (2022)**\n\nOn August 12, 2022, Rushdie was attacked on stage at the Chautauqua Institution in New York State. The attacker, a 24-year-old man, was reportedly acting on a mistaken assumption about Rushdie's views on Islam.

Prior to his presidency, Putin served as the Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012, and as the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia from 1999 to 2000. He has also served as the Mayor of Saint Petersburg from 1990 to 1991.\n\n**Early life**\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). His father, Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin, was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, and his mother, Maria Shelomova, was a factory worker.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and was centered in the province of Abra. The quake caused widespread damage and affected several provinces in Luzon, with the death toll rising to over 200 people.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe 2022 Luzon earthquake occurred at 5:37 PM Philippine Standard Time (PST) on April 23, 2022. According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the epicenter of the earthquake was located in the municipality of Tayum, Abra. The quake had a depth of 10 kilometers and a moment magnitude of 7.3. It was described as a powerful and intense earthquake that caused widespread damage and panic in the affected areas.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nFollowing the main shock, several aftershocks were reported in the affected areas. The strongest aftershock had a magnitude of 6.2 and occurred on April 24, 2022. The aftershocks caused further damage and added to the anxiety of the affected communities.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake varied across different areas in Luzon. In Abra, the intensity reached as high as 8 on the Philippine intensity scale, with reports of collapsed buildings and damaged infrastructure. In other provinces, such as Ilocos Sur and Baguio, the intensity was lower, ranging from 5 to 6 on the Philippine intensity scale. Despite the variation in intensity, the earthquake caused widespread damage and disruption across Luzon.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nThere were no reports of a tsunami following the earthquake. However, the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its tsunami warning system as a precautionary measure. The warning was later lifted after it was determined that a tsunami was not imminent.\n\n## Liquefaction\n\nLiquefaction was reported in several areas, particularly in Abra and Ilocos Sur. The phenomenon, which occurs when shaking causes water-saturated soil to lose its strength and behave like a liquid, was responsible for some of the damage and flooding in the affected areas.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the earthquake was swift and coordinated. The Philippine government activated its disaster response mechanisms, with President Rodrigo Duterte declaring a state of calamity in several provinces. The NDRRMC was activated to coordinate the response efforts, which included search and rescue operations, provision of relief goods, and assessment of damage.\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community offered support and aid to the Philippines in the aftermath of the earthquake. Several countries, including Japan, the United States, and Australia, provided financial assistance and technical expertise to support the relief efforts. The European Union also offered support, providing funding for relief operations and infrastructure repair.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe impact of the earthquake was significant, with over 200 people killed and thousands more injured. The earthquake also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. In Abra, the damage was particularly severe, with entire communities affected by the quake.\n\n## Abra\n\nAbra was one of the provinces most affected by the earthquake. The province's capital, Bangued, was particularly hard hit, with many buildings collapsed and infrastructure damaged. The province's economic activities were severely disrupted, with many businesses and markets affected by the quake.\n\n## Baguio\n\nBaguio, the summer capital of the Philippines, was also affected by the earthquake. The city's infrastructure, including roads and buildings, was damaged, causing disruptions to daily life. The city's economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism, was also affected by the quake.\n\n## Ilocos Sur\n\nIlocos Sur was also affected by the earthquake, with damage reported in several areas. The province's infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was damaged, causing disruptions to daily life. The province's economic activities, including agriculture and tourism, were also affected by the quake.\n\n## Metro Manila\n\nMetro Manila, the capital region of the Philippines, was not directly affected by the earthquake. However, the city's residents were affected by the quake, with many people experiencing anxiety and disruption. The city's economy, which is heavily reliant on trade and commerce, was also affected by the quake.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nThe earthquake also affected other provinces in Luzon, including Benguet, La Union, and Pangasinan. The provinces' infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was damaged, causing disruptions to daily life. The provinces' economic activities, including agriculture and tourism, were also affected by the quake.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in the Philippines\n* Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology\n* Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council\n* Tsunami warning system\n* Liquefaction\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not contain any references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS)\n* Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC)\n* European Union's response to the 2022 Luzon earthquake", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Luzon_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Characteristics\n##Aftershocks\n##Intensity\n##Tsunami\n##Liquefaction\n#Response\n##International aid\n#Impact\n##Abra\n##Baguio\n##Ilocos Sur\n##Metro Manila\n##Elsewhere\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was a part of the biennial elections in Alabama, which were held to determine the membership of the Alabama House of Representatives and the Alabama Senate.\n\n**Retirements**\n\nSeveral members of the Alabama House of Representatives chose not to seek re-election in 2022. These include:\n\n### Republicans\n\n* **District 4:** Representative Steve Hurst announced his retirement from the Alabama House of Representatives after serving since 2002. Hurst was a strong supporter of conservative policies and was known for his advocacy on issues related to agriculture and rural development.\n* **District 15:** Representative Randy Davis announced his retirement from the Alabama House of Representatives after serving since 2010. Davis was a key figure in the Alabama House of Representatives and was known for his work on issues related to education and economic development.\n\n### Democrats\n\n* **District 27:** Representative Thad McClammy announced his retirement from the Alabama House of Representatives after serving since 2002. McClammy was a strong supporter of progressive policies and was known for his advocacy on issues related to healthcare and social justice.\n\n**Incumbents defeated**\n\nSeveral incumbent members of the Alabama House of Representatives were defeated in the 2022 election. These include:\n\n### Republicans\n\n* **District 12:** Representative Paul Lee was defeated by challenger Wes Allen in the Republican primary election. Lee was a strong supporter of conservative policies and was known for his advocacy on issues related to education and economic development.\n* **District 55:** Representative Reed Ingram was defeated by challenger Chris Sanks in the Republican primary election. Ingram was a key figure in the Alabama House of Representatives and was known for his work on issues related to agriculture and rural development.\n\n### Democrats\n\n* **District 64:** Representative Laura Hall was defeated by challenger K.L. Brown in the Democratic primary election. Hall was a strong supporter of progressive policies and was known for her advocacy on issues related to healthcare and social justice.\n\n**Predictions**\n\nThe 2022 election was anticipated to be a strong year for Republicans in Alabama, given the state's conservative leanings and the national trend of Republican victories in the 2022 midterm elections. However, the election ultimately saw a strong performance by Democrats in several key districts, which helped to maintain a competitive balance in the Alabama House of Representatives.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe final results of the 2022 Alabama House of Representatives election are as follows:\n\n* Republicans: 77 seats\n* Democrats: 23 seats\n\n**Closest races**\n\nThe following races were the closest in the 2022 Alabama House of Representatives election:\n\n* **District 12:** Wes Allen (R) defeated Paul Lee (R) by 0.5%\n* **District 55:** Chris Sanks (R) defeated Reed Ingram (R) by 0.2%\n* **District 64:** K.L. Brown (D) defeated Laura Hall (D) by 0.1%\n\n**Detailed results**\n\nThe following is a detailed breakdown of the results in each district:\n\n### District 1\n\n* Republican candidate: **Steve Clouse**\n* Democratic candidate: **Paula Little**\n\n### District 2\n\n* Republican candidate: **K.L.

The suspensions were widespread and affected various types of accounts, including those belonging to journalists, flight-tracking services, and other individuals.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn November 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, and subsequently, changes in the platform's moderation policies and content restrictions began to take effect. As Musk took control of the platform, some users began to express concerns about the potential for increased censorship and suppression of free speech.\n\n**Account suspensions**\n\nIn December 2022, Twitter began a series of account suspensions that affected hundreds of users. The suspensions were carried out using Twitter's \"Twitter Moderation Tools,\" a feature that allows the platform to automatically flag and suspend accounts that violate its rules.\n\n### Twitter policy changes\n\nTwitter's policy changes in the aftermath of Musk's acquisition led to increased scrutiny of the platform's moderation policies. Some of the changes included:\n\n*   A shift towards more lenient moderation policies, allowing for more explicit content to be shared on the platform\n*   A decrease in the number of moderators employed by Twitter, leading to concerns about the platform's ability to effectively enforce its rules\n*   A change in the way that Twitter handled appeals from suspended users, with some users reporting difficulty in having their accounts reinstated\n\nThese changes contributed to the widespread suspensions that took place in December 2022.\n\n### Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nOne of the most notable types of accounts suspended in December 2022 were flight-tracking accounts. These accounts, which were used by enthusiasts and professionals to track the movements of aircraft, were suspended due to a change in Twitter's policy on \"data scraping.\"\n\nTwitter's policy prohibits the use of automated tools to collect or scrape data from the platform, and some flight-tracking accounts were suspended for allegedly violating this policy.\n\n### Suspension of journalist accounts\n\nJournalists and media organizations were also affected by the suspensions. Some journalists reported having their accounts suspended after sharing articles or comments that criticized Elon Musk or Twitter's policies.\n\nThe suspensions of journalist accounts sparked widespread criticism, with many arguing that they were a threat to freedom of the press and the ability of journalists to report on important issues.\n\n### Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nTwitter and Elon Musk offered explanations for the suspensions, citing a need to enforce the platform's rules and protect users from harassment and abuse.\n\nHowever, many critics argued that the suspensions were overly broad and unfairly targeted certain types of users, such as journalists and flight-tracking enthusiasts.\n\n**Reinstatement of some accounts**\n\nIn the aftermath of the suspensions, some accounts were reinstated after users filed appeals with Twitter. However, many users reported difficulty in having their accounts reinstated, and some reported being suspended again after their accounts were reinstated.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe suspensions sparked a wide range of responses from users, journalists, and other commentators.\n\n### Suspended journalists\n\nSuspended journalists and media organizations spoke out against the suspensions, arguing that they were a threat to freedom of the press and the ability of journalists to report on important issues.\n\nSome journalists reported having their accounts suspended after sharing articles or comments that criticized Elon Musk or Twitter's policies.\n\n### Other commentators\n\nOther commentators, including politicians and celebrities, also spoke out against the suspensions. Some argued that the suspensions were a result of Twitter's new ownership and a shift in the platform's moderation policies.\n\nOthers argued that the suspensions were a result of a desire by Elon Musk to silence critics and opposition to his views.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Twitter's moderation policies**\n*   **Freedom of the press**\n*   **Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter**\n*   **Twitter's impact on society**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It involves the coordination of policies, laws, and institutions among European countries to achieve common goals, strengthen economic ties, and promote peace and stability. The concept of European integration has evolved over time, with various phases and theories shaping its development. This article provides an overview of the history, theories, and scope of European integration, as well as its future prospects.\n\nHistory\n\nEuropean integration has a long history, with various periods and phases shaping its development.\n\nProto-integration period\n\nThe idea of European integration dates back to the 16th century, when European powers such as France and the Holy Roman Empire formed alliances to counterbalance the power of the Ottoman Empire. However, these early attempts at integration were limited and short-lived.\n\nFirst phase: explaining integration, 1960s onwards\n\nThe modern concept of European integration began to take shape in the 1960s, with the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. This treaty established the European Economic Community (EEC), which aimed to create a common market and customs union among its member states. The EEC was later reformed and expanded through the Single European Act (1986) and the Maastricht Treaty (1992), which introduced the concept of a single currency, the euro.\n\nSecond phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe 1980s saw a shift in focus from economic integration to governance and policy coordination. The Single European Act introduced the concept of mutual recognition and non-discrimination, while the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union (EU) and introduced the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.\n\nThird phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe 1990s saw the consolidation of the EU, with the introduction of the Schengen Area (1995) and the eurozone (1999). The Lisbon Treaty (2007) further reformed the EU, introducing a more integrated and cohesive structure.\n\nCitizens' organisations calling for further integration\n\nThere are various citizens' organisations that promote European integration and advocate for further cooperation among EU member states.

The ship was originally laid down in 1976 as the lead ship of her class, and was commissioned into the Soviet Navy in 1983. The Moskva played a significant role in the Russian Navy's fleet, serving in various capacities throughout its career.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Moskva was one of the most advanced warships in the Russian Navy during its service, equipped with a range of sophisticated sensors and anti-ship missiles. The ship's career spanned over three decades, during which it played a key role in several significant naval operations. This article provides an overview of the Moskva's history, from its commissioning in 1983 to its sinking in 2022.\n\n**As Slava**\n\nThe Moskva was originally laid down in 1976 at the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev, Ukraine, as the lead ship of the Slava-class guided missile cruiser. The ship was designed to serve as a multi-purpose cruiser, capable of engaging both air and surface targets. The Moskva was equipped with a range of sensors, including the P-1000 Vodopad fire control radar system and the Shtil-1 surface-to-air missile system. The ship's primary anti-ship missile system was the P-500 P-1000 Vodopad, which was capable of engaging targets at a range of up to 600 km.\n\nThe Moskva was commissioned into the Soviet Navy in 1983, and was initially assigned to the Black Sea Fleet. The ship played a key role in several significant naval exercises and operations during this period, including the 1985 Soviet naval intervention in the Mediterranean in support of the Syrian government. The Moskva was also involved in the 1987 Soviet naval exercise in the North Atlantic, which involved a fleet of ships from the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.\n\n**As Moskva**\n\nIn 1991, the Moskva was renamed after the Russian city of Moscow, which was previously the capital of the Soviet Union. The ship underwent a significant refit during this period, which included the installation of a new anti-ship missile system and the upgrading of its sensors and command systems. The Moskva was also repainted in the new Russian Navy colors and had its original Soviet-era decals replaced with new Russian Navy insignia.\n\nThe Moskva continued to serve in the Russian Navy throughout the 1990s and 2000s, playing a key role in several significant naval operations. In 2008, the ship participated in the Russian naval intervention in Georgia, which was sparked by a conflict between Russian-backed separatists and the government of Georgia. The Moskva was also involved in the 2014 Russian naval exercises in the Black Sea, which involved a fleet of ships from the Russian Navy and its allies.\n\n**Russian invasion of Ukraine**\n\nIn 2022, the Moskva was involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which was sparked by a conflict between Russian-backed separatists and the government of Ukraine. The ship played a key role in the Russian naval campaign in the Black Sea, which involved a fleet of ships from the Russian Navy and its allies.\n\n**Snake Island campaign**\n\nThe Moskva was involved in the 2022 Russian naval campaign in the Snake Island, which is located in the Black Sea and is home to a Ukrainian military base. The ship played a key role in the Russian naval assault on the island, which was launched on February 24, 2022. The Moskva engaged Ukrainian naval forces and air defenses, providing fire support to Russian ground troops as they landed on the island.\n\n**Sinking**\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the Moskva sank in the Black Sea after being hit by two Neptune anti-ship missiles launched by the Ukrainian military. The ship was on a mission to support Russian ground troops in the Kherson region of Ukraine when it was struck by the missiles. The Moskva sank in shallow water, but was badly damaged and was eventually declared a total loss.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva marked a significant turning point in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and was widely seen as a major setback for the Russian Navy. The loss of the ship also marked a significant blow to Russian morale, and was widely reported in the media.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Moskva was a significant warship in the Russian Navy, and played a key role in several significant naval operations throughout its career. The ship's sinking in 2022 marked a significant turning point in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and was widely seen as a major setback for the Russian Navy.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations, as the information is based on publicly available sources and is intended to provide a general overview of the Moskva's history.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Russian Navy official website\n* Black Sea Shipyard official website\n* Ukraine's Ministry of Defense official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
