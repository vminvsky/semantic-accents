The scheme was announced by the Ministry of Defence on 14 June 2022, and its implementation has been met with both praise and criticism from various quarters.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in recruiting youth due to a combination of factors such as increasing competition from other career options, lack of awareness about the Armed Forces as a career, and the relatively low age limit for recruitment. To address these issues, the Ministry of Defence decided to introduce a new recruitment policy, which would provide a career path for youth to join the Armed Forces while also addressing the concerns of the existing workforce.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme aims to provide a career path for 46.8% of the youth in the Indian Armed Forces, who will be recruited for a period of three to four years, depending on their performance. During this period, they will receive training and be deployed for operational duties. After completing their initial engagement, they will be given a four-year tenure as shakhti (reserve) personnel, during which they will be called up for various duties and responsibilities. The remaining 53.2% of the youth will be recruited for a permanent engagement, with a minimum tenure of 15 years.\n\n## Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides for reservation of 10% of the total recruitment quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society. The scheme also provides for welfare benefits such as medical insurance, education loan, and skill development training to the Agniveers (recruits).\n\n## Criticism\n\n### By political parties and activists\n\nSeveral political parties and activists have criticized the Agnipath Scheme, citing concerns about the short tenure of the Agniveers, the lack of job security, and the potential impact on the morale of the existing workforce. They have also raised concerns about the potential for the scheme to be used as a means of reducing the strength of the Armed Forces and increasing the dependence on private security agencies.\n\n### By retired defence personnel\n\nRetired defence personnel have also criticized the Agnipath Scheme, citing concerns about the potential impact on the morale of the existing workforce and the potential for the scheme to be used as a means of reducing the strength of the Armed Forces. They have also raised concerns about the lack of job security and the potential for the Agniveers to leave the service after completing their initial engagement.\n\n### By state governments\n\nSeveral state governments have also criticized the Agnipath Scheme, citing concerns about the potential impact on the youth of the state and the potential for the scheme to be used as a means of reducing the strength of the Armed Forces. They have also raised concerns about the lack of job security and the potential for the Agniveers to leave the service after completing their initial engagement.\n\n### Data on employment of veterans\n\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Defence, the employment rate of veterans in the civil sector is around 70%, while the employment rate of veterans in the private sector is around 30%. The data also shows that the majority of veterans are employed in the services sector, followed by the manufacturing sector.\n\n## Protests\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been met with protests across the country, with thousands of youth and defence personnel taking to the streets to express their opposition to the scheme. The protests have been marked by clashes between police and protesters, with several injuries reported.\n\n### Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nThe Bharat Bandh (All India Strike) was called by several opposition parties and trade unions to protest against the Agnipath Scheme. The strike was observed on 3 June, with thousands of people taking to the streets to express their opposition to the scheme.\n\n### 21 June onwards\n\nThe protests against the Agnipath Scheme continued on 21 June, with thousands of youth and defence personnel taking to the streets to express their opposition to the scheme. The protests were marked by clashes between police and protesters, with several injuries reported.\n\n## Response by the Government\n\nThe Government has responded to the protests against the Agnipath Scheme by stating that the scheme is necessary to modernize the Armed Forces and provide a career path for youth. The Government has also stated that the scheme will be reviewed and modified based on feedback from the public and defence personnel.\n\n## Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n\nA plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, citing concerns about the potential impact on the morale of the existing workforce and the potential for the scheme to be used as a means of reducing the strength of the Armed Forces.\n\n## First Agniveer batch (2023)\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was recruited in 2023, with a total of 4500 recruits selected from across the country. The recruits underwent training at various training centers, including the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun.\n\n### Hyderabad\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers was recruited in Hyderabad, with a total of 1500 recruits selected from the city. The recruits underwent training at the Army’s Training Command in Hyderabad.\n\n### Nashik\n\nThe second batch of Agniveers was recruited in Nashik, with a total of 1500 recruits selected from the city. The recruits underwent training at the Army’s Training Command in Nashik.\n\n### Ranikhet\n\nThe third batch of Agniveers was recruited in Ranikhet, with a total of 1500 recruits selected from the city. The recruits underwent training at the Army’s Training Command in Ranikhet.\n\n## Amendment in recruitment procedure\n\nThe Government has made an amendment to the recruitment procedure for the Agniveers, with the new procedure coming into effect from 2023. The new procedure includes a written test, a physical fitness test, and a medical examination for the recruits.\n\n## See also\n\n* Indian Armed Forces\n* Recruitment in the Indian Armed Forces\n* Indian Military Academy\n\n## External links\n\n* Ministry of Defence, Government of India\n* Indian Armed Forces", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Agnipath_Scheme\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Overview\n#Reservation and welfare benefits\n#Criticism\n##By political parties and activists\n##By retired defence personnel\n##By state governments\n##Data on employment of veterans\n#Protests\n##Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n##21 June onwards\n#Response by the Government\n#Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n#First Agniveer batch (2023)\n##Hyderabad\n##Nashik\n##Ranikhet\n#Amendment in recruitment procedure\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or a Cartier tree. The data structure is named after its inventor, Peter Fenwick.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nFenwick trees are designed to solve problems that require efficient updates and range queries on arrays. They are particularly useful in applications where the array is large and the range of elements to be updated or queried is small. Fenwick trees are often used in computational geometry, algorithms, and data structures.\n\n**Description**\n\nA Fenwick tree consists of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is used to answer range queries on the array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a range of elements in the array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a disjoint subset of the elements in the parent node.\n\nThe interrogation tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into smaller subsets until each subset contains only one element. This process is called the \"range decomposition\" of the array.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is used to update individual elements in the array. It is also a binary tree, but its nodes represent the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n\nEach node in the update tree has a value equal to the sum of the values in the corresponding subset of elements. When an update is made to the array, the update tree is modified accordingly.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is used to search for a specific element in the array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a range of elements in the array.\n\nThe search tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into smaller subsets until each subset contains only one element. This process is similar to the range decomposition of the array.\n\n**Pseudocode**\n\n### Construction\n\nHere is a pseudocode for constructing a Fenwick tree:\n```\nfunction constructFenwickTree(array):\n  n = length of array\n  interrogationTree = new binary tree\n  updateTree = new binary tree\n  searchTree = new binary tree\n\n  for i = 0 to n - 1:\n    node = new node in interrogationTree\n    node.range = array[i]\n    node.leftChild = null\n    node.rightChild = null\n\n    node = new node in updateTree\n    node.value = array[i]\n    node.leftChild = null\n    node.rightChild = null\n\n    node = new node in searchTree\n    node.range = array[i]\n    node.leftChild = null\n    node.rightChild = null\n\n  for i = n - 1 to 0:\n    for j = i - 1 to 0:\n      if array[j] <= array[i]:\n        interrogationTree[i].range.add(array[j])\n        updateTree[i].value += array[j]\n      else:\n        break\n\n  return interrogationTree, updateTree, searchTree\n```\n**See Also**\n\n* Binary Indexed Tree\n* Range Tree\n* Cartesian Tree\n* Segment Tree\n\n**References**\n\nNone.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Fenwick Tree on Wikipedia (in other languages)\n* Fenwick Tree on Code Project\n* Fenwick Tree on GeeksforGeeks", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fenwick_tree\" following this outline:\n\n#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist who played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, known for his work on theoretical physics, particularly in the fields of quantum mechanics and relativity.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood and Education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer. His father was a textile importer, and the family lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Oppenheimer's early education took place at the Ethical Culture School in Manhattan, where he developed a strong interest in science and mathematics.\n\nIn 1921, Oppenheimer enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied chemistry and physics. During his time at Harvard, he became fascinated with the work of Albert Einstein and the development of quantum mechanics. He graduated in 1925 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and then moved to Europe to pursue further studies.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nOppenheimer spent the next several years studying at the University of Cambridge and the University of Göttingen. At Cambridge, he worked under the supervision of J.J. Thomson, a Nobel laureate in physics. In 1927, Oppenheimer moved to Göttingen, where he worked under the supervision of Max Born, another renowned physicist.\n\nDuring his time in Europe, Oppenheimer became increasingly interested in theoretical physics, particularly in the fields of quantum mechanics and relativity. He developed a close relationship with Werner Heisenberg, a fellow physicist and future Nobel laureate. The two men collaborated on several projects, including a paper on the uncertainty principle, which was published in 1927.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn 1930, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and took up a teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a leading figure in the field of theoretical physics, and attracted a number of talented students to his department.\n\nIn 1935, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley. He held this position until 1942, when he was recruited by the U.S. government to work on the Manhattan Project.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\nThroughout his academic career, Oppenheimer was a prolific researcher, publishing numerous papers on theoretical physics. He worked on a wide range of topics, including quantum mechanics, relativity, and nuclear physics.\n\nIn the 1930s, Oppenheimer became increasingly interested in the work of Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist who had developed the concept of complementarity. Oppenheimer saw complementarity as a way to understand the relationship between wave and particle behavior in quantum mechanics. He published a series of papers on the subject, which helped to establish him as a leading figure in the field.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a vocal critic of fascism and nationalism, and was deeply concerned about the rise of Hitler in Germany. In the 1930s, he became increasingly involved in politics, joining the American Communist Party in 1938.\n\nHowever, Oppenheimer's politics were complex and nuanced. He was a strong supporter of the Soviet Union, but he also recognized the dangers of Soviet totalitarianism. In 1943, he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, denying any involvement in communist activities.\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nIn 1940, Oppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a former Communist Party member and friend of the Oppenheimer family. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter.\n\nOppenheimer's relationships with his family were complex and often strained. His marriage to Kitty was marked by infidelity and tension, and his relationships with his children were often distant and troubled.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nThroughout his life, Oppenheimer was drawn to mysticism and the occult. He was particularly interested in the work of Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist who had developed the concept of the collective unconscious.\n\nIn the 1940s, Oppenheimer became increasingly interested in Eastern spirituality, particularly in the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism. He saw these traditions as a way to understand the nature of reality and the human condition.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited by the U.S. government to work on the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project aimed at creating an atomic bomb. He was appointed as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, a research facility in New Mexico.\n\nAt Los Alamos, Oppenheimer worked alongside a team of scientists, including Enrico Fermi, Ernest Lawrence, and Richard Feynman. Together, they developed the theoretical framework for the bomb, including the concept of nuclear fission and the design of the first test device.\n\n### Bomb Design\n\nOppenheimer played a crucial role in the design of the first atomic bomb, working closely with the engineers and technicians at Los Alamos. He was responsible for developing the theoretical framework for the bomb, including the concept of critical mass and the design of the bomb's trigger mechanism.\n\nIn 1945, Oppenheimer and his team conducted a series of experiments at Los Alamos, including a test of the first plutonium bomb. The test, known as Trinity, was a success, but it also had a profound impact on Oppenheimer, who later described the experience as a \"technological sublime.\"\n\n### Trinity\n\nThe Trinity test was conducted on July 16, 1945, in the Jornada del Muerto desert in New Mexico. The test device, known as the \"Gadget,\" was a plutonium bomb that was designed to simulate the effects of a nuclear explosion.\n\nThe test was a success, but it also had a profound impact on Oppenheimer, who later described the experience as a \"technological sublime.\" He was deeply moved by the power and beauty of the explosion, and he saw it as a reminder of the dangers of nuclear war.\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer returned to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had been a member since 1947. He continued to work on theoretical physics, publishing a number of papers on the subject.\n\nIn the 1950s, Oppenheimer became increasingly involved in the development of nuclear energy policy, serving on a number of government advisory committees and commissions.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1953, Oppenheimer was appointed as the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, a position he held until 1963. During his tenure, he was a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation and a strong advocate for international cooperation on nuclear energy issues.\n\n### Panels and Study Groups\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, Oppenheimer served on a number of government panels and study groups, including the President's Science Advisory Committee and the National Academy of Sciences. He was a vocal advocate for the importance of science in public policy and a strong critic of nuclear proliferation.\n\n### Security Hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was subjected to a security hearing by the Atomic Energy Commission, which was accused of being a communist sympathizer. The hearing was a result of a campaign by Senator Joseph McCarthy and his supporters to discredit Oppenheimer and remove him from his position at the AEC.\n\nThe hearing was a highly publicized and contentious event, with Oppenheimer facing accusations of being a communist sympathizer and a security risk. However, he was ultimately cleared of all charges and continued to serve on the AEC.\n\n**Final Years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, a prestigious award for contributions to nuclear energy. He was recognized for his work on the Manhattan Project and his subsequent contributions to the development of nuclear energy policy.\n\n### Death\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to throat cancer. He was buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a complex and multifaceted figure, known for his contributions to theoretical physics, his leadership on the Manhattan Project, and his commitment to public service. He was a vocal advocate for the importance of science in public policy and a strong critic of nuclear proliferation.\n\nThroughout his life, Oppenheimer was known for his intellectual curiosity and his passion for learning. He was a true polymath, with interests in a wide range of subjects, including physics, mathematics, philosophy, and literature.\n\nIn the years following his death, Oppenheimer's legacy has been the subject of much debate and discussion. Some have praised his contributions to science and his commitment to public service, while others have criticized his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb and his role in the Cold War.\n\n**Publications**\n\nOppenheimer published numerous papers on theoretical physics, including a series of papers on quantum mechanics and relativity. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"On the Theory of the Relativistic Free Electron\" (1928)\n* \"The Quantum Theory of the Electron\" (1929)\n* \"The Uncertainty Principle\" (1927) (with Werner Heisenberg)\n* \"On the Theory of Nuclear Fission\" (1939) (with Enrico Fermi)\n* \"The Nature of the Atomic Bomb\" (1945) (with Ernest Lawrence)\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and work. It is based on a wide range of sources, including his published papers, biographies, and historical accounts.\n\n**References**\n\n* Abraham Pais, \"J.

This article provides an overview of the history of Finland's relations with NATO, its current status, and its foreign relations with other NATO member states.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFinland's geographical location in Northern Europe, bordering Russia, has historically influenced its foreign policy and security priorities. For decades, the country maintained a policy of neutrality, avoiding military alliances and focusing on economic and diplomatic relations with other countries. However, the changing global security landscape, particularly the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, prompted Finland to reassess its security options and consider joining NATO. This article will explore the history of Finland's relations with NATO, its recent accession process, and its current status as a member of the alliance.\n\n**#History**\n\n###Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFinland's neutrality policy was established in the aftermath of World War II, following the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union (1939-1944). The Finnish government sought to maintain good relations with both the Soviet Union and the Western powers, while avoiding military alliances. This policy was formalized in 1948 with the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union, which included a mutual defense commitment in the event of an attack by a third country.\n\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland maintained its policy of neutrality, participating in international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The country's economic ties with the Soviet Union remained strong, and it played a key role in mediating between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Finland's military policy focused on defense, with an emphasis on national defense capabilities rather than participation in collective defense arrangements.\n\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe end of the Cold War marked a significant shift in Finland's foreign policy priorities. The country began to reassess its relationships with the Soviet Union and other European countries, seeking to establish closer economic and political ties with Western Europe. Finland applied for membership in the European Union (EU) in 1992 and joined the EU in 1995, marking a significant shift towards greater integration with Western Europe.\n\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nFollowing its accession to the EU, Finland continued to maintain its policy of neutrality, but its security priorities began to shift towards greater cooperation with other European countries. Finland participated in the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), which aimed to create a more robust European defense capability. The country also participated in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, which aimed to promote cooperation between NATO member states and partner countries.\n\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy priorities. The Finnish government announced its intention to apply for NATO membership, citing the need for greater security cooperation with other European countries. The application process was formally launched in May 2022, with the submission of a membership action plan to NATO. The plan outlined Finland's commitment to NATO's core principles and its willingness to contribute to the alliance's defense capabilities.\n\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Finland's government announced its intention to increase its military spending and enhance its defense capabilities. The country also participated in international efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine and impose economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's parliament voted in favor of a resolution to apply for NATO membership. The government submitted a membership action plan to NATO in June 2022, outlining Finland's commitment to the alliance's core principles and its willingness to contribute to the alliance's defense capabilities.\n\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nThe membership action plan was reviewed by NATO member states, with a focus on Finland's defense capabilities and its commitment to the alliance's core principles. Finland's parliament ratified the membership action plan in April 2023, marking a significant step towards NATO membership.\n\n**2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO**\n\nFinland's accession to NATO was formally approved by the alliance's member states in April 2023. The country's membership was ratified by the Finnish parliament in May 2023, marking a significant shift in its foreign policy priorities. Finland's membership in NATO is expected to enhance its security cooperation with other European countries and contribute to the alliance's defense capabilities.\n\n**Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states**\n\nFinland's membership in NATO is expected to strengthen its bilateral relations with other NATO member states. The country has already established close ties with several NATO member states, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Finland's participation in NATO's defense planning and operations is also expected to enhance its cooperation with other member states.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Finland's foreign policy\n* History of Finland's foreign relations\n* European Union–NATO relations\n* Russian–Finnish relations\n\n**References**\n\n(No references are provided in this article)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n(No bibliography is provided in this article)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Finnish Ministry of Defence: Finland's NATO membership\n* NATO: Finland's membership action plan\n* European Council: Finland's EU membership\n* Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland: Finland's foreign policy priorities", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term is often used to refer to a specific activity or procedure that is prohibited by law or societal norms.\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe sensitive topics has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. Euphemisms were used to avoid offending or shocking those who might hear or read the words. In modern times, the use of euphemisms has become more widespread, particularly with the advent of social media and the internet.\n\n### \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nIn the 1960s, the term \"the thing that had no name\" was used to describe the act of abortion, which was a highly sensitive and taboo topic at the time. The phrase was coined by a group of women who were seeking to make the procedure more accessible and to reduce the stigma associated with it. The term was later adopted by activists and healthcare providers to refer to the procedure.\n\n### Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe use of euphemisms to describe abortion has been seen in various forms of print media. In the 19th century, the term \"the operation\" was used to refer to the procedure. In the 20th century, terms such as \"termination of pregnancy\" and \"medical termination\" gained popularity. The use of euphemisms has continued to evolve, with terms such as \"pregnancy termination\" and \"abortional services\" being used in modern times.\n\n**Law**\n\nThe use of euphemisms in law has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. Euphemisms were used to avoid offending or shocking those who might hear or read the words. In modern times, the use of euphemisms has become more widespread, particularly with the advent of social media and the internet.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the use of euphemisms to describe sensitive topics is prohibited by law. For example, in some countries, the use of euphemisms to describe abortion is prohibited by law, with strict penalties for those who use such terms.\n\n**Art**\n\n### Film\n\nThe use of euphemisms in film has been a topic of interest for many directors and producers. Euphemisms have been used to avoid offending or shocking audiences, while still conveying the intended message. In some films, euphemisms have been used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty, leaving the audience to interpret the meaning.\n\nFor example, in the film \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" the term \"the Ceremony\" is used to describe the act of forced prostitution. The use of the euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity, leaving the audience to interpret the meaning.\n\n### Television\n\nThe use of euphemisms in television has also been a topic of interest for many producers and writers. Euphemisms have been used to avoid offending or shocking audiences, while still conveying the intended message. In some television shows, euphemisms have been used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty, leaving the audience to interpret the meaning.\n\nFor example, in the television show \"The Sopranos,\" the term \"the thing\" is used to describe the act of murder. The use of the euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity, leaving the audience to interpret the meaning.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nThe use of euphemisms in sculpture has been a topic of interest for many artists. Euphemisms have been used to avoid offending or shocking viewers, while still conveying the intended message. In some sculptures, euphemisms have been used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty, leaving the viewer to interpret the meaning.\n\nFor example, in the sculpture \"The Thinker,\" the artist uses a euphemism to describe the act of thinking. The use of the euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity, leaving the viewer to interpret the meaning.\n\n### Fiction\n\nThe use of euphemisms in fiction has been a topic of interest for many authors. Euphemisms have been used to avoid offending or shocking readers, while still conveying the intended message. In some fiction, euphemisms have been used to create a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty, leaving the reader to interpret the meaning.\n\nFor example, in the novel \"1984,\" the term \"the thing\" is used to describe the act of rebellion. The use of the euphemism creates a sense of ambiguity, leaving the reader to interpret the meaning.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of euphemisms to describe sensitive topics has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. Euphemisms have been used to avoid offending or shocking those who might hear or read the words. In modern times, the use of euphemisms has become more widespread, particularly with the advent of social media and the internet.

The grade is typically expressed as a number or a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols, and is used to communicate the level of challenge and risk associated with a particular climb. In this article, we will explore the various grading systems used in climbing, including their history, characteristics, and differences.\n\n# **History**\n\nThe concept of grading climbs dates back to the early days of mountaineering. In the 19th century, climbers used descriptive terms such as \"easy,\" \"difficult,\" and \"impossible\" to describe the challenges they faced on the mountain. However, as climbing techniques and equipment improved, the need for a more standardized and objective grading system became apparent.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, various grading systems emerged, each with its own set of numbers, letters, and symbols. The most influential of these was the French numerical grade, which was developed in the 1950s by the French Alpine Club. This system used a single number from 1 to 9, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.\n\n## **Free climbing**\n\nFree climbing is a style of climbing that involves ascending a route without the aid of equipment such as ropes, ladders, or artificial holds. Free climbing grades are typically used to rate the difficulty of a route, taking into account factors such as the physical demands of the climb, the risk of falls, and the level of technical difficulty.\n\n### **French numerical grade**\n\nThe French numerical grade is one of the most widely used grading systems in the world. It uses a single number from 1 to 9, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* 1: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* 2-3: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* 4-5: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* 6-7: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* 8: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* 9: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **American YDS grade**\n\nThe American YDS (Yosemite Decimal System) grade is a grading system used in the United States. It uses a combination of numbers and letters, with higher numbers and letters indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* Class 1: Easy, suitable for beginners\n* Class 2: Easy to moderate, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* Class 3: Moderate to difficult, suitable for experienced climbers\n* Class 4: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* Class 5: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* Class 5.0: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **UIAA scale**\n\nThe UIAA (Union of International Alpine Associations) scale is a grading system used in Europe. It uses a combination of numbers and letters, with higher numbers and letters indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* F: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* PD: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* AD: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* D: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* ED: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* TD: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **British E-grade**\n\nThe British E-grade is a grading system used in the United Kingdom. It uses a single letter, with higher letters indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* E1: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* E2: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* E3: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* E4: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* E5: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* E6: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **Other notable systems**\n\nOther notable grading systems include the Swiss grading system, which uses a combination of numbers and letters, and the Canadian grading system, which uses a combination of numbers and letters.\n\n# **Bouldering**\n\nBouldering is a style of climbing that involves ascending short, lower-level routes without the aid of equipment such as ropes or harnesses. Bouldering grades are typically used to rate the difficulty of a route, taking into account factors such as the physical demands of the climb and the level of technical difficulty.\n\n## **Comparison with free climbing**\n\nBouldering grades are often compared to free climbing grades, with bouldering grades typically being higher than free climbing grades for the same level of difficulty. This is because bouldering routes are often shorter and more physically demanding than free climbing routes.\n\n### **Font grade**\n\nThe Font grade is a grading system used in bouldering. It uses a combination of numbers and letters, with higher numbers and letters indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* Font 1: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* Font 2: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* Font 3: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* Font 4: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* Font 5: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* Font 6: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **V-grade**\n\nThe V-grade is a grading system used in bouldering. It uses a single number, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* V0: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* V1: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* V2: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* V3: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* V4: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* V5: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **Other notable systems**\n\nOther notable bouldering grading systems include the Australian bouldering grading system and the New Zealand bouldering grading system.\n\n# **Aid climbing**\n\nAid climbing is a style of climbing that involves ascending a route using equipment such as ropes, ladders, and artificial holds. Aid climbing grades are typically used to rate the difficulty of a route, taking into account factors such as the physical demands of the climb, the risk of falls, and the level of technical difficulty.\n\n## **Instability of aid grades**\n\nAid climbing grades are often considered to be unstable and subject to change over time. This is because aid climbing techniques and equipment are constantly evolving, and the difficulty of a route may be affected by factors such as the quality of the rock and the experience of the climber.\n\n### **Original A-grade**\n\nThe original A-grade was developed in the 1970s and used a combination of numbers and letters to rate the difficulty of aid climbing routes. The grades were as follows:\n\n* A0: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* A1: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* A2: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* A3: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* A4: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* A5: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **New wave A-grade**\n\nThe new wave A-grade was developed in the 1980s and used a combination of numbers and letters to rate the difficulty of aid climbing routes. The grades were as follows:\n\n* A0+: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* A1+: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* A2+: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* A3+: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* A4+: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* A5+: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n### **Clean C-grade**\n\nThe clean C-grade is a grading system used in aid climbing. It uses a single letter, with higher letters indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* C0: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* C1: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* C2: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* C3: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* C4: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* C5: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n# **Ice and mixed climbing**\n\nIce and mixed climbing are styles of climbing that involve ascending routes using equipment such as crampons and ice axes. Ice and mixed climbing grades are typically used to rate the difficulty of a route, taking into account factors such as the physical demands of the climb, the risk of falls, and the level of technical difficulty.\n\n## **WI-grade**\n\nThe WI-grade is a grading system used in ice climbing. It uses a combination of numbers and letters, with higher numbers and letters indicating greater difficulty. The grades are as follows:\n\n* WI1: Very easy, suitable for beginners\n* WI2: Easy, suitable for intermediate climbers\n* WI3: Moderate, suitable for experienced climbers\n* WI4: Difficult, suitable for advanced climbers\n* WI5: Extremely difficult, suitable for expert climbers\n* WI6: Extremely difficult, not recommended for anyone except the most experienced climbers\n\n## **M-grade**\n\nThe M-grade is a grading system used in mixed climbing.

He was a prominent figure in the scientific community of his time, known for his contributions to the field of natural history, his support of Darwinism and natural selection, and his work as a curator and administrator at the Australian Museum.\n\n# Family\n\n## Education\n\nKrefft was born in Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany, on December 19, 1830. He received his early education in Germany and later moved to England to pursue his studies in natural history. He attended the University of London and later worked as a collector and naturalist for the British Museum.\n\n## Marriage\n\nIn 1858, Krefft married Julia Augusta Wemyss (1832-1917), a Scottish-born woman. The couple had four children together, including a son who died in infancy.\n\n## German heritage\n\nKrefft maintained strong ties to his German heritage throughout his life. He was fluent in German and often corresponded with German scientists and naturalists. His love for German culture and language was evident in his writings and public presentations.\n\n# Natural history\n\n## Darwinian doctrine\n\nKrefft was a strong supporter of Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. He saw the theory as a fundamental explanation for the diversity of life on Earth and the adaptation of organisms to their environments.\n\n## Darwinian controversy\n\nThe Darwinian controversy, which raged throughout the 19th century, centered on the validity of Darwin's theory. Krefft, along with many other scientists and naturalists, was a vocal supporter of the theory. He saw it as a groundbreaking explanation for the natural world and a fundamental understanding of the process of evolution.\n\n## Evolution\n\nKrefft saw evolution as a gradual process, where species adapted to their environments over time. He believed that the process of natural selection played a key role in the development of new species and the adaptation of existing ones.\n\n## Natural selection\n\nKrefft was a strong advocate for the concept of natural selection. He saw it as a fundamental driver of evolution, where individuals with advantageous traits were more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\n## Ellegård's five \"positions\" held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy\n\nIn his work, Ellegård identified five distinct positions held by scientists in the Darwinian controversy.

The mission marked the first public test of the Starship system, a next-generation spacecraft designed for lunar and interplanetary missions.\n\nBackground\n\nStarship\n\nStarship is a reusable spacecraft being developed by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company founded by Elon Musk. The spacecraft is designed to carry both crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. Starship is intended to be a critical component of SpaceX's lunar and interplanetary transportation architecture.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe development of Starship began in 2012, with the first prototype, known as the Grasshopper, being tested in 2013. Over the years, the design and development of Starship have undergone significant changes, with the current version being a more complex and sophisticated spacecraft.\n\nOpinions before launch\n\nIn the months leading up to the first flight test, there was significant public interest and speculation about the mission's objectives and potential outcomes. Some experts and space enthusiasts expressed concerns about the technical challenges and risks associated with the test, while others were more optimistic about the potential for a successful launch.\n\nTest objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the Starship Flight Test 1 mission were to test the performance and functionality of the spacecraft's propulsion system, guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, as well as to validate the overall design and integration of the vehicle.\n\nLaunch\n\nFlight Profile\n\nThe Starship Flight Test 1 mission was launched from the SpaceX Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, at 8:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) on 20 April 2023. The spacecraft reached an altitude of approximately 12.5 kilometers (7.8 miles) before falling back to Earth and landing safely in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFlight Timeline\n\nThe flight timeline was as follows:\n\n* T+0:00: The spacecraft lifted off from the launch pad.\n* T+0:10: The spacecraft reached an altitude of 1 kilometer (0.6 miles).\n* T+0:30: The spacecraft reached an altitude of 5 kilometers (3.1 miles).\n* T+1:00: The spacecraft reached an altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).\n* T+1:30: The spacecraft reached an altitude of 12.5 kilometers (7.8 miles).\n* T+2:00: The spacecraft began its descent back to Earth.\n* T+2:30: The spacecraft landed safely in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nApril 17, 2023 Attempt\n\nPrior to the successful launch on April 20, SpaceX attempted to launch the Starship on April 17, 2023. However, the mission was scrubbed due to technical issues with the launch vehicle.\n\nApril 20, 2023, 2nd Attempt\n\nThe second attempt on April 20, 2023, was successful, with the spacecraft launching at 8:00 a.m. CDT and reaching its intended altitude.\n\nAftermath\n\nTechnical Assessments\n\nThe technical assessments of the flight test were generally positive, with the spacecraft performing as expected and validating the design and integration of the vehicle. However, some minor issues were identified, which will be addressed in future updates.\n\nLaunch Site\n\nThe launch site, located at the SpaceX Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, played a critical role in the success of the mission. The facility provided a safe and controlled environment for the launch and recovery of the spacecraft.\n\nEffects on Environment\n\nThe launch and recovery of the Starship spacecraft had minimal effects on the environment, with the spacecraft landing safely in the Gulf of Mexico and causing no significant damage or disruption to the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nFAA Investigation\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is conducting a comprehensive investigation into the flight test, which will assess the safety and regulatory compliance of the mission. The investigation is ongoing, with results expected to be released in the coming weeks.\n\nSee also\n\n* SpaceX Starship\n* Boca Chica, Texas\n* Gulf of Mexico\n* Federal Aviation Administration\n\nNotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Starship_flight_test_1\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Starship\n##Development\n##Opinions before launch\n##Test objectives\n#Launch\n##Flight profile\n##Flight timeline\n##April 17 2023 attempt\n##April 20, 2023, 2nd attempt\n#Aftermath\n##Technical assessments\n##Launch site\n##Effects on environment\n##FAA investigation\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The dynasty's origins date back to the pre-Norman Conquest period, and it was instrumental in shaping the course of Welsh politics and society.\n\n**Aberffraw hundred (cantref)**\n\nThe Aberffraw hundred, also known as the cantref of Aberffraw, was a territorial division in northwest Wales that formed the power base of the House of Aberffraw. Located on the island of Anglesey, the cantref was bounded by the Menai Strait to the south and the Irish Sea to the north. The name \"Aberffraw\" is derived from the Welsh words \"aber\" meaning \"estuary\" and \"ffraw\" meaning \"crowded\" or \" densely populated place\".\n\nThe cantref was an important agricultural region, with fertile soil and a mild climate that allowed for the cultivation of crops such as wheat, barley, and oats. The area was also rich in natural resources, including timber, stone, and fish.\n\n**Welsh dynasties**\n\nThe House of Aberffraw was one of several powerful Welsh dynasties that emerged during the medieval period. These dynasties were often at odds with one another, vying for power and influence in a complex web of alliances and rivalries.\n\n## Succession\n\nThe succession of power within the House of Aberffraw was a complex and often contentious issue.

This line was descended from Rhodri ap Gruffydd, a powerful leader who played a key role in resisting the Norman invasion.\n\nThe Aberffraw senior line was characterized by a series of powerful leaders who exercised significant influence over the surrounding region. These leaders included Gruffydd ap Rhodri, who was a prominent figure in the early 12th century, and his son, Llywelyn the Great, who would go on to become one of the most famous leaders in Welsh history.\n\n**Llys**\n\nThe llys was a traditional Welsh court or meeting place that played a central role in the business of government and administration. The llys was often located in a prominent position, such as a hill or a fortified location, and was the seat of the local ruler or leader.\n\nDuring the medieval period, the llys was an important institution in Welsh society, serving as a focal point for the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the conduct of warfare. The llys was also an important center of learning and culture, where poets, musicians, and craftsmen would gather to share their skills and knowledge.\n\n## Rhosyr\n\nRhosyr was a medieval town located on the island of Anglesey, in the cantref of Aberffraw. The town was an important center of trade and commerce, with a thriving market and a busy port.\n\nRhosyr was also a significant cultural and educational center, with a number of important institutions, including a church and a scriptorium. The town was home to a number of prominent families, including the House of Aberffraw, which played a central role in the town's life and affairs.\n\n## Aberffraw\n\nAberffraw was the capital of the cantref of Aberffraw, and the seat of the House of Aberffraw.

The town was an important center of trade and commerce, with goods and commodities passing through its markets and ports.\n\n**Princes of Wales (de facto)**\n\nThe Princes of Wales were a series of leaders who exercised de facto power over Wales from the 13th to the 15th centuries. These leaders, who were often members of the House of Aberffraw, played a central role in the country's politics and society.\n\n## Llywelyn the Great\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a prominent leader of the House of Aberffraw who played a key role in shaping the course of Welsh history. He was a skilled military commander who resisted the Norman invasion of Wales and promoted the interests of the Welsh people.\n\nLlywelyn the Great was a powerful leader who exercised significant influence over the surrounding region. He was a skilled diplomat and strategist who played a key role in maintaining the independence of Wales and promoting the interests of the Welsh people.\n\n**1200s- 1400s**\n\nThe 13th to 15th centuries were a period of significant change and upheaval in Wales. The country was subject to a series of invasions and attacks, including the English invasion of 1277 and the Black Death of 1348.\n\nDuring this period, the House of Aberffraw continued to play a central role in Welsh politics and society. The dynasty's leaders, including Llywelyn ap Gruffydd and Owain Glyndŵr, played a key role in resisting the English invasion and promoting the interests of the Welsh people.\n\n**Succession after the dynasty**\n\nThe succession of power within the House of Aberffraw was a complex and often contentious issue. The dynasty was ruled by a system of primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited the throne. However, this system was not always followed, and power was often transferred to younger sons or other family members through a process of negotiation and compromise.\n\nAfter the decline of the House of Aberffraw, the throne of Wales was passed to the House of Tudor, which ruled the country from 1485 to 1603.

The controversy began in 2021 and continued into 2022, with several investigations and reactions from within the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and other stakeholders.\n\n**Background**\n\n**COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom, starting in March 2020. The government introduced various measures to control the spread of the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, and the closure of non-essential businesses. The lockdowns were enforced through a series of stages, with the most severe restrictions in place during the first and third lockdowns.\n\n**Westminster**\n\nThe UK Parliament's Westminster Palace was also subject to lockdown restrictions, with the Prime Minister's Office and other government departments operating remotely. However, it was alleged that some government officials and politicians continued to hold social gatherings and parties, despite the restrictions.\n\n**Timeline of reporting and reaction**\n\n**2021**\n\n**Up to 6 December**\n\nDuring the first national lockdown, it was alleged that Boris Johnson's then-press secretary, Allegra Stratton, had held a mock press conference in the Prime Minister's Office to practice for the real thing.

The investigation was seen as a test of the police's independence and impartiality.\n\n**Privileges Committee investigation**\n\nIn January 2022, the Privileges Committee announced that it would be investigating the events. The committee was tasked with determining whether the Prime Minister had deliberately misled Parliament about the parties.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n**Within the Conservative Party**\n\n**Initial responses**\n\nIn the initial stages of the scandal, several Conservative MPs came to Boris Johnson's defense, claiming that he had not deliberately misled Parliament about the parties. However, as the scandal continued to unfold, several MPs began to distance themselves from the Prime Minister.\n\n**Alleged intimidation of MPs opposed to Johnson**\n\nIn the summer of 2022, it was reported that several Conservative MPs who opposed Boris Johnson were being intimidated by the party's leadership. The allegations were made in the wake of a confidence vote, which saw the Prime Minister's leadership challenged.\n\n**After the Sue Gray update**\n\nAfter Sue Gray's report was published, several Conservative MPs called for Boris Johnson's resignation. The report's findings were seen as a significant blow to the Prime Minister's leadership, and several MPs began to call for him to step down.\n\n**Confidence vote**\n\nIn June 2022, Conservative MPs held a confidence vote, which saw the Prime Minister's leadership challenged.

Born on October 30, 1892, in Indianola, Mississippi, Malone's life was marked by a deep passion for history, teaching, and writing. His contributions to the field of American history have had a lasting impact, and his legacy continues to inspire scholars and historians to this day.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\n### Upbringing\n\nMalone was born to Willoughby Gibbs Malone and Isabella Dumas Malone, a family of modest means. His early life was shaped by the rural South, where his family lived on a small farm. Despite financial constraints, Malone's parents valued education, and he was encouraged to read and learn from an early age. This foundation would serve him well in his future academic pursuits.\n\n### Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone's initial intention was to become a minister, and he attended the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. However, he soon discovered a deeper interest in history and literature, which led him to transfer to Yale University. At Yale, Malone was heavily influenced by the academic rigor and intellectual curiosity of his professors, particularly the historian and educator, Thomas Day Thayer. Malone's time at Yale laid the groundwork for his future academic career, as he developed a passion for historical research and writing.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Virginia and the DAB\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Malone moved to Virginia, where he became involved in the publication of the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB). This ambitious project, which aimed to provide comprehensive biographies of notable Americans, would become a defining aspect of Malone's career. As an editor and contributor, Malone worked tirelessly to ensure the accuracy and quality of the biographies, which were eventually published between 1928 and 1944.\n\n### Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1942, Malone accepted a position at Harvard University Press, where he served as the managing editor for several years. During this period, he continued to work on the DAB, as well as other editorial projects. Malone's experience at Harvard University Press deepened his understanding of the publishing industry and further honed his skills as an editor and writer.\n\n### Return to Virginia\n\nAfter leaving Harvard University Press, Malone returned to Virginia, where he continued to work on his magnum opus, the six-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson. This monumental work, which took over two decades to complete, cemented Malone's reputation as a leading American historian. The biography, which covers Jefferson's life from 1743 to 1826, is considered a masterpiece of historical writing, offering a nuanced and comprehensive portrait of one of America's most complex and fascinating figures.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nMalone's contributions to American history have been recognized through numerous awards and honors. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948 and was awarded the National Book Award in 1974 for his biography of Jefferson. Malone was also awarded several honorary degrees from universities across the United States, including Yale, Harvard, and the University of Virginia.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nMalone married his wife, Elizabeth, in 1923, and they had two children together. The couple shared a deep love of history and literature, and their home in Virginia became a hub for intellectual and cultural activity. Malone passed away on August 27, 1986, at the age of 93, leaving behind a legacy of outstanding historical scholarship and a profound impact on the field of American history.\n\n**Selected Publications**\n\n### Jefferson and His Time\n\nMalone's magnum opus, the six-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, is considered a definitive work on the subject. Published between 1948 and 1981, the biography offers a comprehensive and nuanced portrait of Jefferson's life, from his early years to his later years as President. The work is based on extensive research and draws on a wide range of sources, including Jefferson's own writings and correspondence.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\n### Scholarly Sources\n\n#### Books\n\n* Malone, Dumas.

Turner's early life was marked by hardship and struggle, but her parents encouraged her to pursue her passion for music from a young age.\n\n**Ike and Tina Turner**\n\nTurner's music career began in the mid-1950s when she met Ike Turner, a successful musician and bandleader. Ike, born Izear Luster Turner, was a blues singer and guitarist who had formed his own band in 1951. Turner was initially hired as a backing vocalist for Ike's band, but her talent and charisma soon led to her becoming a lead singer.\n\n### **Origins: 1956–1960**\n\nTurner and Ike married in 1962, but their relationship was tumultuous from the start. Ike was a controlling and abusive partner, and Turner suffered physical and emotional abuse throughout their marriage. Despite this, Turner continued to perform with Ike's band, which eventually became known as the Ikettes. The group's music was a unique blend of blues, R&B, and rock, and they gained a significant following in the Southern United States.\n\n### **Early Success: 1960–1965**\n\nThe Ikettes' big break came in 1960 when they signed with Sue Records. Their first single, \"A Fool in Love,\" was a massive success, reaching the top of the Billboard R&B charts. This was followed by a string of hits, including \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" and \"Poor Fool.\" Turner's powerful voice and energetic stage presence made her a standout performer, and she quickly became known as the \"Queen of Rock 'n' Roll.\"\n\n### **Mainstream Success: 1966–1975**\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Ikettes' music became more polished and commercial, as they began to appeal to a wider audience. Their 1966 single \"River Deep – Mountain High\" was a huge success, reaching the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's success was short-lived, however, as Ike's abuse of Turner became increasingly public. The couple's marriage imploded, and Turner left Ike in 1976.\n\n### **Split: 1976**\n\nTurner's split from Ike marked a significant turning point in her career. She began to focus on her solo work, and her music became more introspective and personal. Her 1976 album \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" was a critical and commercial success, and it marked the beginning of her transition from a rock-oriented artist to a more soulful and introspective one.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\nTurner's solo career has been marked by numerous successes and accolades. Her music has become increasingly diverse, incorporating elements of soul, blues, and pop.\n\n### **Early Solo Career: 1976–1982**\n\nTurner's early solo career was marked by experimentation and exploration. Her 1976 album \"Tina Turns the Country On!\" was a country-infused album that showed Turner's versatility as an artist. Her 1978 album \"Rough\" was a harder-rocking album that showcased Turner's raw energy and power. The album was a commercial success, and it established Turner as a major solo artist.\n\n### **Career Resurgence and Superstardom: 1983–2000**\n\nThe 1980s marked a significant resurgence in Turner's career. Her 1984 album \"Private Dancer\" was a massive commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide. The album spawned several hit singles, including \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" and \"Better Be Good to Me.\" Turner's live performances during this period were also highly acclaimed, showcasing her energy and charisma.\n\n### **Later Career: 2001–2021**\n\nIn the 2000s, Turner continued to tour and record music. Her 2004 album \"All the Best\" was a greatest-hits collection that showcased her enduring popularity. Turner's live performances during this period were marked by her signature stage presence and energy.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nTurner's personal life has been marked by numerous relationships and marriages.\n\n### **Relationships and Marriages**\n\n#### **Early Relationships**\n\nTurner's early relationships were marked by her marriage to Ike Turner, which was tumultuous and abusive. She later married Erwin Bach, a German music executive, in 2013.\n\n#### **Ike Turner**\n\nTurner's marriage to Ike was marked by physical and emotional abuse. The couple's relationship was highly publicized, and Turner's struggles with Ike's behavior were well-documented.\n\n#### **Erwin Bach**\n\nTurner's marriage to Bach was a more stable and loving relationship. The couple met in the 1980s, and they began dating in the 1990s. They married in 2013 and have been together ever since.\n\n### **Children**\n\nTurner does not have any children of her own, but she has been a mother figure to many young women and men throughout her career.\n\n### **Religious Beliefs**\n\nTurner is a devout Christian and has spoken publicly about the importance of her faith in her life.\n\n### **Residences, Citizenship, and Wealth**\n\nTurner has lived in various locations throughout her career, including the United States and Switzerland. She is a citizen of both countries and has a significant net worth, estimated to be over $300 million.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nTurner has been open about her struggles with health issues, including a 2013 diagnosis of intestinal cancer. She underwent surgery and has since made a full recovery.\n\n**Musical Legacy and Accolades**\n\nTurner's musical legacy is immeasurable. She has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Grammy Hall of Fame. She has won numerous awards, including eight Grammy Awards, and has been named one of the greatest singers of all time by Rolling Stone.\n\n### **Awards, Honors and Achievements**\n\n* Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1991)\n* Inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (2000)\n* Inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame (2000)\n* Won eight Grammy Awards\n* Named one of the greatest singers of all time by Rolling Stone (2008)\n* Received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (1986)\n* Received a knighthood from the Order of the British Empire (2014)\n\n**Discography**\n\n### **Studio Albums**\n\n* _Tina Turns the Country On!_ (1974)\n* _Rough_ (1978)\n* _Love Explosion_ (1979)\n* _Private Dancer_ (1984)\n* _Break Every Rule_ (1986)\n* _Foreign Affair_ (1989)\n* _Wildest Dreams_ (1996)\n* _Twenty Four Seven_ (1999)\n* _All the Best_ (2004)\n* _Tina!_ (2008)\n* _Love Train_ (2021)\n\n**Tours**\n\n### **As Opening Act**\n\n* Supported Ike Turner on numerous tours throughout the 1960s\n* Supported The Rolling Stones on tour in 1989\n* Supported The Eagles on tour in 1999\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _The Wrecking Crew_ (1969)\n* _Tommy_ (1975)\n* _The Muppets Take Manhattan_ (1984)\n* _Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome_ (1985)\n* _What's Love Got to Do with It_ (1993)\n* _Last Action Hero_ (1993)\n* _Mad Dog Time_ (1996)\n* _I Spy_ (2002)\n* _Beauty Shop_ (2005)\n\n**Books**\n\n* _I, Tina: My Life Story_ (1986)\n* _Tina Turner: My Love Story_ (2018)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Turner's music career has spanned over five decades, making her one of the longest-lived and most successful musicians of all time.\n* Turner's live performances are renowned for their energy and charisma, and she has been named one of the greatest live performers of all time.\n* Turner has been inducted into numerous music halls of fame, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bibliography: _Tina Turner: The Musical Biography_ by David Dalton (2007)\n* Bibliography: _Tina Turner: My Love Story_ by Tina Turner (2018)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tina_Turner\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Ike and Tina Turner\n##Origins: 1956–1960\n##Early success: 1960–1965\n##Mainstream success: 1966–1975\n##Split: 1976\n#Solo career\n##Early solo career: 1976–1982\n##Career resurgence and superstardom: 1983–2000\n##Later career: 2001–2021\n#Personal life\n##Relationships and marriages\n###Early relationships\n###Ike Turner\n###Erwin Bach\n##Children\n##Religious beliefs\n##Residences, citizenship, and wealth\n#Illness and death\n#Musical legacy and accolades\n##Awards, honors and achievements\n#Discography\n##Studio albums\n#Tours\n##As opening act\n#Filmography\n#Books\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This movement seeks to reclaim and preserve the principles of the Protestant Reformation, emphasizing the authority of Scripture, the importance of doctrine, and the necessity of evangelism. Reformed fundamentalism is characterized by its commitment to a strict interpretation of the Bible, particularly in regards to the doctrine of inspiration and the authority of the Scriptures.\n\n#History and main leaders\n\nReformed fundamentalism has its roots in the early 20th century, when a group of Presbyterian and Reformed theologians sought to counter the growing influence of liberal theology within their denominations. One of the key leaders of this movement was J. Gresham Machen, a Presbyterian theologian and pastor who was a strong advocate for the authority of Scripture and the importance of doctrine. Machen's book, \"Christianity and Liberalism,\" published in 1923, is considered a seminal work in the development of Reformed fundamentalism.\n\nOther key leaders of the Reformed fundamentalist movement include Carl McIntire, a Presbyterian theologian and pastor who founded the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC) in 1941; and Cornelius Van Til, a Dutch-American theologian and pastor who is known for his work on presuppositional apologetics. Van Til's book, \"The Defense of the Faith,\" published in 1955, is considered a classic work in the field of apologetics and is still widely read and studied today.\n\n#Theological distinctives\n\nReformed fundamentalism is characterized by several distinctives that set it apart from other theological traditions.\n\n##Broader conservative evangelicalism\n\nWhile Reformed fundamentalism shares many similarities with broader conservative evangelicalism, there are also some key differences. One of the main differences is in regards to the doctrine of salvation and the gospel. Conservative evangelicals tend to emphasize the importance of personal conversion and the decision to accept Jesus Christ as one's personal savior. In contrast, Reformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of the objective nature of salvation, emphasizing that salvation is a gift of God that is received through faith alone.\n\n###Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of the gospel as a message of objective truth, rather than as a subjective experience. This approach is often referred to as \"gospel orthodoxy\" and is characterized by a strong emphasis on the importance of doctrine and the authority of Scripture. In contrast, conservative evangelicals tend to emphasize the importance of personal experience and the decision to accept Jesus Christ as one's personal savior.\n\n###Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n\nReformed fundamentalists also tend to emphasize the importance of other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology, such as the doctrine of the Trinity, the importance of church government, and the authority of Scripture. These emphases are often seen as essential to a proper understanding of the Christian faith and are frequently emphasized in Reformed fundamentalist theology.\n\n##The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of the inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures, particularly in regards to the doctrine of verbal plenary inspiration.\n\n###Verbal plenary inspiration\n\nVerbal plenary inspiration is the doctrine that the Bible is fully and completely inspired by God, and that every word and phrase of Scripture is the exact and infallible word of God. This doctrine is often seen as essential to a proper understanding of the authority and reliability of Scripture.\n\n###Preservation of the texts of scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists also tend to emphasize the importance of the preservation of the texts of Scripture, particularly in regards to the doctrine of the Byzantine Received Text. The Byzantine Received Text is a textual tradition that emphasizes the importance of the original Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, and is seen by many Reformed fundamentalists as the most reliable and authoritative text of Scripture.\n\n##Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading of Scripture. This approach is often referred to as \"evangelical hermeneutics\" and is characterized by a strong emphasis on the importance of understanding Scripture in its historical and cultural context, and of rejecting any interpretations that are seen as inconsistent with the plain meaning of Scripture.\n\n##The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n\nReformed fundamentalists also tend to emphasize the importance of the classical creeds and reformational confessions, such as the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Heidelberg Catechism. These documents are seen as essential to a proper understanding of the Christian faith and are frequently emphasized in Reformed fundamentalist theology.\n\n#Congregational practices\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of congregational practices that are consistent with their theological distinctives. These practices often include a strong emphasis on the importance of doctrine, the authority of Scripture, and the importance of evangelism.\n\n#Bible translation and usage\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of Bible translation and usage that is consistent with their theological distinctives. This often includes a strong emphasis on the importance of the Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions.\n\n##The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of the Authorised Version Tradition, which emphasizes the importance of the original language of Scripture and the importance of translating Scripture in a way that is consistent with the original language. This tradition is often seen as essential to a proper understanding of the authority and reliability of Scripture.\n\n##Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n\nReformed fundamentalists also tend to emphasize the importance of modern versions of the Bible, such as the New King James Version and the English Standard Version, which are seen as more accurate and reliable than earlier translations. However, there are also controversies surrounding the translation of Scripture, particularly in regards to the use of dynamic equivalence rather than formal equivalence.\n\n#Evangelical and missional apologetics\n\nReformed fundamentalists tend to emphasize the importance of evangelical and missional apologetics, which is seen as essential to a proper understanding of the Christian faith and the importance of evangelism.\n\n##Bible apologetics\n\nBible apologetics is a key aspect of evangelical and missional apologetics, and is seen as essential to a proper understanding of the authority and reliability of Scripture. This approach is often referred to as \"presuppositional apologetics\" and is characterized by a strong emphasis on the importance of understanding Scripture in its historical and cultural context.\n\n#Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n\nReformed fundamentalists have long been challenged by liberal-modernist theologians who question the doctrine of verbal inspiration and the truthfulness of Scripture. This challenge is often seen as a threat to the authority and reliability of Scripture, and is frequently emphasized in Reformed fundamentalist theology.\n\n#Modern biblical criticism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also been challenged by modern biblical criticism, which emphasizes the importance of historical and cultural context in understanding Scripture. While Reformed fundamentalists acknowledge the importance of historical and cultural context, they also emphasize the importance of understanding Scripture in light of its theological and biblical context.\n\n#Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n\nReformed fundamentalists have long been concerned about the impact of modern Western society and intellectual unbelief on the Christian faith. This concern is often seen as a threat to the authority and reliability of Scripture, and is frequently emphasized in Reformed fundamentalist theology.\n\n##Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also been critical of New-Neo Evangelicalism, which they see as a departure from the principles of the Protestant Reformation. This criticism is often seen as a threat to the authority and reliability of Scripture, and is frequently emphasized in Reformed fundamentalist theology.\n\n##Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n\nReformed fundamentalists have also been concerned about the impact of materialist and naturalist unbelief on the Christian faith. This concern is often seen as a threat to the authority and reliability of Scripture, and is frequently emphasized in Reformed fundamentalist theology.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reformed_fundamentalism\" following this outline:\n\n#History and main leaders\n#Theological distinctives\n##Broader conservative evangelicalism\n###Pertaining to salvation and the gospel\n###Other fundamental Protestant and biblical theology\n##The inspiration and preservation of the Scriptures\n###Verbal plenary inspiration\n###Preservation of the texts of scripture\n##Common principles of Reformation evangelical interpretation and private reading\n##The classical creeds and reformational confessions\n#Congregational practices\n#Bible translation and usage\n##The Authorised Version Tradition, the Byzantine Received Text, and Eastern (Greek) and Western (Greco-Latin) Ecclesiastical Translation Traditions\n##Modern versions, denominational preferences and translation controversies\n#Evangelical and missional apologetics\n##Bible apologetics\n#Liberal-modernist challenge to verbal inspiration and truthfulness of scripture\n#Modern biblical criticism\n#Modern Western society and intellectual unbelief\n##Criticism of New-Neo Evangelicalism and the 'Present Downgrade'\n##Materialist and naturalist unbelief, and historic Adamism and creationism\n#See also\n#Resources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is bordered by Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest, Georgia to the northeast, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east, Iraq and Syria to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the southwest. Turkey is a country of rich history, diverse culture, and stunning natural beauty.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Turkey\" is derived from the Middle English word \"Turke,\" which referred to the Turkic peoples who originated from Central Asia. The name \"Türkiye\" is the Turkish form of the country's name, which was adopted in 1923 after the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistory and ancient history\n\nThe earliest human habitation in Turkey dates back to the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing that humans lived in the region as far back as 500,000 years ago. The region was also home to several ancient civilizations, including the Hittites, who established a powerful empire in central Anatolia around 1600 BCE. The Hittites were known for their advanced technology and military prowess, and their empire eventually fell to the Phrygians, who established a kingdom in western Anatolia.\n\n### Early classical antiquity\n\nIn the 7th century BCE, the Ionian Greeks established colonies in western Anatolia, which became a major center of Greek culture and learning. The ancient city of Ephesus, located in modern-day İzmir Province, was a major center of trade and commerce in the ancient world. The city of Pergamon, located in modern-day Bergama Province, was also an important center of culture and learning, and was home to the famous Library of Pergamon, which was one of the largest libraries in the ancient world.\n\n### Rome and Byzantine Empire\n\nIn 133 BCE, the Romans conquered the Hellenistic kingdoms of Asia Minor, and the region became a major province of the Roman Empire. The Romans built several roads, bridges, and public buildings in the region, and the city of Ephesus became a major center of early Christianity. In the 4th century CE, the Roman Empire was divided into two parts, with the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, ruling from Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul). The Byzantine Empire was a major center of Christianity, and the city of Constantinople was one of the most important cities in the world.\n\n### Seljuks and Anatolian beyliks\n\nIn the 11th century CE, the Seljuk Turks, a nomadic people from Central Asia, began to migrate to Anatolia, which was then under Byzantine rule. The Seljuks eventually established a powerful empire in central Anatolia, and the region became a major center of Turkish culture and learning. The Seljuks were also known for their advanced technology and military prowess, and their empire eventually fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 14th century CE.\n\n### Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was one of the largest and most powerful empires in history, and it ruled over a vast territory that stretched from Eastern Europe to Western Asia. The Ottomans were known for their advanced technology, architecture, and military prowess, and their empire became a major center of culture and learning. The Ottomans also played a major role in the development of the Turkish language and literature, and their empire was a major center of Islamic culture.\n\n### Republic of Türkiye\n\nIn 1923, the Ottoman Empire was dissolved, and the modern Republic of Turkey was established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who became the first president of the country. Atatürk implemented a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the country and secularizing its society, and the Republic of Turkey has since become a major democracy and economic power in the world.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nTurkey is divided into 81 provinces, which are further divided into districts and municipalities. The provinces are:\n\n1. Adıyaman\n2. Afyonkarahisar\n3. Ağrı\n4. Aksaray\n5. Amasya\n6. Ankara\n7. Antalya\n8. Ardahan\n9. Artvin\n10. Aydın\n11. Balıkesir\n12. Bartın\n13. Batman\n14. Bayburt\n15.

He is best known for his philosophical ideas on the nature of reality, change, and the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n**Life**\n\nLittle is known about Heraclitus' life, and most of what is known comes from later sources, particularly the accounts of him by the ancient Greek historians Diogenes Laertius and Plato. From these accounts, it is believed that Heraclitus was born around 535 BCE into a noble family in Ephesus. His father was a noble and a priest of the cult of Helios (the Greek sun god), and Heraclitus was trained in the traditional Greek culture and education of his time.\n\n**On Nature**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered on his observations of the natural world. He believed that the world is in a constant state of change and flux, and that all things are interconnected. He saw the world as a complex system of opposites, where everything is simultaneously contradictory and complementary.\n\n### Structure\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is structured around his idea that the world is a systematic whole, with everything connected and interdependent. He saw the natural world as a vast, interconnected web, where every part is related to and influenced by every other part.\n\n### Style\n\nHeraclitus' writing style is characterized by its obscurity and paradoxical nature. He often used aphorisms and enigmatic statements to convey his ideas, which were meant to be thought-provoking and challenging to his readers.\n\n#### The Obscure\n\nHeraclitus' writing style has been described as \"obscure\" and \"enigmatic.\" He often used cryptic language and paradoxical statements to convey his ideas, which were meant to be thought-provoking and challenging to his readers. This style has been interpreted in many different ways by scholars over the centuries, and continues to be a subject of debate and discussion today.\n\n**Philosophy**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy is centered on his ideas on the nature of reality, change, and the interconnectedness of all things. He believed that the world is in a constant state of flux, and that all things are interconnected and interdependent.\n\n### Unity of opposites and flux\n\nHeraclitus believed that the world is characterized by a fundamental unity of opposites, where everything is simultaneously contradictory and complementary. He saw the natural world as a vast, interconnected web, where every part is related to and influenced by every other part.\n\n#### Panta rhei\n\nHeraclitus' most famous statement, \"Panta rhei,\" or \"everything flows,\" captures his idea that the world is in a constant state of change and flux. He saw the world as a dynamic, ever-changing system, where everything is in a state of constant motion and transformation.\n\n#### You cannot step into the same river twice\n\nHeraclitus used the example of a river to illustrate his idea that everything is in a state of constant change and flux. He said that you cannot step into the same river twice, because the river is constantly changing and flowing, and the water is always different.\n\n#### Strife is justice\n\nHeraclitus believed that strife and conflict are necessary for the maintenance of justice and order in the world. He saw the natural world as a dynamic, ever-changing system, where everything is in a state of constant motion and transformation.\n\n### Logos\n\nHeraclitus believed that the natural world is governed by a fundamental principle or logos, which is the rational and orderly structure of the universe. He saw the world as a vast, interconnected web, where every part is related to and influenced by every other part.\n\n### Fire\n\nHeraclitus saw fire as a fundamental and universal principle, which is the source of all life and energy in the world. He believed that fire is a symbol of the logos, and that it is the driving force behind all change and transformation in the world.\n\n#### Fire as symbolic\n\nHeraclitus used fire as a symbol of the logos, and saw it as a universal principle that is present in all things. He believed that fire is the source of all life and energy in the world, and that it is the driving force behind all change and transformation.\n\n**Cosmology**\n\nHeraclitus' cosmology is centered on his ideas on the nature of the universe and the origin of all things. He believed that the universe is a vast, interconnected web, where every part is related to and influenced by every other part.\n\n### Sun\n\nHeraclitus saw the sun as a fundamental and universal principle, which is the source of all light and energy in the world. He believed that the sun is a symbol of the logos, and that it is the driving force behind all change and transformation in the world.\n\n### Moon\n\nHeraclitus saw the moon as a symbol of the eternal and unchanging, and believed that it is a reflection of the divine and the infinite. He saw the moon as a symbol of the cyclical nature of time, and believed that it is a reminder of the eternal and unchanging nature of the universe.\n\n**God**\n\nHeraclitus believed that the universe is governed by a supreme and eternal being, which he called the \"common mind\" or the \"one.\" He saw God as a universal principle, which is the source of all life and energy in the world.\n\n**The Soul**\n\nHeraclitus believed that the soul is a divine and eternal principle, which is the source of all consciousness and awareness in the world. He saw the soul as a spark of the divine, and believed that it is the driving force behind all change and transformation in the world.\n\n**Foreign influence**\n\nHeraclitus' philosophy was influenced by his encounters with other cultures and civilizations. He was familiar with the ideas of the Persians, Indians, and Egyptians, and saw their philosophies as complementary to his own ideas.\n\n### Persia\n\nHeraclitus was familiar with the ideas of the Persians, and saw their philosophy as a reflection of the universal principles that govern the world.

The compound, a complex organometallic molecule, has been the subject of numerous studies and research papers. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LK-99, its synthesis, physical properties, and proposed mechanism for superconductivity.\n\n#Chemical properties and structure\n\n##Synthesis\n\nLK-99 was first synthesized in 2010 by a research team led by Dr. Leonid K. (the \"LK\" in LK-99) at a prestigious university in the United States. The team used a combination of high-pressure and high-temperature techniques to create the compound. The exact synthesis procedure has been kept under wraps, but it is believed to involve the reaction of a rare earth metal with a specific organic ligand.\n\n##Structure\n\nThe molecular structure of LK-99 is highly complex, consisting of a central rare earth metal atom bonded to a series of organic ligands. The exact arrangement of these ligands is still not well understood, but it is thought to play a crucial role in the compound's superconducting properties. The structure of LK-99 has been the subject of extensive study, with researchers using a range of techniques including X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\n\n##Theoretical models\n\nSeveral theoretical models have been proposed to explain the structure of LK-99, including the \"dimer model\" and the \"polymer model\". The dimer model suggests that LK-99 consists of a series of dimers, with each dimer being composed of two rare earth metal atoms bonded to a single ligand. The polymer model, on the other hand, proposes that LK-99 is a polymeric material, with the rare earth metal atoms bonded to a long chain of ligands.\n\n#Physical properties\n\n##Superconductivity\n\nOne of the most fascinating properties of LK-99 is its potential for superconductivity. Superconductivity is the ability of a material to conduct electricity with zero resistance, and it is a highly sought-after property in materials science. LK-99 has been shown to exhibit superconducting behavior at relatively high temperatures, making it a promising candidate for a range of applications.\n\n##Proposed mechanism for superconductivity\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the superconductivity of LK-99, including the \"phonon-mediated\" mechanism and the \"electronic\" mechanism. The phonon-mediated mechanism proposes that the superconductivity is due to the interaction between the rare earth metal atoms and the lattice vibrations of the material. The electronic mechanism, on the other hand, suggests that the superconductivity is due to the interaction between the electrons in the material.\n\n##Response to heat and pressure\n\nLK-99 has been shown to be highly sensitive to heat and pressure, with its superconducting properties being affected by even small changes in temperature and pressure. This sensitivity has led to concerns about the stability of the material, and researchers have been working to develop techniques to improve its thermal and mechanical stability.\n\n#Compound name\n\nThe name \"LK-99\" is derived from the initials of the researcher who first synthesized the compound, Dr. Leonid K. The number \"99\" likely refers to the date of the discovery of the compound, although this is not explicitly stated.\n\n#Publication history\n\n##Scholarly articles and preprints\n\nLK-99 has been the subject of numerous scholarly articles and preprints, with many of these papers being published in high-impact journals. Some of the most notable papers include a 2012 article published in the journal Nature, which reported the discovery of the compound and its superconducting properties.\n\n##Other discussion by authors\n\nSeveral authors have discussed LK-99 in the context of other research areas, including materials science and condensed matter physics. One author has suggested that LK-99 may have potential applications in the field of quantum computing, while another has proposed that the compound could be used to study the behavior of strongly correlated electrons.\n\n#Response\n\n##Public response\n\nThe discovery of LK-99 has generated significant public interest, with many scientists and journalists hailing it as a major breakthrough. The compound has been featured in several media outlets, including newspapers, magazines, and online news sites.\n\n##Scientific response\n\nThe scientific community has responded to the discovery of LK-99 with a mix of excitement and skepticism. Some researchers have hailed the compound as a major breakthrough, while others have questioned its stability and potential applications. Several researchers have proposed alternative explanations for the compound's superconducting properties, and there is ongoing debate about the best way to replicate and study the compound.\n\n#Replication attempts\n\n##Experimental studies\n\nSeveral researchers have attempted to replicate the synthesis of LK-99, but with limited success. One team was able to produce a similar compound, but with different properties. Another team was unable to replicate the synthesis at all.\n\n##Theoretical studies\n\nSeveral theoretical studies have been conducted to better understand the properties of LK-99 and its potential applications. One study suggested that the compound could be used to study the behavior of strongly correlated electrons, while another proposed that it could be used to develop new materials with unique properties.\n\n#See also\n\n* Superconductivity\n* Rare earth metals\n* Organic ligands\n* Quantum computing\n* Condensed matter physics\n\n#References\n\n(This section has been intentionally left blank)\n\n#Further reading\n\nFor further information on LK-99, see the following sources:\n\n* A 2012 article published in the journal Nature, which reported the discovery of the compound and its superconducting properties.\n* A 2013 article published in the journal Physical Review Letters, which proposed a theoretical model for the structure of LK-99.\n* A 2014 article published in the journal Science, which discussed the potential applications of LK-99 in the field of quantum computing.\n\n#External links\n\n* A webpage dedicated to LK-99, hosted by the university where the compound was first synthesized.\n* A video presentation on LK-99, given by one of the researchers involved in its discovery.\n* A news article on LK-99, published in a major online news site.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"LK-99\" following this outline:\n\n#Chemical properties and structure\n##Synthesis\n#Physical properties\n##Proposed mechanism for superconductivity\n###Response\n#Compound name\n#Publication history\n##Scholarly articles and preprints\n###Other discussion by authors\n#Response\n##Public response\n#Replication attempts\n##Experimental studies\n##Theoretical studies\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The group is known for its complex dynamics, intense rivalries, and numerous championship reigns. The Bloodline is considered one of the most successful stables in WWE history.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Bloodline's roots date back to the early 2010s when Jimmy and Jey Uso, a Samoan-American wrestling duo, began competing in WWE. The Usos' early success was marked by their high-flying moves and charismatic personalities. As they rose through the ranks, they became one of the most dominant tag teams in WWE.\n\n**History**\n\n#### **The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)**\n\nIn 2013, The Shield, a dominant faction consisting of Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins, emerged in WWE. The Usos quickly found themselves at odds with The Shield, engaging in a series of intense matches and feuds. The rivalry between the two factions helped establish The Usos as top contenders in WWE.\n\n#### **Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)**\n\nAs The Shield disbanded in 2014, The Usos continued to compete individually and occasionally team up. They formed a temporary alliance with other wrestlers, including Big E and Kofi Kingston, to take on common enemies. Despite these team-ups, The Usos remained a dominant force in WWE, consistently challenging for championships.\n\n#### **Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)**\n\nIn 2020, The Bloodline officially formed around Roman Reigns, who became the group's leader. Reigns, a Samoan wrestling legend, had already established himself as a top WWE star. The Bloodline's formation marked a significant shift in WWE's landscape, as Reigns brought a new level of intensity and charisma to the group.\n\n#### **Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)**\n\nThe Bloodline's early days were marked by a series of dominant victories, as Reigns and The Usos consistently defeated top WWE talent. The group's popularity grew, and they became one of the most dominant factions in WWE.\n\n#### **All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)**\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline achieved a historic feat by becoming the first WWE faction to have all members hold championships simultaneously. The group's victory parade was short-lived, as they soon found themselves embroiled in a heated rivalry with The New Day. The intense feud between the two factions pushed WWE storytelling to new heights.\n\n#### **Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)**\n\nIn 2022, The Bloodline welcomed two new members: Sami Zayn, a Canadian wrestler, and Solo Sikoa, the brother of The Usos. The additions brought a new dynamic to the group, as Zayn's complexity and Sikoa's charisma added depth to The Bloodline's already intricate storyline.\n\n#### **Bloodline Civil War (2023)**\n\nAs The Bloodline continued to dominate WWE, internal conflicts began to simmer. The Usos, Zayn, and Sikoa found themselves at odds with Reigns, leading to a brutal and intense Bloodline Civil War. The conflict threatened to dismantle the group, but ultimately, they emerged stronger than ever.\n\n#### **Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)**\n\nIn 2023, The Bloodline welcomed a new member: Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, a Hollywood superstar and WWE legend. The Rock's arrival marked a new era for The Bloodline, as they took on Cody Rhodes, a rising WWE star, in a series of epic matches.\n\n#### **Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)**\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa took over as the leader of The Bloodline, marking a new chapter in the group's history. Sikoa's leadership has brought a new level of intensity and unpredictability to The Bloodline, as they continue to dominate WWE.\n\n#### **Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)**\n\nIn 2024, The Bloodline welcomed two new members: The Tongans, a Samoan wrestling family, and Jacob Fatu, a wrestler from the Fatu family. The additions have brought a new level of excitement and energy to The Bloodline, as they continue to push the boundaries of WWE storytelling.\n\n#### **Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)**\n\nThe Bloodline's latest chapter is marked by a new Bloodline Civil War, as internal conflicts threaten to dismantle the group once again. The Usos, Zayn, and Sikoa are at odds with Reigns, and the group's future is uncertain. Will The Bloodline emerge stronger than ever, or will they succumb to their internal conflicts?\n\n**Members**\n\n### **Current**\n\n* Roman Reigns\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Tongans (notable members include Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa)\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### **Former**\n\n* The Rock (joined the group in 2023, but has since left)\n* Big E (briefly joined the group in 2021)\n* Kofi Kingston (briefly joined the group in 2021)\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* 2013: The Usos begin competing in WWE.\n* 2014: The Shield forms and dominates WWE.\n* 2020: The Bloodline officially forms around Roman Reigns.\n* 2020–2021: The Bloodline becomes one of the most dominant factions in WWE.\n* 2021: The Bloodline becomes the first WWE faction to have all members hold championships simultaneously.\n* 2021–2022: The Bloodline is involved in a heated rivalry with The New Day.\n* 2022: Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa join The Bloodline.\n* 2023: The Bloodline is embroiled in a brutal and intense Bloodline Civil War.\n* 2023: The Rock joins The Bloodline.\n* 2023–2024: The Bloodline takes on Cody Rhodes in a series of epic matches.\n* 2024: Solo Sikoa takes over as the leader of The Bloodline.\n* 2024: The Bloodline welcomes The Tongans and Jacob Fatu.\n* 2024–present: The Bloodline is embroiled in a new Bloodline Civil War.\n\n**Sub-groups**\n\n### **Current**\n\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* The Tongans (notable members include Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa)\n\n### **Former**\n\n* The New Day (briefly allied with The Bloodline in 2021)\n* The Shield (briefly allied with The Bloodline in 2020)\n\n**Championships and accomplishments**\n\n* Roman Reigns: WWE Universal Champion (x3), WWE Championship (x2)\n* The Usos: WWE Tag Team Championship (x4)\n* Sami Zayn: WWE Intercontinental Champion\n* Solo Sikoa: WWE Intercontinental Champion\n\n**Other media**\n\n* The Bloodline has been featured in various WWE television programming, including Monday Night Raw, SmackDown, and NXT.\n* The group has also been featured in WWE's digital media, including YouTube and social media platforms.\n\n**See also**\n\n* The Usos\n* Roman Reigns\n* Sami Zayn\n* Solo Sikoa\n* The Tongans\n* Jacob Fatu\n* The New Day\n* The Shield\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Bloodline's history and dynamics are complex and often contradictory.\n* The group's internal conflicts and rivalries have pushed WWE storytelling to new heights.\n* The Bloodline's popularity and influence continue to grow, making them one of the most dominant factions in WWE history.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided in this article, as per the requirements.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* WWE.com: The Bloodline\n* WWE.co.uk: The Bloodline\n* WWE FanNation: The Bloodline", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n##Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n##Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n###Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n###All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n###Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n###Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n###Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n##Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n###Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n###Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n#Members\n##Current\n##Former\n#Timeline\n#Sub-groups\n##Current\n##Former\n#Championships and accomplishments\n#Other media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident resulted in the loss of five lives and raised concerns about the safety of submersible vessels in extreme environments.\n\n**Background**\n\n### OceanGate\n\nOceanGate, a US-based company, was founded in 2009 with the goal of providing submersible services to the offshore energy and scientific communities. The company had previously operated submersibles in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Ocean, but the Titanic expedition was its most ambitious project to date.\n\n### Titanic\n\nThe RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship's wreckage was discovered in 1985 by a team led by Robert Ballard, and it has since become a popular destination for deep-sea expeditions.\n\n**Submersible Titan**\n\nThe Submersible Titan was a deep-sea submersible vessel designed and built by OceanGate for the purpose of exploring the Titanic wreck. The submersible was equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, communication equipment, and a high-definition camera system for capturing footage of the wreck.\n\n### Dives to wreck of Titanic\n\nThe Submersible Titan had conducted several successful dives to the Titanic wreck in the months leading up to the incident, with a total of 12 dives completed before the fatal expedition. The submersible was able to reach depths of up to 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) during these dives.\n\n### Safety\n\nOceanGate had implemented a range of safety protocols for the Titanic expedition, including regular maintenance of the submersible, thorough safety briefings for the passengers, and a comprehensive emergency response plan in case of an incident. However, some experts have questioned the effectiveness of these measures in extreme environments.\n\n### Prior concerns\n\nThere had been concerns raised about the safety of the Submersible Titan and the capabilities of OceanGate in the months leading up to the incident. Some experts had questioned the company's experience and expertise in deep-sea operations, and there were concerns about the submersible's ability to withstand the extreme pressure of the deep ocean.\n\n### Previous incidents\n\nThere had been several previous incidents involving submersibles in the years leading up to the Titan implosion, including a fatal accident in 2019 in which a submersible vessel sank off the coast of the Philippines, killing all five crew members on board.\n\n**Incident**\n\n### Expedition arrangements\n\nThe Titanic expedition was scheduled to depart from St. John's, Newfoundland, on June 16, 2023, with a planned dive to the wreck on June 18. The expedition was led by Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate, and included five passengers, all of whom were paying customers.\n\n### 16–17 June preparations\n\nThe day before the dive, the Submersible Titan was prepared for launch, with the crew conducting a series of safety checks and pre-flight preparations. The passengers were briefed on the safety protocols and emergency procedures, and the submersible was fueled with enough oxygen to last for several days.\n\n### 18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Submersible Titan descended into the depths of the North Atlantic Ocean, reaching the Titanic wreck at around 8:00 am local time. However, during the dive, contact was lost with the submersible, and it was later discovered that the vessel had imploded at a depth of around 12,500 feet (3,800 meters). The implosion was likely caused by a catastrophic failure of the submersible's pressure hull, which resulted in the loss of all five lives on board.\n\n### 18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched immediately after contact was lost with the submersible, with the US Coast Guard and Canadian authorities working together to locate the vessel. The search effort involved a range of assets, including ships, aircraft, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), but no signs of the submersible or its occupants were found during the initial search.\n\n### 22 June, discovery of debris\n\nOn June 22, 2023, a piece of debris was spotted by a search team in the vicinity of the Titanic wreck, and it was later confirmed to be a fragment of the Submersible Titan. The debris was found at a depth of around 12,500 feet (3,800 meters), and it was later recovered by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and brought to the surface.\n\n### Fatalities\n\nThe five passengers on board the Submersible Titan were all fatalities in the incident. They were:\n\n* Shahzada Dawood, a British businessman and philanthropist\n* Suleman Dawood, Shahzada's son\n* Hamish Harding, a British businessman and explorer\n* Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a French deep-sea explorer\n* Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate\n\n**Recovery operations**\n\nThe recovery operation for the Submersible Titan was led by the US Coast Guard and involved a range of assets, including ships, aircraft, and ROVs. The operation was complex and challenging, due to the extreme depth and conditions of the deep ocean.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nThe incident is currently under investigation by both the United States and Canadian authorities. The investigation is likely to involve a range of agencies, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the US Coast Guard, and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board (TSB).\n\n### United States\n\nThe NTSB is leading the investigation into the incident, and it is likely to involve a detailed examination of the submersible's design, operation, and maintenance. The investigation is also likely to examine the safety protocols and emergency procedures in place at the time of the incident.\n\n### Canada\n\nThe TSB is also involved in the investigation, and it is likely to focus on the Canadian aspects of the incident, including the submersible's operation and maintenance in Canadian waters.\n\n**Lawsuit**\n\nA lawsuit has been filed on behalf of the families of the victims, seeking damages for their loss. The lawsuit alleges that OceanGate was negligent in the design, operation, and maintenance of the submersible, and that it failed to provide adequate safety protocols and emergency procedures.\n\n**Financial costs of operations**\n\nThe financial costs of the incident are likely to be substantial, with estimates suggesting that the recovery operation alone may have cost tens of millions of dollars. The costs of the investigation and the lawsuit are also likely to be significant.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe incident has caused widespread shock and outrage, with many expressing their sympathy for the families of the victims. The incident has also raised questions about the safety of submersible vessels in extreme environments and the need for improved safety protocols and emergency procedures.\n\n**In social and mass media**\n\nThe incident has been widely reported in social and mass media, with many outlets providing detailed coverage of the incident and its aftermath. The incident has also been the subject of numerous news articles, opinion pieces, and social media posts.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Submersible vessel\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* OceanGate\n* Titanic wreck\n* NTSB\n* TSB\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the incident and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account.\n* The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and this article may be updated as new information becomes available.\n\n**References**\n\n* (None)\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate website\n* NTSB website\n* TSB website\n* US Coast Guard website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Titan_submersible_implosion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##OceanGate\n##Titanic\n#Submersible Titan\n##Dives to wreck of Titanic\n##Safety\n##Prior concerns\n##Previous incidents\n#Incident\n##Expedition arrangements\n##16–17 June preparations\n##18 June, dive, disappearance, and implosion\n##18–22 June, search and rescue efforts\n##22 June, discovery of debris\n##Fatalities\n#Recovery operations\n#Investigations\n##United States\n##Canada\n#Lawsuit\n#Financial costs of operations\n#Reactions\n#In social and mass media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
