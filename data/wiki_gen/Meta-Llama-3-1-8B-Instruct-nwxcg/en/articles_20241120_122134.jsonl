Ewing [47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career [48] [49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg [14]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers) One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center [56] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan [57] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history [58]\n\n\nChicago Bulls (1984–1993;

American professional sports history [58]\n\n\nPistons roadblock (1987–1990)\nJordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting, [46] and won his first league MVP Award He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg), [81] [c] and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league [83] The Bulls finished 50–32, [66] and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games [84] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, [65] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\" [85]\n\n\nFirst three-peat (1991–1993)\nAfter their previous loss to the Pistons, Phil Jackson, along with assistant coach Tex Winter, focused on implementing the triangle offense to counteract the Pistons' defense and other teams that heavily targeted Michael Jordan This system, however, required Jordan to adjust his playing style [92] In his book Eleven Rings, Jackson recalled, \"I was planning to ask Michael to reduce the number of shots he took so that other members of the team could get more involved in the offense I knew this would be a challenge for him.\" [93] In The Last Dance, Jordan admitted he was initially reluctant and even mocked the system as an \"equal opportunity offense\" [94] Nevertheless, he eventually embraced the change, which led to tremendous success for the team [95]\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season [46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season [66] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star,

New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks [111] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, [112] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course [113] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, [114] [115] but the rumor spread widely [116]\n\n\nFirst retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball He later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision [118] James R Jordan Sr was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus [119] [120] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3 [120] Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment [121] However, in The Last Dance, Jordan stated that he retired due to physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom [122]\n\n\nReturn to the NBA (1995)\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup [66] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs [137] In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike [138] During the 1994–95 season, Jordan returned to the Bulls midway through the season On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his comeback to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\" [139] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points [140] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975 [141] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No 45, his baseball number [140]\n\n\nSecond three-peat (1996–1998)\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season [147] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3 [148] The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors [149] Jordan led the league in scoring with

2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards [175] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed [176] [177] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland) [178] [179] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons [176] [180]\n\n\nWashington Wizards (2001–2003)\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks [185] [186] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg), [5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention; [187] [188] Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot [189] After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee, [190] and subsequent knee soreness, [191] the Wizards missed the playoffs, [192] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season [46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game [193] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement [192]\n\n\nFinal retirement (2003)\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation [200] The Miami Heat retired the No 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team [201] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; [202] he accepted the spot of Vince Carter [203] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56 Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans [204]\n\n\nNational team career\nJordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in

professional basketball with the Washington Wizards [14] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests [210] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic [211] [212] [213] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\" [3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization [214] Jordan's fierce competitiveness greatly impacted his teammates, sometimes motivating them but also leading to tension and alienation [215] [216]\n\n\nLegacy\nJordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving [60] [62] Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that Jordan was \"one of a kind\", and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete [232] In his first game in Madison Square Garden against

retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards [287] Jordan's previous tenure had produced mixed results

Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.\n\n**Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets**\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations. Despite his previous success as an endorser, Jordan made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.

They had three children: Jeffrey, Marcus, and Jasmine. The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably.\" It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.\n\n**Media Figure and Business Interests**\n\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history.

Methodist [34]\n\n\nCollege career\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage) [46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing [47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career [48] [49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg [14]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers) One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center [56] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan [57] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history [58]\n\n\nChicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers) One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams

and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers) One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center [56] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan [57] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history [58]\n\n\nPistons roadblock (1987–1990)\nJordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting, [46] and won his first league MVP Award He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg), [81] [c] and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league [83] The Bulls finished 50–32, [66] and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games [84] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, [65] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\" [85]\n\n\nFirst three-peat (1991–1993)\nAfter their previous loss to the Pistons, Phil Jackson, along with assistant coach Tex Winter, focused on implementing the triangle offense to counteract the Pistons' defense and other teams that heavily targeted Michael Jordan This system, however, required Jordan to adjust his playing style [92] In his book Eleven Rings, Jackson recalled, \"I was planning to ask Michael to reduce the number of shots he took so that other members of the team could get more involved in the offense I knew this would be a challenge for him.\" [93] In The Last Dance, Jordan admitted he was initially reluctant and even mocked the system as an \"equal opportunity offense\" [94] Nevertheless, he eventually embraced the change, which led to tremendous success for the team [95]\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season [46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season [66] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them; [96] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep [97]\n\n\nGambling\nDuring the 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks [111] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, [112] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course [113] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, [114] [115] but the rumor spread widely [116]\n\n\nFirst retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball He later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision [118] James R Jordan Sr was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus [119] [120] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3 [120] Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment [121] However, in The Last Dance, Jordan stated that he retired due to physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom [122]\n\n\nReturn to the NBA (1995)\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup [66] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs [137] In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike [138] During the 1994–95 season, Jordan returned to the Bulls midway through the season On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his comeback to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\" [139] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points [140] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975 [141] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No 45, his baseball number [140]\n\n\nSecond three-peat (1996–1998)\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season [147] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3 [148] The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors [149] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg, [150] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards [14]\n\n\nSecond retirement (1999–2001)\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999 [172] [173] [174] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards [175] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed [176] [177] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland) [178] [179] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons [176] [180]\n\n\nWashington Wizards (2001–2003)\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks [185] [186] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg), [5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention; [187] [188] Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot [189] After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee, [190] and subsequent knee soreness, [191] the Wizards missed the playoffs, [192] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season [46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game [193] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement [192]\n\n\nFinal retirement (2003)\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation [200] The Miami Heat retired the No 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team [201] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; [202] he accepted the spot of Vince Carter [203] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56 Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans [204]\n\n\nNational team career\nJordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal [205] [206] The following year, Jordan won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics The 1984 U.S team was coached by Bob Knight and featured young players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament [207]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards [14] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests [210] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic [211] [212] [213] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\" [3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization [214] Jordan's fierce competitiveness greatly impacted his teammates, sometimes motivating them but also leading to tension and alienation [215] [216]\n\n\nLegacy\nJordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving [60] [62] Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that Jordan was \"one of a kind\", and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete [232] In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near minute-long standing ovation [62] After Jordan established the single game playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as \"God

Born Olivia Osuna on April 17, 1951, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Hussey's early life and career have been marked by a passion for the performing arts and a dedication to her craft.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nHussey was born to Argentine opera singer Andrés Osuna (stage name Osvaldo Ribó) and Joy Hussey, a legal secretary from England. Her parents were Roman Catholics, and she was raised in that denomination. Hussey has spoken fondly of her childhood, recalling that her mother had a \"mini-altar\" at home with a candle that was always lit, and that her mother's love of God was instilled in her from a young age.\n\nWhen Hussey was two years old, her parents separated but never divorced. Despite this, Hussey has spoken highly of her father, who encouraged her love of music and the arts. She has also credited her mother with instilling in her a strong sense of faith and a love of learning.\n\nCareer\n---------\n\nHussey's early career in the performing arts began when she appeared in a West End production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, playing the role of Jenny opposite Vanessa Redgrave. It was during this production that Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli noticed her performance, and he went on to cast her as Juliet in his 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet.\n\nHussey's performance as Juliet won her a special David di Donatello Award and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actress in 1969. Her portrayal of the iconic character has been widely praised, and she remains closely associated with the role.\n\nBreakthrough with Romeo and Juliet\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe success of Romeo and Juliet catapulted Hussey to international stardom, and she became one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood. Her performance as Juliet was widely praised, and she was hailed as a talented young actress with a bright future ahead of her.\n\nHussey's breakthrough role in Romeo and Juliet marked the beginning of a long and successful career in film and television. She went on to appear in a wide range of productions, from drama and horror to musicals and comedy.\n\nNude Scene Controversy\n----------------------\n\nOne of the most infamous moments in Hussey's career was the filming of the nude scene in Romeo and Juliet. The scene, which was shot at the end of the film, has been the subject of much controversy over the years. In an interview with Fox News, Hussey spoke about the experience of filming the scene, saying that it was not a big deal at the time, and that she and her co-star, Leonard Whiting, were both aware of what they were doing.\n\nIn another interview with Variety, Hussey defended the nude scene, saying that it was necessary for the film, and that Zeffirelli shot it tastefully. She also noted that she and Whiting were both from drama schools, and that they took their work very seriously.\n\nSubsequent Screen Roles and Voice Work\n----------------------------------------\n\nAfter the success of Romeo and Juliet, Hussey went on to appear in a wide range of productions, including the British drama All the Right Noises, the musical Lost Horizon, and the Canadian horror film Black Christmas.\n\nIn 1977, Hussey appeared in the television production of Jesus of Nazareth, playing the role of Mary, the mother of Jesus. This was her second collaboration with director Franco Zeffirelli, and it marked a return to her roots in the performing arts.\n\nIn 1978, Hussey appeared in the film Death on the Nile, playing the role of Rosalie Otterbourne opposite Peter Ustinov. She also appeared in the 1979 film The Cat and the Canary, and in the 1980 Japanese film Virus.\n\nHussey has also had a successful career in voice work, providing voices for a number of animated films and television productions.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nHussey has been open about her struggles with agoraphobia, which was exacerbated by the fame she achieved after Romeo and Juliet. She has spoken about the challenges of dealing with the pressures of fame, and the importance of maintaining a sense of normalcy in her life.\n\nIn recent years, Hussey has been involved in a number of charitable endeavors, including working with children's charities and supporting causes related to mental health.\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n**Film**\n\n* Romeo and Juliet (1968)\n* All the Right Noises (1971)\n* The Summertime Killer (1972)\n* Lost Horizon (1973)\n* Black Christmas (1974)\n* Jesus of Nazareth (1977)\n* Death on the Nile (1978)\n* The Cat and the Canary (1979)\n* Virus (1980)\n* Ivanhoe (1982)\n* Turkey Shoot (1982)\n\n**Television**\n\n* The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1968)\n* Jesus of Nazareth (1977)\n* Death on the Nile (1978)\n* The Cat and the Canary (1979)\n* Ivanhoe (1982)\n\n**Video Games**\n\n* None\n\n**Stage**\n\n* The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1968)\n* Romeo and Juliet (1968)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Olivia_Hussey\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nHussey was born Olivia Osuna on 17 April 1951 [4] in Buenos Aires, Argentina, [5] the first child of Argentine opera singer Andrés Osuna (stage name Osvaldo Ribó), and Joy Hussey, a legal secretary from England [6] Her parents were Roman Catholics, and she was raised in that denomination [7]  Hussey recalled \"I grew up with a mini-altar at home that she had; a candle was always alight on it She always had a great love for God, and she instilled that in me.\" [7] When Hussey was two years old, her parents separated but never divorced.\n\n\nCareer\nHussey appeared in a West End production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, playing Jenny opposite Vanessa Redgrave [12] Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli noticed her performance because \"she was the only choice mature enough with experience and natural beauty to play Juliet while still looking 14.\" [13]    She was chosen out of 500 actresses to star in Zeffirelli's film, opposite 16-year-old Leonard Whiting's Romeo [14] [15] Her performance won her a special David di Donatello Award and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actress in 1969 [16]\n\n\nBreakthrough with Romeo and Juliet\nHussey appeared in a West End production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, playing Jenny opposite Vanessa Redgrave [12] Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli noticed her performance because \"she was the only choice mature enough with experience and natural beauty to play Juliet while still looking 14.\" [13]    She was chosen out of 500 actresses to star in Zeffirelli's film, opposite 16-year-old Leonard Whiting's Romeo [14] [15] Her performance won her a special David di Donatello Award and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year - Actress in 1969 [16]\n\n\nNude scene controversy\nIn an August 2018 interview for Fox News to promote the release of her autobiography Girl on the Balcony, Hussey discussed filming the controversial nude scene in Romeo and Juliet: \"We shot it at the end of the film So by that time...we've become one big family It wasn't that big of a deal And Leonard wasn't shy at all!

{"title": "Amanda_Knox", "content": "\nEarly life\nAmanda Knox was born July 9, 1987, in Seattle, Washington, the eldest of three daughters born to Edda Mellas, a mathematics teacher originally from Germany, [10] and Curt Knox, a vice president of finance for Macy's [11] Knox and her sisters were raised in West Seattle [12] Her parents were divorced when she was 10 years old; [13] her mother then married Chris Mellas, an information-technology consultant [14] [15]\n\n\nItaly\nKnox had come to Perugia for its universities and because it had fewer tourists than Florence, a more popular destination for foreign students [20] Knox lived in a four-bedroom, ground-floor apartment at Via della Pergola 7 with three other women [21] Her flatmates were Kercher (a British exchange student) and two Italian trainee lawyers in their late twenties, [22] one of whom was Filomena Romanelli [23] Kercher and Knox moved in on September 10 and 20, 2007, respectively, meeting each other for the first time [22] Knox was employed part-time at a bar, Le Chic, which was owned by a Congolese man, Diya Patrick Lumumba [24] Kercher's English female friends saw relatively little of Knox, who preferred to socialize with Italians [25]\n\n\nVia della Pergola 7\nKnox had come to Perugia for its universities and because it had fewer tourists than Florence, a more popular destination for foreign students [20] Knox lived in a four-bedroom, ground-floor apartment at Via della Pergola 7 with three other women [21] Her flatmates were Kercher (a British exchange student) and two Italian trainee lawyers in their late twenties, [22] one of whom was Filomena Romanelli [23] Kercher and Knox moved in on September 10 and 20, 2007, respectively, meeting each other for the first time [22] Knox was employed part-time at a bar, Le Chic, which was owned by a Congolese man, Diya Patrick Lumumba [24] Kercher's English female friends saw relatively little of Knox, who preferred to socialize with Italians [25]\n\n\nDiscovery of Meredith Kercher's body\nNovember 1 was a public holiday, and the Italians living in the building were away It is believed that after watching a movie at a friend's house, Kercher returned home around 9 pm that evening and was alone in the building Just after midday on November 2, Knox called Kercher's English phone But contrary to her normal practice, the call was not answered [31] Knox then called her roommate Filomena Romanelli, and in a mixture of Italian and English said she was worried something had happened to Kercher, because upon going to the Via della Pergola 7 apartment earlier that morning, Knox had noticed an open front door, bloodstains (including a footprint) in the bathroom, and Kercher's bedroom door locked [23] Knox and Sollecito then went to Via della Pergola 7, and upon getting no answer from Kercher, unsuccessfully tried to break in the bedroom door, leaving it noticeably damaged [32] At 12:47 p.m., Knox called her mother, who advised her to contact the police [33]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe first detectives on the scene were Monica Napoleoni and her superior Marco Chiacchiera Napoleoni conducted the initial interviews and quizzed Knox about her failure to immediately raise the alarm, which was later widely seen as an anomalous feature of Knox's behavior [35] [36] During her initial questioning, Knox told authorities that Lumumba had broken into the home she shared with Kercher and other roommates, before sexually assaulting and killing her [37] [38] Knox said that she had spent the night of 1 November with Sollecito at his flat, [39] smoking marijuana, watching the French film Amélie, and having sex Sollecito told police he could not remember if Knox was with him that evening or not [40] According to Knox, Napoleoni had been hostile to her from the outset [41] Chiacchiera discounted the signs of a break-in, deeming them clearly faked by the killer [42] The police were not told the extent of Kercher's relationship with Silenzi in initial interviews [43] [44] On November 4, Chiacchiera was quoted as saying that someone known to Kercher might have been let into the apartment and be responsible for her murder The same day, Guede is believed to have left Perugia [45] [46] [47]\n\n\nInterviews, arrest, and arraignment\nOver the following days, Knox was repeatedly interviewed as a witness She told police that on November 1, she received a text from Lumumba advising that her evening waitressing shift had been cancelled, so she had stayed over at Sollecito's apartment, only going back to the apartment she shared with Kercher on the morning the body was discovered [48] On the night of November 5, Knox voluntarily went to the police station Knox was not provided with legal counsel, as Italian law only mandates the appointment of a lawyer for someone suspected of a crime [48] Knox said she had requested a lawyer but was told it would make things worse for her [49] [50] [a]\n\n\nTrial of Guede\nGuede fled to Germany shortly after the murder During a November 19, 2007 Skype conversation with his friend Giacomo Benedetti, Guede did not mention Knox or Sollecito as being in the building on the night of the murder Later his account changed and he indirectly implicated them in the murder, which he denied involvement in Guede was arrested in Germany on November 20, then extradited to Italy on December 6 Guede opted to be tried in a special fast-track procedure by Judge Micheli He was not charged with having had a knife He did not testify and was not questioned about his statements, which he had changed compared to what he originally said [26] [71] [81]\n\n\nFirst trial of Knox and Sollecito\nIn 2009, Knox and Sollecito pleaded not guilty at a corte d'assise on charges of murder, sexual assault, carrying a knife (which Guede had not been charged with), simulating a burglary, and theft of €300, two credit cards, and two mobile phones There was no charge in relation to Kercher's missing keys to the entry door and her bedroom door, although Guede's trial judgement said he had not stolen anything There was a separate but concurrent trial of Knox with the same jury as her murder trial in which she was accused of falsely denouncing her employer for the murder Knox's police interrogation was deemed improper and ruled inadmissible for the murder trial, but was heard in her nominally separate trial for false denunciation [84]\n\n\nProsecution case\nAccording to the prosecution, Knox's first call of November 2, to Kercher's English phone, was to ascertain if Kercher's phones had been found, and Sollecito had tried to break in the bedroom door because after he and Knox locked it behind them, they realized they had left something that might incriminate them [32] Knox's call to her mother in Seattle, 15 minutes before the discovery of the body, was said by prosecutors to show Knox was acting as if something serious might have happened before the point in time when an innocent person would have such concern [85]\n\n\nDefense case\nThe defense suggested that Guede was a lone killer who had murdered Kercher after breaking in Knox's lawyers pointed out that no shoe prints, clothing fibers, hairs, fingerprints, skin cells, or DNA of Knox's were found on Kercher's body, clothes, handbag, or anywhere else in Kercher's bedroom [92] [93] The prosecution alleged that all forensic traces in the room that would have incriminated Knox had been wiped away by her and Sollecito [94] [95] Knox's lawyers said it would have been impossible to selectively remove her traces, and emphasized that Guede's shoe prints, fingerprints, and DNA were found in Kercher's bedroom [96]\n\n\nVerdict and controversy\nOn December 5, 2009, Knox, by then 22, was convicted on charges of faking a break-in, defamation, sexual violence, and murder, and was sentenced to 26 years imprisonment Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years [102] [103] [104] In Italy, opinion was not generally favorable toward Knox, and an Italian law professor remarked: \"This is the simplest and fairest criminal trial one could possibly think of in terms of evidence.\" [105]\n\n\nAcquittal and release\nA corte d'assise verdict of guilty is not a definitive conviction A corte d'assise d'appello reviews the case in what is essentially a new trial The appeal (or second grade) trial began November 2010 and was presided over by Judges Claudio Pratillo Hellmann and Massimo Zanetti A court-ordered review of the contested DNA evidence by independent experts noted numerous basic errors in the gathering and analysis of the evidence, and concluded that no evidential trace of Kercher's DNA had been found on the alleged murder weapon, which police had found in Sollecito's kitchen [112] [113] The review found the forensic police examination showed evidence of multiple males' DNA fragments on the bra clasp, which had been lost on the floor for 47 days, the court-appointed expert testified the context strongly suggested contamination [114] [115] [116] [117] On October 3, 2011, Knox and Sollecito were found not guilty of the murder [118]\n\n\nRetrial\nOn March 26, 2013, Italy's highest court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, set aside the acquittals of the Hellmann second level trial The Court ruled that the Hellmann acquittals had gone beyond the remit of a corte d'assise d'appello by not ordering new DNA tests and by failing to give weight to circumstantial evidence in context, such as Knox's accusation against the bar owner in the disputed interviews A note Knox composed in the police station (not mentioning Guede) was regarded by the Supreme Court as confirmation that she and Guede were present in Via della Pergola 7 while Kercher was attacked [72] A retrial was ordered Knox was represented, but remained in the United States [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nForensic controversy continues\nAlthough not part of the defense's team of experts, an authority on the forensic use of DNA, Professor Peter Gill, publicly said that the case against Knox and Sollecito was misconceived because they had a legitimate excuse for their DNA being present on Sollecito's kitchen knife, and in the crime scene apartment According to Gill, the DNA fragment from Sollecito on the bra clasp could have gotten there through Sollecito having touched the handle of Kercher's door while trying to force it, enabling transfer of his DNA to the bra clasp inside the bedroom on the latex gloves used by investigators [137]\n\n\nFinal decision\nOn March 27, 2015, the ultimate appeal by Knox and Sollecito was heard by the Supreme Court of Cassation; it ruled that the case was without foundation, thereby definitively acquitting them of the murder Her defamation conviction was upheld, but the three-year sentence was deemed served by the time she had already spent in prison [73] [138] [139] [140] Rather than merely declaring that there were errors in the earlier court cases or that there was not enough evidence to convict, the court ruled that Knox and Sollecito were innocent of involvement in the murder [141]\n\n\nCompensation\nOn January 24, 2019, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered Italy to pay compensation to Knox for violating her rights in the hours after her arrest in Perugia Italy was ordered to pay Knox €18,400 (about US$20,800) for not providing her with either a lawyer or a competent interpreter when she was first held in custody [145] [146]\n\n\nRetrial of defamation of Patrick Lumumba\nBased on the ECHR's ruling that she should have been provided with a lawyer and a competent interpreter during the \"obsessively long\" and implicitly violent police interviews (Knox had been acquitted of defamation for saying she had been struck by policewomen during the interrogation), Knox appealed her conviction for defamation of Patrick Lumumba, since the statement that he was involved was made during those interviews, at the same time that it was claimed that she had implicated herself This was her only remaining conviction, and the appeal was enabled by a reform to the code of criminal procedure made in 2022 On 13 October 2023, the Court of Cassation ordered a retrial of this matter [147]\n\n\nPersonal and professional life\nAfter returning to the United States in late 2011, Knox completed her degree and worked on a book about her case She was often followed by paparazzi Her family incurred large debts from the years of supporting her in Italy and were left insolvent, the proceeds from Waiting to Be Heard: A Memoir having gone to pay legal fees to her Italian lawyers [5] [149] Knox has been a reviewer and journalist for the then West Seattle Herald, later subsumed into Westside Seattle, and attended events of the Innocence Project and related organizations [6]\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nDocumentaries\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nSee

convicted, and sentenced to prison for the murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy. Knox's case drew international attention and sparked heated debates about her guilt and the fairness of the trial. After a lengthy and complex legal process, Knox was acquitted and released from prison.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAmanda Knox was born on July 9, 1987, in Seattle, Washington, to Edda Mellas and Curt Knox. She is the eldest of three daughters. Her parents were divorced when Knox was 10 years old, and her mother later married Chris Mellas, an information-technology consultant. Knox and her sisters were raised in West Seattle.\n\n**Italy**\n\nIn 2007, Knox traveled to Perugia, Italy, to study abroad at the University of Perugia. She chose Perugia because it had fewer tourists than Florence, a more popular destination for foreign students. Knox lived in a four-bedroom, ground-floor apartment at Via della Pergola 7 with three other women, including Meredith Kercher, a British exchange student. Knox and Kercher moved in on September 10 and 20, 2007, respectively, meeting each other for the first time. Knox was employed part-time at a bar, Le Chic, which was owned by a Congolese man, Diya Patrick Lumumba.\n\n**Discovery of Meredith Kercher's Body**\n\nOn November 1, 2007, Knox called Kercher's English phone, but contrary to her normal practice, the call was not answered. Knox then called her roommate Filomena Romanelli, and in a mixture of Italian and English said she was worried something had happened to Kercher. Knox and Sollecito then went to Via della Pergola 7, and upon getting no answer from Kercher, unsuccessfully tried to break in the bedroom door, leaving it noticeably damaged. At 12:47 p.m., Knox called her mother, who advised her to contact the police.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe first detectives on the scene were Monica Napoleoni and h", "prompt": "Write a complete

tourists than Florence, a more popular destination for foreign students [20] Knox lived in a four-bedroom, ground-floor apartment at Via della Pergola 7 with three other women [21] Her flatmates were

of Knox, who preferred to socialize with Italians [25]\n\n\nDiscovery of Meredith Kercher's body\nNovember 1 was a public holiday, and the Italians living in the building were away It is believed that after watching a movie at a friend's house, Kercher returned home around 9 pm that evening and was alone in the building Just after midday on November 2, Knox called Kercher's English phone But contrary to her normal practice, the call was not answered [31] Knox then called her roommate Filomena Romanelli, and in a mixture of Italian and English said she was worried something had happened to Kercher, because upon going to the Via della Pergola 7 apartment earlier that morning, Knox had noticed an open front door, bloodstains (including a footprint) in the bathroom, and Kercher's bedroom door locked [23] Knox and Sollecito then went to Via della Pergola 7, and upon getting no answer from Kercher, unsuccessfully tried to break in the bedroom door, leaving it noticeably damaged [32] At 12:47 p.m., Knox called her mother, who advised her to contact the police [33]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe first detectives on the scene were Monica Napoleoni and her superior Marco Chiacchiera Napoleoni conducted the initial interviews and quizzed Knox about her failure to immediately raise the alarm, which was later widely seen as an anomalous feature of Knox's behavior [35] [36] During her initial questioning, Knox told authorities that Lumumba had broken into the home she shared with Kercher and other roommates, before sexually assaulting and killing her [37] [38] Knox said that she had spent the night of 1 November with Sollecito at his flat, [39] smoking marijuana, watching the French film Amélie, and having sex Sollecito told police he could not remember if Knox was with him that evening or not [40] According to Knox, Napoleoni had been hostile to her from the outset [41] Chiacchiera discounted the signs of a break-in, deeming them clearly faked by the killer [42] The police were not told the extent of Kercher's relationship with Silenzi in initial interviews [43] [44] On November 4, Chiacchiera was quoted as saying that someone known to Kercher might have been let into the apartment and be responsible for her murder The same day, Guede is believed to have left Perugia [45] [46] [47]\n\n\nInterviews, arrest, and arraignment\nOver the following days, Knox was repeatedly interviewed as a witness She told police that on November 1, she received a text from Lumumba advising that her evening waitressing shift had been cancelled, so she had stayed over at Sollecito's apartment, only going back to the apartment she shared with Kercher on the morning the body was discovered [48] On the night of November 5, Knox voluntarily went to the police station Knox was not provided with legal counsel, as Italian law only mandates the appointment of a lawyer for someone suspected of a crime [48] Knox said she had requested a lawyer but was told it would make things worse for her [49] [50] [a]\n\n\nTrial of Guede\nGuede fled to Germany shortly after the murder During a November 19, 2007 Skype conversation with his friend Giacomo Benedetti, Guede did not mention Knox or Sollecito as being in the building on the night of the murder Later his account changed and he indirectly implicated them in the murder, which he denied involvement in Guede was arrested in Germany on November 20, then extradited to Italy on December 6 Guede opted to be tried in a special fast-track procedure by Judge Micheli He was not charged with having had a knife He did not testify and was not questioned about his statements, which he had changed compared to what he originally said [26] [71] [81]\n\n\nFirst trial of Knox and Sollecito\nIn 2009, Knox and Sollecito pleaded not guilty at a corte d'assise on charges of murder, sexual assault, carrying a knife (which Guede had not been charged with), simulating a burglary, and theft of €300, two credit cards, and two mobile phones There was no charge in relation to Kercher's missing keys to the entry door and her bedroom door, although Guede's trial judgement said he had not stolen anything There was a separate but concurrent trial of Knox with the same jury as her murder trial in which she was accused of falsely denouncing her employer for the murder Knox's police interrogation was deemed improper and ruled inadmissible for the murder trial, but was heard in her nominally separate trial for false denunciation [84]\n\n\nProsecution case\nAccording to the prosecution, Knox's first call of November 2, to Kercher's English phone, was to ascertain if Kercher's phones had been found, and Sollecito had tried to break in the bedroom door because after he and Knox locked it behind them, they realized they had left something that might incriminate them [32] Knox's call to her mother in Seattle, 15 minutes before the discovery of the body, was said by prosecutors to show Knox was acting as if something serious might have happened before the point in time when an innocent person would have such concern [85]\n\n\nDefense case\nThe defense suggested that Guede was a lone killer who had murdered Kercher after breaking in Knox's lawyers pointed out that no shoe prints, clothing fibers, hairs, fingerprints, skin cells, or DNA of Knox's were found on Kercher's body, clothes, handbag, or anywhere else in Kercher's bedroom [92] [93] The prosecution alleged that all forensic traces in the room that would have incriminated Knox had been wiped away by her and Sollecito [94] [95] Knox's lawyers said it would have been impossible to selectively remove her traces, and emphasized that Guede's shoe prints, fingerprints, and DNA were found in Kercher's bedroom [96]\n\n\nVerdict and controversy\nOn December 5, 2009, Knox, by then 22, was convicted on charges of faking a break-in, defamation, sexual violence, and murder, and was sentenced to 26 years imprisonment Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years [102] [103] [104] In Italy, opinion was not generally favorable toward Knox, and an Italian law professor remarked: \"This is the simplest and fairest criminal trial one could possibly think of in terms of evidence.\" [105]\n\n\nAcquittal and release\nA corte d'assise verdict of guilty is not a definitive conviction A corte d'assise d'appello reviews the case in what is essentially a new trial The appeal (or second grade) trial began November 2010 and was presided over by Judges Claudio Pratillo Hellmann and Massimo Zanetti A court-ordered review of the contested DNA evidence by independent experts noted numerous basic errors in the gathering and analysis of the evidence, and concluded that no evidential trace of Kercher's DNA had been found on the alleged murder weapon, which police had found in Sollecito's kitchen [112] [113] The review found the forensic police examination showed evidence of multiple males' DNA fragments on the bra clasp, which had been lost on the floor for 47 days, the court-appointed expert testified the context strongly suggested contamination [114] [115] [116] [117] On October 3, 2011, Knox and Sollecito were found not guilty of the murder [118]\n\n\nRetrial\nOn March 26, 2013, Italy's highest court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, set aside the acquittals of the Hellmann second level trial The Court ruled that the Hellmann acquittals had gone beyond the remit of a corte d'assise d'appello by not ordering new DNA tests and by failing to give weight to circumstantial evidence in context, such as Knox's accusation against the bar owner in the disputed interviews A note Knox composed in the police station (not mentioning Guede) was regarded by the Supreme Court as confirmation that she and Guede were present in Via della Pergola 7 while Kercher was attacked [72] A retrial was ordered Knox was represented, but remained in the United States [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nForensic controversy continues\nAlthough not part of the defense's team of experts, an authority on the forensic use of DNA, Professor Peter Gill, publicly said that the case against Knox and Sollecito was misconceived because they had a legitimate excuse for their DNA being present on Sollecito's kitchen knife, and in the crime scene apartment According to Gill, the DNA fragment from Sollecito on the bra clasp could have gotten there through Sollecito having touched the handle of Kercher's door while trying to force it, enabling transfer of his DNA to the bra clasp inside the bedroom on the latex gloves used by investigators [137]\n\n\nFinal decision\nOn March 27, 2015, the ultimate appeal by Knox and Sollecito was heard by the Supreme Court of Cassation; it ruled that the case was without foundation, thereby definitively acquitting them of the murder Her defamation conviction was upheld, but the three-year sentence was deemed served by the time she had already spent in prison [73] [138] [139] [140] Rather than merely declaring that there were errors in the earlier court cases or that there was not enough evidence to convict, the court ruled that Knox and Sollecito were innocent of involvement in the murder [141]\n\n\nCompensation\nOn January 24, 2019, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordered Italy to pay compensation to Knox for violating her rights in the hours after her arrest in Perugia Italy was ordered to pay Knox €18,400 (about US$20,800) for not providing her with either a lawyer or a competent interpreter when she was first held in custody [145] [146]\n\n\nRetrial of defamation of Patrick Lumumba\nBased on the ECHR's ruling that she should have been provided with a lawyer and a competent interpreter during the \"obsessively long\" and implicitly violent police interviews (Knox had been acquitted of defamation for saying she had been struck by policewomen during the interrogation), Knox appealed her conviction for defamation of Patrick Lumumba, since the statement that

the code of criminal procedure made in 2022 On 13 October 2023, the Court of Cassation ordered a retrial of this matter [147]\n\n\nPersonal and professional life\nAfter returning to the United States

{"title": "Poland", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe native Polish name for Poland is Polska [17] The name is derived from the Polans, a West Slavic tribe who inhabited the Warta River basin of present-day Greater Poland region (6th–8th century CE) [18] The tribe's name stems from the Proto-Slavic noun pole meaning field, which in-itself originates from the Proto-Indo-European word *pleh₂- indicating flatland [19] The etymology alludes to the topography of the region and the flat landscape of Greater Poland [20] [21] During the Middle Ages, the Latin form Polonia was widely used throughout Europe [22]\n\n\nHistory\nThe first Stone Age archaic humans and Homo erectus species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments [28] The arrival of Homo sapiens and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period (Northern Polish glaciation 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable [29] Neolithic excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish Kuyavia, [30] and the Bronocice pot is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC) [31]\n\n\nPrehistory and protohistory\nThe first Stone Age archaic humans and Homo erectus species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago, though the ensuing hostile climate prevented early humans from founding more permanent encampments [28] The arrival of Homo sapiens and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period (Northern Polish glaciation 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable [29] Neolithic excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish Kuyavia, [30] and the Bronocice pot is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC) [31]\n\n\nKingdom of Poland\nPoland began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the Piast dynasty [40] In 966, ruler of the Polans Mieszko I accepted Christianity under the auspices of the Roman Church with the Baptism of Poland [41] In 968, a missionary bishopric was established in Poznań An incipit titled Dagome iudex first defined Poland's geographical boundaries with its capital in Gniezno and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the Apostolic See [42] The country's early origins were described by Gallus Anonymus in Gesta principum Polonorum, the oldest Polish chronicle [43] An important national event of the period was the martyrdom of Saint Adalbert, who was killed by Prussian pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko's successor, Bolesław I the Brave [42]\n\n\nPolish–Lithuanian Commonwealth\nThe Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unified federal state with an elective monarchy, but largely governed by the nobility [76] The latter coincided with a period of prosperity; the Polish-dominated union thereafter becoming a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central, Eastern, Southeastern and Northern Europe The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately 1 million km2 (390,000 sq mi) at its peak and was the largest state in Europe [77] [78] Simultaneously, Poland imposed Polonisation policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities [76]\n\n\nPartitions\nThe royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski to the monarchy [93] His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress Catherine II of Russia [94] The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states [95] His ideals led to the formation of the 1768 Bar Confederation, a rebellion directed against the Poniatowski and all external influence, which ineptly aimed to preserve Poland's sovereignty and privileges held by the nobility [96] The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to invade [97]\n\n\nEra of insurrections\nThe Polish people rose several times against the partitioners and occupying armies An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, where a popular and distinguished general Tadeusz Kościuszko, who had several years earlier served under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War, led Polish insurgents [107] Despite the victory at the Battle of Racławice, his ultimate defeat ended Poland's independent existence for 123 years [108]\n\n\nSecond Polish Republic\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the Allies agreed on the reconstitution of Poland, confirmed through the Treaty of Versailles of June 1919 [116] A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died [117] Following the armistice with Germany in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic [118]\n\n\nWorld War II\nWorld War II began with the Nazi German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, followed by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September On 28 September 1939, Warsaw fell As agreed in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Poland was split into two zones, one occupied by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles The Soviet NKVD executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (among other incidents in the Katyn massacre) ahead of Operation Barbarossa [123] German planners had in November 1939 called for \"the complete destruction of all Poles\" and their fate as outlined in the genocidal Generalplan Ost [124]\n\n\nPost-war communism\nAt the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London This action angered many Poles who considered it a betrayal by the Allies In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to Churchill and Roosevelt that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organised by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs The Soviet Union instituted a new communist government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the Eastern Bloc As elsewhere in Communist Europe, the Soviet influence over Poland was met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the 1950s [153]\n\n\nThird Polish Republic\nA shock therapy program, initiated by Leszek Balcerowicz in the early 1990s, enabled the country to transform its Soviet-style planned economy into a market economy [158] As with other post-communist countries, Poland suffered temporary declines in social, economic, and living standards, [159] but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 GDP levels as early as 1995, although the unemployment rate increased [160] Poland became a member of the Visegrád Group in 1991, [161] and joined NATO in 1999 [162] Poles then voted to join the European Union in a referendum in June 2003, [163] with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004, following the consequent enlargement of the organisation [164]\n\n\nGeography\nPoland covers an administrative area of 312,722 km2 (120,743 sq mi), and is the ninth-largest country in Europe Approximately 311,895 km2 (120,423 sq mi) of the country's territory consists of land, 2,041 km2 (788 sq mi) is internal waters and 8,783 km2 (3,391 sq mi) is territorial sea [175] Topographically, the landscape of Poland is characterised by diverse landforms, water bodies and ecosystems [176] The central and northern region bordering the Baltic Sea lie within the flat Central European Plain, but its south is hilly and mountainous [177] The average elevation above the sea level is estimated at 173 metres [175]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Poland is temperate transitional, and varies from oceanic in the north-west to continental in the south-east [185] The mountainous southern fringes are situated within an alpine climate [185] Poland is characterised by warm summers, with a mean temperature of around 20 °C (68.0 °F) in July, and moderately cold winters averaging −1 °C (30.2 °F) in December [186] The warmest and sunniest part of Poland is Lower Silesia in the southwest and the coldest region is the northeast corner, around Suwałki in Podlaskie province, where the climate is affected by cold fronts from Scandinavia and Siberia [187] Precipitation is more frequent during the summer months, with highest rainfall recorded from June to September [186]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nPhytogeographically, Poland belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom The country has four Palearctic ecoregions – Central, Northern, Western European temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and the Carpathian montane conifer Forests occupy 31% of Poland's land area, the largest of which is the Lower Silesian Wilderness [188] The most common deciduous trees found across the country are oak, maple, and beech; the most common conifers are pine, spruce, and fir [189] An estimated 69% of all forests are coniferous [190]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nPoland is a unitary semi-presidential republic [198] and a representative democracy, with a president as the head of state [199] The executive power is exercised further by the Council of Ministers and the prime minister who acts as the head of government [199] The council's individual members are selected by the prime minister, approved by parliament and sworn in by the president [199] The head of state is elected by popular vote for a five-year term [200] The current president is Andrzej Duda and the prime minister is Donald Tusk.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nPoland is divided into 16 provinces or states known as voivodeships [207] As of 2022, the voivodeships are subdivided into 380 counties (powiats), which are further fragmented into 2,477 municipalities (gminas) [207] Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat [207] The provinces are largely founded on the borders of historic regions, or named for individual cities [208] Administrative authority at the voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed governor (voivode), an elected regional assembly (sejmik) and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by the assembly [208]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Poland is the enacted supreme law, and Polish judicature is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of civil law [210] The current democratic constitution was adopted by the National Assembly of Poland on 2 April 1997; it guarantees a multi-party state with freedoms of religion, speech and gatherings, prohibits the practices of forced medical experimentation, torture or corporal punishment, and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form trade unions, and the right to strike [211]\n\n\nForeign relations\nPoland is a middle power and is transitioning into a regional power in Europe [221] [222] It has a total of 53 representatives in the European Parliament as of 2024 Warsaw serves as the headquarters for Frontex, the European Union's agency for external border security as well as ODIHR, one of the principal institutions of the OSCE [223] [224] Apart from the European Union, Poland has been a member of NATO, the United Nations, and the WTO.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Polish Armed Forces are composed of five branches – the Land Forces, the Navy, the Air Force, the Special Forces and the Territorial Defence Force [227] The military is subordinate to the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland [227] However, its commander-in-chief in peacetime is the president, who nominates officers, the Minister for National Defence and the chief of staff [227] Polish military tradition is generally commemorated by the Armed Forces Day, celebrated annually on 15 August [228] As of 2022, the Polish Armed Forces have a combined strength of 114,050 active soldiers, with a further 75,400 active in the gendarmerie and defence force [229]\n\n\nSecurity, law enforcement and emergency services\nThanks to its location, Poland is a country essentially free from the threat of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes and tropical cyclones However, floods have occurred in low-lying areas from time to time during periods of extreme rainfall (e.g during the 2010 Central European floods).\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of 2023 [update], Poland's economy and gross domestic product (GDP) is the sixth largest in the European Union by nominal standards and the fifth largest by purchasing power parity It is also one of the fastest growing within the Union and reached a developed market status in 2018 [250] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat in 2023 amounted to 2.8%, which was the second-lowest in the EU [248] As of 2023 [update], around 62% of the employed population works in the service sector, 29% in manufacturing, and 8% in the agricultural sector [251] Although Poland is a member of the European single market, the country has not adopted the Euro as legal tender and maintains its own currency – the Polish złoty (zł, PLN).\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2020, the total value of the tourism industry in Poland was 104.3 billion PLN, then equivalent to 4.5% of the Polish GDP [261] Tourism contributes considerably to the overall economy and makes up a relatively large proportion of the country's service market [262] Nearly 200,000 people were employed in the accommodation and catering (hospitality) sector in 2020 [261] In 2021, Poland ranked 12th most visited country in the world by international arrivals [263]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of rail, road, marine shipping and air travel The country is part of EU's Schengen Area and is an important transport hub due to its strategic geographical position in Central Europe [268] Some of the longest European routes, including the E30 and E40, run through Poland The country has a good network of highways consisting of express roads and motorways As of August 2023, Poland has the world's 21st-largest road network, maintaining over 5,000 km (3,100 mi) of highways in use [269]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe electricity generation sector in Poland is largely fossil-fuel–based Coal production in Poland is a major source of employment and the largest source of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions [275] Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in the production of their energy The three largest Polish coal mining firms (Węglokoks, Kompania Węglowa and JSW) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually [276] After coal, Polish energy supply relies significantly on oil—the nation is the third-largest buyer of Russian oil exports to the EU [277]\n\n\nScience and technology\nOver the course of history, the Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics [280] Perhaps the most renowned Pole to support this theory was Nicolaus Copernicus (Mikołaj Kopernik), who triggered the Copernican Revolution by placing the Sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe [281] He also derived a quantity theory of money, which made him a pioneer of economics Copernicus' achievements and discoveries are considered the basis of Polish culture and cultural identity [282] Poland was ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [283]\n\n\nDemographics\nPoland has a population of approximately 38.2 million as of 2021, and is the ninth-most populous country in Europe, as well as the fifth-most populous member state of the European Union [285] It has a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometre (320 inhabitants/sq mi) [286] The total fertility rate was estimated at 1.33 children born to a woman in 2021, which is among the world's lowest [287] Furthermore, Poland's population is aging significantly, and the country has a median age of 42.2 [288]\n\n\nLanguages\nPolish is the official and predominant spoken language in Poland, and is one of the official languages of the European Union [304] It is also a second language in parts of neighbouring Lithuania, where it is taught in Polish-minority schools [305] [306] Contemporary Poland is a linguistically homogeneous nation, with 97% of respondents declaring Polish as their mother tongue [307] There are currently 15 minority languages in Poland, [308] including one recognised regional language, Kashubian, which is spoken by approximately 100,000 people on a daily basis in the northern regions of Kashubia and Pomerania [309] Poland also recognises secondary administrative languages or auxiliary languages in bilingual municipalities, where bilingual signs and placenames are commonplace [310] According to the Centre for Public Opinion Research, around 32% of Polish citizens declared knowledge of the English language in 2015 [311]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2021 census, 71.3% of all Polish citizens adhere to the Roman Catholic Church, with 6.9% identifying as having no religion and 20.6% refusing to answer [3]\n\n\nHealth\nMedical service providers and hospitals in Poland are subordinate to the Ministry of Health; it provides administrative oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice, and is obliged to maintain a high standard of hygiene and patient care Poland has a universal healthcare system based on an all-inclusive insurance system; state subsidised healthcare is available to all citizens covered by the general health insurance program of the National Health Fund (NFZ) Private medical complexes exist nationwide; over 50% of the population uses both public and private sectors [320] [321] [322]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Jagiellonian University founded in 1364 by Casimir III in Kraków was the first institution of higher learning established in Poland, and is one of the oldest universities still in continuous operation [327] Poland's Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej), established in 1773, was the world's first state ministry of education [328] [329] In 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, placed Poland's educational output as one of the highest in the OECD, ranking 5th by student attainment and 6th by student performance in 2022 [330] The study showed that students in Poland perform better academically than in most OECD countries [331]\n\n\nEthnicity\nEthnic structure of Poland by voivodeship according to the censuses of 2002, 2011 and 2021: [339] [340] [341]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1,000-year history, and forms an important constituent in the Western civilisation [342] The Poles take great pride in their national identity which is often associated with the colours white and red, and exuded by the expression biało-czerwoni (\"whitereds\") [343] National symbols, chiefly the crowned white-tailed eagle, are often visible on clothing, insignia and emblems [344] The architectural monuments of great importance are protected by the National Heritage Board of Poland [345] Over 100 of the country's most significant tangible wonders were enlisted onto the Historic Monuments Register, [346] with further 17 being recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites [347]\n\n\nHolidays and traditions\nThere are 13 government-approved annual public holidays – New Year on 1 January, Three Kings' Day on 6 January, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, Labour Day on 1 May, Constitution Day on 3 May, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, Feast of the Assumption on 15 August, All Saints' Day on 1 November, Independence Day on 11 November and Christmastide on 25 and 26 December [348]\n\n\nMusic\nArtists from Poland, including famous musicians such as Frédéric Chopin, Artur Rubinstein, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Henryk Wieniawski, Karol Szymanowski, Witold Lutosławski, Stanisław Moniuszko and traditional, regionalised folk composers create a lively and diverse music scene, which even recognises its own music genres, such as sung poetry and disco polo [355]\n\n\nArt\nArt in Poland has invariably reflected European trends, with Polish painting pivoted on folklore, Catholic themes, historicism and realism, but also on Impressionism and romanticism An important art movement was Young Poland, developed in the late 19th century for promoting decadence, symbolism and Art Nouveau Since the 20th century Polish documentary art and photography has enjoyed worldwide fame, especially the Polish School of Posters [360] One of the most distinguished paintings in Poland is Lady with an Ermine (1490) by Leonardo da Vinci [361]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Poland reflects European architectural styles, with strong historical influences derived from Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries [364] Settlements founded on Magdeburg Law evolved around central marketplaces (plac, rynek), encircled by a grid or concentric network of streets forming an old town (stare miasto) [365] Poland's traditional landscape is characterised by ornate churches, city tenements and town halls [366] Cloth hall markets (sukiennice) were once an abundant feature of Polish urban architecture [367] The mountainous south is known for its Zakopane chalet style, which originated in Poland [368]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe literary works of Poland have traditionally concentrated around the themes of patriotism, spirituality, social allegories and moral narratives [379] The earliest examples of Polish literature, written in Latin, date to the 12th century [380] The first Polish phrase Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai (officially translated as \"Let me, I shall grind, and you take a rest\") was documented in the Book of Henryków and reflected the use of a quern-stone [381] It has been since included in UNESCO's Memory of World Register [382] The oldest extant manuscripts of fine prose in Old Polish are the Holy Cross Sermons and the Bible of Queen Sophia, [383] and Calendarium cracoviense (1474) is Poland's oldest surviving print [384]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of Poland is eclectic and shares similarities with other regional cuisines Among the staple or regional dishes are pierogi (filled dumplings), kielbasa (sausage), bigos (hunter's stew), kotlet schabowy (breaded cutlet), gołąbki (cabbage rolls), barszcz (borscht), żurek (soured rye soup), oscypek (smoked cheese), and tomato soup [396] [397] Bagels, a type of bread roll, also originated in Poland [398]\n\n\nFashion and design\nSeveral Polish designers and stylists left a legacy of beauty inventions and cosmetics; including Helena Rubinstein and Maksymilian Faktorowicz, who created a line of cosmetics company in California known as Max Factor and formulated the term \"make-up\" which is now widely used as an alternative for describing cosmetics [406] Faktorowicz is also credited with inventing modern eyelash extensions [407] [408] As of 2020, Poland possesses the sixth-largest cosmetic market in Europe Inglot Cosmetics is the country's largest beauty products manufacturer, [409] and the retail store Reserved is the country's most successful clothing store chain [410]\n\n\nCinema\nThe cinema of Poland traces its origins to 1894, when inventor Kazimierz Prószyński patented the Pleograph and subsequently the Aeroscope, the first successful hand-held operated film camera [413] [414] In 1897, Jan Szczepanik constructed the Telectroscope, a prototype of television transmitting images and sounds [413] They are both recognised as pioneers of cinematography [413] Poland has also produced influential directors, film producers and actors, many of whom were active in Hollywood, chiefly Roman Polański, Andrzej Wajda, Pola Negri, Samuel Goldwyn, the Warner brothers, Max Fleischer, Agnieszka Holland, Krzysztof Zanussi and Krzysztof Kieślowski [415]\n\n\nMedia\nAccording to the Eurobarometer Report (2015), 78 percent of Poles watch the television daily [416] In 2020, 79 percent of the population read the news more than once a day, placing it second behind Sweden [417] Poland has a number of major domestic media outlets, chiefly the public broadcasting corporation TVP, free-to-air channels TVN and Polsat as well as 24-hour news channels TVP Info, TVN 24 and Polsat News [418] Public television extends its operations to genre-specific programmes such as TVP Sport, TVP Historia, TVP Kultura, TVP Rozrywka, TVP Seriale and TVP Polonia, the latter a state-run channel dedicated to the transmission of Polish-language telecasts for the Polish diaspora In 2020, the most popular types of newspapers were tabloids and socio-political news dailies [416]\n\n\nSports\nMotorcycle Speedway, volleyball and association football are among the country's most popular sports, with a rich history of international competitions [420] [421] Track and field, basketball, handball, boxing, MMA, ski jumping, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, tennis, fencing, swimming, and weightlifting are other popular sports.\nThe golden era of football in Poland occurred throughout the 1970s and went on until the early 1980s when the Polish national football team achieved their best results in any FIFA World Cup competitions finishing third place in the 1974 and the 1982 tournaments The team won a gold medal in football at the 1972 Summer Olympics and two silver medals, in 1976 and in 1992 In 2012, Poland co-hosted the UEFA European Football Championship [422]\n\n\nSee also\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20\n\n\nNotes\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20\n\n\nReferences\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20\n\n\nWorks

country located in Central Europe. It is bordered by Germany to the west, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and Belarus to the east, and the Baltic Sea and Kaliningrad Oblast (a part of Russia) to the north. The country has a rich history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era. Today, Poland is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe native Polish name for Poland is Polska. The name is derived from the Polans, a West Slavic tribe who inhabited the Warta River basin of present-day Greater Poland region. The tribe's name stems from the Proto-Slavic noun pole meaning field, which in itself originates from the Proto-Indo-European word *pleh₂- indicating flatland. The etymology alludes to the topography of the region and the flat landscape of Greater Poland. During the Middle Ages, the Latin form Polonia was widely used throughout Europe.\n\n## History\n\nThe first Stone Age archaic humans and Homo erectus species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago. The arrival of Homo sapiens and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period (Northern Polish glaciation 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable. Neolithic excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish Kuyavia, and the Bronocice pot is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC).\n\n## Prehistory and Protohistory\n\nThe first Stone Age archaic humans and Homo erectus species settled what was to become Poland approximately 500,000 years ago. The arrival of Homo sapiens and anatomically modern humans coincided with the climatic discontinuity at the end of the Last Glacial Period (Northern Polish glaciation 10,000 BC), when Poland became habitable. Neolithic excavations indicated broad-ranging development in that era; the earliest evidence of European cheesemaking (5500 BC) was discovered in Polish Kuyavia, and the Bronocice pot is incised with the earliest known depiction of what may be a wheeled vehicle (3400 BC).\n\n## Kingdom of Poland\n\nPoland began to form into a recognisable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the Piast dynasty. In 966, ruler of the Polans Mieszko I accepted Christianity under the auspices of the Roman Church with the Baptism of Poland. In 968, a missionary bishopric was established in Poznań. An incipit titled Dagome iudex first defined Poland's geographical boundaries with its capital in Gniezno and affirmed that its monarchy was under the protection of the Apostolic See. The country's early origins were described by Gallus Anonymus in Gesta principum Polonorum, the oldest Polish chronicle. An important national event of the period was the martyrdom of Saint Adalbert, who was killed by Prussian pagans in 997 and whose remains were reputedly bought back for their weight in gold by Mieszko's successor, Bolesław I the Brave.\n\n## Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\n\nThe Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unified federal state with an elective monarchy, but largely governed by the nobility. The latter coincided with a period of prosperity; the Polish-dominated union thereafter becoming a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central, Eastern, Southeastern and Northern Europe. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately 1 million km2 (390,000 sq mi) at its peak and was the largest state in Europe. Simultaneously, Poland imposed Polonisation policies in newly acquired territories which were met with resistance from ethnic and religious minorities.\n\n## Partitions\n\nThe royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of Stanisław II Augustus Poniatowski to the monarchy. His candidacy was extensively funded by his sponsor and former lover, Empress Catherine II of Russia. The new king maneuvered between his desire to implement necessary modernising reforms, and the necessity to remain at peace with surrounding states. His ideals led to the formation of the 1768 Bar Confederation, a rebellion directed against the Poniatowski and all external influence, which ineptly aimed to preserve Poland's sovereignty and privileges held by the nobility. The failed attempts at government restructuring as well as the domestic turmoil provoked its neighbours to invade.\n\n## Era of Insurrections\n\nThe Polish people rose several times against the partitioners and occupying armies. An unsuccessful attempt at defending Poland's sovereignty took place in the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, where a popular and distinguished general Tadeusz Kościuszko, who had several years earlier served under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War, led Polish insurgents. Despite the victory at the Battle of Racławice, his ultimate defeat ended Poland's independent existence for 123 years.\n\n## Second Polish Republic\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the Allies agreed on the reconstitution of Poland, confirmed through the Treaty of Versailles of June 1919. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died. Following the armistice with Germany in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic.\n\n## World War II\n\nWorld War II began with the Nazi German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, followed by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September. On 28 September 1939, Warsaw fell.

Commonwealth\nThe Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unified federal state with an elective monarchy, but largely governed by the nobility [76] The latter coincided with a period of prosperity; the Polish-dominated union thereafter becoming a leading power and a major cultural entity, exercising political control over parts of Central, Eastern, Southeastern and Northern Europe The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied approximately 1 million km2 (390,000 sq mi) at its peak and was the largest state in Europe [77] [78] Simultaneously,

million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and over 450,000 died [117] Following the armistice with Germany in November 1918, Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic [118]\n\n\nWorld War II\nWorld War II began with the Nazi German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, followed by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September On 28 September 1939, Warsaw fell As agreed in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Poland was split into two zones, one occupied by Nazi Germany, the other by the Soviet Union In 1939–1941, the Soviets deported hundreds of thousands of Poles The Soviet NKVD executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war (among other incidents in the Katyn massacre) ahead of Operation Barbarossa [123] German planners had in November 1939 called for \"the complete destruction of all Poles\" and their fate as outlined in the genocidal Generalplan Ost [124]\n\n\nPost-war communism\nAt the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the Yalta Conference sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London This action angered many Poles who considered it a betrayal by the Allies In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to Churchill and Roosevelt that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organised by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs The Soviet Union instituted a new communist government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the Eastern Bloc As elsewhere in Communist Europe, the Soviet influence over Poland was met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the 1950s [153]\n\n\nThird Polish Republic\nA shock therapy program, initiated by Leszek Balcerowicz in the early 1990s, enabled the country to transform its Soviet-style planned economy into a market economy [158] As with other post-communist countries, Poland suffered temporary declines in social, economic, and living standards, [159] but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 GDP levels as early as 1995, although the unemployment rate increased [160] Poland became a member of the Visegrád Group in 1991, [161] and joined NATO in 1999 [162] Poles then voted to join the European Union in a referendum in June 2003, [163] with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004, following the consequent enlargement of the organisation [164]\n\n\nGeography\nPoland covers an administrative area of 312,722 km2 (120,743 sq mi), and is the ninth-largest country in Europe Approximately 311,895 km2 (120,423 sq mi) of the country's territory consists of land, 2,041 km2 (788 sq mi) is internal waters and 8,783 km2 (3,391 sq mi) is territorial sea [175] Topographically, the landscape of Poland is characterised by diverse landforms, water bodies and ecosystems [176] The central and northern region bordering the Baltic Sea lie within the flat Central European Plain, but its south is hilly and mountainous [177] The average elevation above the sea level is estimated at 173 metres [175]\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Poland is temperate transitional, and varies from oceanic in the north-west to continental in the south-east [185] The mountainous southern fringes are situated within an alpine climate [185] Poland is characterised by warm summers, with a mean temperature of around 20 °C (68.0 °F) in July, and moderately cold winters averaging −1 °C (30.2 °F) in December [186] The warmest and sunniest part of Poland is Lower Silesia in the southwest and the coldest region is the northeast corner, around Suwałki in Podlaskie province, where the climate is affected by cold fronts from Scandinavia and Siberia [187] Precipitation is more frequent during the summer months, with highest rainfall recorded from June to September [186]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nPhytogeographically, Poland belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom The country has four Palearctic ecoregions – Central, Northern, Western European temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and the Carpathian montane conifer Forests occupy 31% of Poland's land area, the largest of which is the Lower Silesian Wilderness [188] The most common deciduous trees found across the country are oak, maple, and beech; the most common conifers are pine, spruce, and fir [189] An estimated 69% of all forests are coniferous [190]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nPoland is a unitary semi-presidential republic [198] and a representative democracy, with a president as the head of state [199] The executive power is exercised further by the Council of Ministers and the prime minister who acts as the head of government [199] The council's individual members are selected by the prime minister, approved by parliament and sworn in by the president [199] The head of state is elected by popular vote for a five-year term [200] The current president is Andrzej Duda and the prime minister is Donald Tusk.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nPoland is divided into 16 provinces or states known as voivodeships [207] As of 2022, the voivodeships are subdivided into 380 counties (powiats), which are further fragmented into 2,477 municipalities (gminas) [207] Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat [207] The provinces are largely founded on the borders of historic regions, or named for individual cities [208] Administrative authority at the voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed governor (voivode), an elected regional assembly (sejmik) and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by the assembly [208]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Poland is the enacted supreme law, and Polish judicature is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of civil law [210] The current democratic constitution was adopted by the National Assembly of Poland on 2 April 1997; it guarantees a multi-party state with freedoms of religion, speech and gatherings, prohibits the practices of forced medical experimentation, torture or corporal punishment, and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form trade unions, and the right to strike [211]\n\n\nForeign relations\nPoland is a middle power and is transitioning into a regional power in Europe [221] [222] It has a total of 53 representatives in the European Parliament as of 2024 Warsaw serves as the headquarters for Frontex, the European Union's agency for external border security as well as ODIHR, one of the principal institutions of the OSCE [223] [224] Apart from the European Union, Poland has been a member of NATO, the United Nations, and the WTO.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Polish Armed Forces are composed of five branches – the Land Forces, the Navy, the Air Force, the Special Forces and the Territorial Defence Force [227] The military is subordinate to the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland [227] However, its commander-in-chief in peacetime is the president, who nominates officers, the Minister for National Defence and the chief of staff [227] Polish military tradition is generally commemorated by the Armed Forces Day, celebrated annually on 15 August [228] As of 2022, the Polish Armed Forces have a combined strength of 114,050 active soldiers, with a further 75,400 active in the gendarmerie and defence force [229]\n\n\nSecurity, law enforcement and emergency services\nThanks to its location, Poland is a country essentially free from the threat of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes and tropical cyclones However, floods have occurred in low-lying areas from time to time during periods of extreme rainfall (e.g during the 2010 Central European floods).\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of 2023 [update], Poland's economy and gross domestic product (GDP) is the sixth largest in the European Union by nominal standards and the fifth largest by purchasing power parity It is also one of the fastest growing within the Union and reached a developed market status in 2018 [250] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat in 2023 amounted to 2.8%, which was the second-lowest in the EU [248] As of 2023 [update], around 62% of the employed population works in the service sector, 29% in manufacturing, and 8% in the agricultural sector [251] Although Poland is a member of the European single market, the country has not adopted the Euro as legal tender and maintains its own currency – the Polish złoty (zł, PLN).\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2020, the total value of the tourism industry in Poland was 104.3 billion PLN, then equivalent to 4.5% of the Polish GDP [261] Tourism contributes considerably to the overall economy and makes up a relatively large proportion of the country's service market [262] Nearly 200,000 people were employed in the accommodation and catering (hospitality) sector in 2020 [261] In 2021, Poland ranked 12th most visited country in the world by international arrivals [263]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of rail, road, marine shipping and air travel The country is part of EU's Schengen Area and is an important transport hub due to its strategic geographical position in Central Europe [268] Some of the longest European routes, including the E30 and E40, run through Poland The country has a good network of highways consisting of express roads and motorways As of August 2023, Poland has the world's 21st-largest road network, maintaining over 5,000 km (3,100 mi) of highways in use [269]\n\n\nEnergy\nThe electricity generation sector in Poland is largely fossil-fuel–based Coal production in Poland is a major source of employment and the largest source of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions [275] Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in the production of their energy The three largest Polish coal mining firms (Węglokoks, Kompania Węglowa and JSW) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually [276] After coal, Polish energy supply relies significantly on oil—the nation is the third-largest buyer of Russian oil exports to the EU [277]\n\n\nScience and technology\nOver the course of history, the Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics [280] Perhaps the most renowned Pole to support this theory was Nicolaus Copernicus (Mikołaj Kopernik), who triggered the Copernican Revolution by placing the Sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe [281] He also derived a quantity theory of money, which made him a pioneer of economics Copernicus' achievements and discoveries are considered the basis of Polish culture and cultural identity [282] Poland was ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [283]\n\n\nDemographics\nPoland has a population of approximately 38.2 million as of 2021, and is the ninth-most populous country in Europe, as well as the fifth-most populous member state of the European Union [285] It has a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometre (320 inhabitants/sq mi) [286] The total fertility rate was estimated at 1.33 children born to a woman in 2021, which is among the world's lowest [287] Furthermore, Poland's population is aging significantly, and the country has a median age of 42.2 [288]\n\n\nLanguages\nPolish is the official and predominant spoken language in Poland, and is one of the official languages of the European Union [304] It is also a second language in parts of neighbouring Lithuania, where it is taught in Polish-minority schools [305] [306] Contemporary Poland is a linguistically homogeneous nation, with 97% of respondents declaring Polish as their mother tongue [307] There are currently 15 minority languages in Poland, [308] including one recognised regional language, Kashubian, which is spoken by approximately 100,000 people on a daily basis in the northern regions of Kashubia and Pomerania [309] Poland also recognises secondary administrative languages or auxiliary languages in bilingual municipalities, where bilingual signs and placenames are commonplace [310] According to the Centre for Public Opinion Research, around 32% of Polish citizens declared knowledge of the English language in 2015 [311]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2021 census, 71.3% of all Polish citizens adhere to the Roman Catholic Church, with 6.9% identifying as having no religion and 20.6% refusing to answer [3]\n\n\nHealth\nMedical service providers and hospitals in Poland are subordinate to the Ministry of Health; it provides administrative oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice, and is obliged to maintain a high standard of hygiene and patient care Poland has a universal healthcare system based on an all-inclusive insurance system; state subsidised healthcare is available to all citizens covered by the general health insurance program of the National Health Fund (NFZ) Private medical complexes exist nationwide; over 50% of the population uses both public and private sectors [320] [321] [322]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Jagiellonian University founded in 1364 by Casimir III in Kraków was the first institution of higher learning established in Poland, and is one of the oldest universities still in continuous operation [327] Poland's Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej), established in 1773, was the world's first state ministry of education [328] [329] In 2018, the Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, placed Poland's educational output as one of the highest in the OECD, ranking 5th by student attainment and 6th by student performance in 2022 [330] The study showed that students in Poland perform better academically than in most OECD countries [331]\n\n\nEthnicity\nEthnic structure of Poland by voivodeship according to the censuses of 2002, 2011 and 2021: [339] [340] [341]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1,000-year history, and forms an important constituent in the Western civilisation [342] The Poles take great pride in their national identity which is often associated with the colours white and red, and exuded by the expression biało-czerwoni (\"whitereds\") [343] National symbols, chiefly the crowned white-tailed eagle, are often visible on clothing, insignia and emblems [344] The architectural monuments of great importance are protected by the National Heritage Board of Poland [345] Over 100 of the country's most significant tangible wonders were enlisted onto the Historic Monuments Register, [346] with further 17 being recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites [347]\n\n\nHolidays and traditions\nThere are 13 government-approved annual public holidays – New Year on 1 January, Three Kings' Day on 6 January, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, Labour Day on 1 May, Constitution Day on 3 May, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, Feast of the Assumption on 15 August, All Saints' Day on 1 November, Independence Day on 11 November and Christmastide on 25 and 26 December [348]\n\n\nMusic\nArtists from Poland, including famous musicians such as Frédéric Chopin, Artur Rubinstein, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Henryk Wieniawski, Karol Szymanowski, Witold Lutosławski, Stanisław Moniuszko and traditional, regionalised folk composers create a lively and diverse music scene, which even recognises its own music genres, such as sung poetry and disco polo [355]\n\n\nArt\nArt in Poland has invariably reflected European trends, with Polish painting pivoted on folklore, Catholic themes, historicism and realism, but also on Impressionism and romanticism An important art movement was Young Poland, developed in the late 19th century for promoting decadence, symbolism and Art Nouveau Since the 20th century Polish documentary art and photography has enjoyed worldwide fame, especially the Polish School of Posters [360] One of the most distinguished paintings in Poland is Lady with an Ermine (1490) by Leonardo da Vinci [361]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Poland reflects European architectural styles, with strong historical influences derived from Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries [364] Settlements founded on Magdeburg Law evolved around central marketplaces (plac, rynek), encircled by a grid or concentric network of streets forming an old town (stare miasto) [365] Poland's traditional landscape is characterised by ornate churches, city tenements and town halls [366] Cloth hall markets (sukiennice) were once an abundant feature of Polish urban architecture [367] The mountainous south is known for its Zakopane chalet style, which originated in Poland [368]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe literary works of Poland have traditionally concentrated around the themes of patriotism, spirituality, social allegories and moral narratives [379] The earliest examples of Polish literature, written in Latin, date to the 12th century [380] The first Polish phrase Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai (officially translated as \"Let me, I shall grind, and you take a rest\") was documented in the Book of Henryków and reflected the use of a quern-stone [381] It has been since included in UNESCO's Memory of World Register [382] The oldest extant manuscripts of fine prose in Old Polish are the Holy Cross Sermons and the Bible of Queen Sophia, [383] and Calendarium cracoviense (1474) is Poland's oldest surviving print [384]\n\n\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of Poland is eclectic and shares similarities with other regional cuisines Among the staple or regional dishes are pierogi (filled dumplings), kielbasa (sausage), bigos (hunter's stew), kotlet schabowy (breaded cutlet), gołąbki (cabbage rolls), barszcz (borscht), żurek (soured rye soup), oscypek (smoked cheese), and tomato soup [396] [397] Bagels, a type of bread roll, also originated in Poland [398]\n\n\nFashion and design\nSeveral Polish designers and stylists left a legacy of beauty inventions and cosmetics; including Helena Rubinstein and Maksymilian Faktorowicz, who created a line of cosmetics company in California known as Max Factor and formulated the term \"make-up\" which is now widely used as an alternative for describing cosmetics [406] Faktorowicz is also credited with inventing modern eyelash extensions [407] [408] As of 2020, Poland possesses the sixth-largest cosmetic market in Europe Inglot Cosmetics is the country's largest beauty products manufacturer, [409] and the retail store Reserved is the country's most successful clothing store chain [410]\n\n\nCinema\nThe cinema of Poland traces its origins to 1894, when inventor Kazimierz Prószyński patented the Pleograph and subsequently the Aeroscope, the first successful hand-held operated film camera [413] [414] In 1897, Jan Szczepanik constructed the Telectroscope, a prototype of television transmitting images and sounds [413] They are both recognised as pioneers of cinematography [413] Poland has also produced influential directors, film producers and actors, many of whom were active in Hollywood, chiefly Roman Polański, Andrzej Wajda, Pola Negri, Samuel Goldwyn, the Warner brothers, Max Fleischer, Agnieszka Holland, Krzysztof Zanussi and Krzysztof Kieślowski [415]\n\n\nMedia\nAccording to the Eurobarometer Report (2015), 78 percent of Poles watch the television daily [416] In 2020, 79 percent of the population read the news more than once a day, placing it second behind Sweden [417] Poland has a number of major domestic media outlets, chiefly the public broadcasting corporation TVP, free-to-air channels TVN and Polsat as well as 24-hour news channels TVP Info, TVN 24 and Polsat News [418] Public television extends its operations to genre-specific programmes such as TVP Sport, TVP Historia, TVP Kultura, TVP Rozrywka, TVP Seriale and TVP Polonia, the latter a state-run channel dedicated to the transmission of Polish-language telecasts for the Polish diaspora In 2020, the most popular types of newspapers were tabloids and socio-political news dailies [416]\n\n\nSports\nMotorcycle Speedway, volleyball and association football are among the country's most popular sports, with a rich history of international competitions [420] [421] Track and field, basketball, handball, boxing, MMA, ski jumping, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, tennis, fencing, swimming, and weightlifting are other popular sports.\nThe golden era of football in Poland occurred throughout the 1970s and went on until the early 1980s when the Polish national football team achieved their best results in any FIFA World Cup competitions finishing third place in the 1974 and the 1982 tournaments The team won a gold medal in football at the 1972 Summer Olympics and two silver medals, in 1976 and in 1992 In 2012, Poland co-hosted the UEFA European Football Championship [422]\n\n\nSee also\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20\n\n\nNotes\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20\n\n\nReferences\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52; 20\n\n\nWorks cited\n52°N 20°E﻿ / ﻿52°N 20°E﻿ / 52;

{"title": "The_Amazing_Spider-Man_(film)", "content": "\nPlot\nA young Peter Parker finds his father's home office burglarized Richard and Mary Parker, Peter's parents, gather hidden documents, take Peter to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and mysteriously leave.\n\n\nCast\nChris Zylka portrays Flash Thompson, a high school bully who is also the captain of the Midtown Science High basketball team and typically picks on Parker [46] On playing the role, Zylka said, \"You just try to focus As an artist or as an actor, you just try to focus and stay in that world and block it all out.\" [47] Embeth Davidtz portrays Peter's mother, Mary Parker [33] [34] Leif Gantvoort plays the burglar who robs the convenience store and then kills Uncle Ben, and Michael Barra plays T-Bone, the store clerk Tom Waite plays Nicky, a thug whom Peter mistakes for his uncle's killer Hannah Marks portrays Missy Kallenback, a shy girl who has a crush on Peter [48] Kelsey Chow's brief role is simply credited as \"Hot Girl\" during the end credits of the film, but the actress revealed to media outlets around the time of the film's release that her character is in fact Sally Avril [49] Similarly, C Thomas Howell's character is credited as \"Jack's Father\" at the end of the film (Jack being a boy that Spider-Man rescues on the Williamsburg Bridge) but he is referred to as Troy by one of his fellow construction workers in the film itself Unlike the previous films, J Jonah Jameson does not appear [50] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance, as he did in the previous films At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con, Lee detailed that he plays a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books, oblivious to the ongoing battle [51] Michael Massee, who previously worked with Marvel as Dr Bruce Banner in the Ultimate Avengers animated film series, plays the mysterious man in the shadows who talks with Connors in his prison cell in a teaser scene during the end credits [52] As to the man's identity, director Marc Webb said, \"It's intentionally mysterious And I invite speculation...\" [53] In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the character was revealed to be Gustav Fiers [54] Michael Papajohn, who played Dennis Carradine, Uncle Ben's apparent killer in the 2002 film, has a cameo as Alfred, Dr Ratha's limo driver, thus being the only actor (aside from Stan Lee) of the Sam Raimi films to play a role in the reboot film Papajohn originally asked to reprise the role as the robber, but the part was given to Gantvoort [55]\n\n\nProduction\nFollowing the release of Spider-Man 3 (2007), Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 6, 2011 release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had written several rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who co-wrote the second and third films, was working on yet another attempt [56] [57] Raimi wanted John Malkovich to play his next villain [56] However, on January 11, 2010, Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that rather than continue the earlier saga, they were rebooting the series with a new cast and crew Industry reports claimed that Raimi had admitted that he could not meet the scheduled release date and retain creative integrity [58] Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers [58]\n\n\nDevelopment\nFollowing the release of Spider-Man 3 (2007), Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 6, 2011 release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the

release date and retain creative integrity [58] Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers [58]\n\n\nCasting\nIn May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell, Alden Ehrenreich, Frank Dillane, Andrew Garfield and Josh Hutcherson [70] In June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin [71] At least Bell, Ehrenreich, Garfield, Yelchin, Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests [72] Joe Jonas also auditioned [73] On July 1, 2010, the choice of Garfield was confirmed [74] Webb stated that he felt he knew Garfield was the right choice when they were filming a cutscene where he was eating a cheeseburger while telling Gwen to calm down [75] Garfield said that he got the role after he decided to pretend he was auditioning for a Spider-Man short film with friends to ease off the pressure [76]\n\n\nDesign\nWebb felt a responsibility to reinvent Spider-Man [63] One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics [90] Costume Designer Kym Barrett was brought onto the project and worked closely with Webb to redesign the costume with realism in mind The new iteration of the iconic suit featured golden eye lenses made from sunglasses The soles of the shoes were made from cut off asics running shoes that were painted to match the pattern of the costume The web shooters and the civilian wrist bands Peter wears in the film are made from everyday wristwatch parts The costume also features a fully screen printed hex pattern to make it resemble athletic wear In February 2011, with the launch of the official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed [91] [92] Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and noted \"the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands as one of the great comic-book costumes ever.\" [93] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine [94] Webb explained that he felt that \"the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect\" Webb paid attention to the question of \"How would a kid make it?\" and then took some license with it About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew \"wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider  [symbol on the chest] were something we used to emphasize that.\" He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions They made the webbing on the costume a little darker [90] Webb stated that \"With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made\" [90] Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body [95]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles [102] [103] The working title was Fiona's Tale [104] The 90-day shoot included two weeks in New York City, while the bulk of filming occurred in and around Los Angeles, including such locations as the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood, St John Bosco High School's Gym, Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Mid-Wilshire, and various locations around South Pasadena, San Pedro and Woodland Hills [105] Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer explained, \" [T]here is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope on your own backlot .. Basing the film on the lot also makes it easier for producers to interact with Sony's in-house visual effects team, and gives the studios greater control of quality and security.\" [105]\n\n\nStunts\nWebb stated that he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more grounded physically, a challenge for a superhuman character [63] The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, [63] Vic [112] and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member [113] [114] Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director [107] To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar [115] Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, \"he swings down at the same speed as he swings up,\" and this \"constant\" speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where \"he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again.\" [116] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film [117] While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an \"incredible wealth of acrobatics\" [114] These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design [107] According to Andy, operating the rigs \"was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering.\" [116] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated [63] Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts [118] Arad explained that \"Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible.\" [119]\n\n\nEffects\nThe company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California, produced some of the equipment [120] [121] The film was reported to be the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig [122] 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion [120] Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: \"Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view – so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets.\" [114] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they \"started making the movie around the time Avatar came out\" which made every studio want 3D This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films [68] [123] Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film [42]\n\n\nMusic\nJames Horner scored the film [127] Webb described Horner's first musical cue as \"spectacular\" Webb said, \"I wanted to create a score that felt massive and huge but also intimate and small.\" [128] Webb admitted that Horner had the score \"nailed in an hour and a half\" The film also features the Coldplay song \"'Til Kingdom Come\" from the album X&Y [129] In May 2012, Sony Classical revealed details about the soundtrack [130] Critics like Filmtracks.com's Christian Clemmensen felt that Horner's approach to writing the score for The Amazing Spider-Man is \"remarkably intelligent\" and that \"Horner's mix of the electronic elements into the major ensemble cues is tastefully handled\" Clemmensen also felt that the piano is \"the heart of the score, following Parker's relationships in their tender and mysterious turns\" [131]\n\n\nMarketing\nSpider-Man and Lizard PEZ dispensers were revealed at the November 2011 Comic-Con first depicted the film's Lizard [132] In December 2011, it was revealed that Mega Brands had the rights to produce construction sets [133] [134] A Marvel Select Spider-Man action figure by Diamond Select Toys was announced in January 2012—the fifth Marvel Select Spider-Man figure, but the first based on a film [135] The first look at a Hasbro action figure of the film's version of Spider-Man was revealed at the July 2011 Comic-Con [136] Hasbro made a radio control speed-climbing figure [137] Minimates made action figures from the film [138] Other companies releasing action figures for the film include Hot Toys, MediCom and Kaiyodo [139] OPI Products released a collection of The Amazing Spider-Man nail polish [140] Trading cards were also available [141]\n\n\nMerchandising\nSpider-Man

Trading cards were also available [141]\n\n\nPreviews\nA teaser trailer was leaked on the Internet and aired at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2011, attached to the superhero film Captain America: The First Avenger [152] Rob Keyes of Screen Rant felt that \"it takes on a noticeably different tone from that of Raimi trilogy of Spider-Man movies, and presents itself in a similar fashion to what Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins.\" [153] Some writers observed that the trailer very closely resembles the 2008 video game Mirror's Edge [154] [155] [156] After the third trailer was released, Webb defended the point of view footage, saying it was an early rendering and that the CGI was still in production [42]\n\n\nViral campaign\nThe main viral marketing site was revealed in the second trailer in February 2012 [165] The official Twitter account revealed a scavenger hunt by posting \"Property of Peter Parker.. Lost\" with the longitude and latitude coordinates of direct markets in major US cities The missing items included a JanSport backpack One of the clues hidden in the backpack was a link to a page on the viral site that unlocked countdown timers for the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona [180] [181] Once the countdown was up, each of the city-specific Twitter accounts for the marketing campaign sent out five locations in each city A person at each spot waited to give the first person with the password a package and the tag-name \"operative\" [182] These operatives painted the Spider-Man logo as graffiti [183] The operatives then could view a scene related to the film [184] The main viral website revealed hints to other

Ben, and mysteriously leave.\n\n\nCast\nChris Zylka portrays Flash Thompson, a high school bully who is also the captain of the Midtown Science High basketball team and typically picks on Parker [46] On playing the role, Zylka said, \"You just try to focus As an artist or as an actor, you just try to focus and stay in that world and block it all out.\" [47] Embeth Davidtz portrays Peter's mother,

the film, but the actress revealed to media outlets around the time of the film's release that her character is in fact Sally Avril [49] Similarly, C Thomas Howell's character is credited as \"Jack's Father\" at the end of the film (Jack being a boy that Spider-Man rescues on the Williamsburg Bridge) but he is referred to as Troy by one of his fellow construction workers in the film itself Unlike the previous films, J Jonah Jameson does not appear [50] Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance, as he did in the previous films At the 2011 Dallas Comic Con, Lee detailed that he plays a librarian listening to music on his headphones while stamping books, oblivious to the ongoing battle [51] Michael Massee, who previously worked with Marvel as Dr Bruce Banner in the Ultimate Avengers animated film series, plays the mysterious man in the shadows who talks with Connors in his prison cell in a teaser scene during the end credits [52] As to the man's identity, director Marc Webb said, \"It's intentionally mysterious And I invite speculation...\" [53] In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the character was revealed to be Gustav Fiers [54] Michael Papajohn, who played Dennis Carradine, Uncle Ben's apparent killer in the 2002 film, has a cameo as Alfred, Dr Ratha's limo driver, thus being the only actor (aside from Stan Lee) of the Sam Raimi films to play a role in the reboot film Papajohn originally asked to reprise the role as the robber, but the part was given to Gantvoort [55]\n\n\nProduction\nFollowing the release of Spider-Man 3 (2007), Sony Pictures Entertainment had announced a May 6, 2011 release date for Sam Raimi's next film in the earlier series By this time, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross had written several rejected versions of a script and Ziskin's husband Alvin Sargent, who co-wrote the second and third films, was working on yet another attempt [56] [57] Raimi wanted John Malkovich to play his

creative integrity [58] Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Ziskin continued as producers [58]\n\n\nCasting\nIn May 2010, The Hollywood Reporter said the actors who met with Webb to be considered for the lead role included Jamie Bell, Alden Ehrenreich, Frank Dillane, Andrew Garfield and Josh Hutcherson [70] In June 2010 the Los Angeles Times reported that the shortlist had expanded to include Aaron Johnson and Anton Yelchin [71] At least Bell, Ehrenreich, Garfield, Yelchin, Logan Lerman and Michael Angarano had screen tests [72] Joe Jonas also auditioned [73] On July 1, 2010, the choice of Garfield was confirmed [74] Webb stated that he felt he knew Garfield was the right choice when they were filming a cutscene where he was eating a cheeseburger while telling Gwen to calm down [75] Garfield said that he got the role after he decided to pretend he was auditioning for a Spider-Man short film with friends to ease off the pressure [76]\n\n\nDesign\nWebb felt a responsibility to reinvent Spider-Man [63] One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics [90] Costume Designer Kym Barrett was brought onto the project and worked closely with Webb to redesign the costume with realism in mind The new iteration of the iconic suit featured golden eye lenses made from sunglasses The soles of the shoes were made from cut off asics running shoes that were painted to match the pattern of the costume The web shooters and the civilian wrist bands Peter wears in the film are made from everyday wristwatch parts The costume also features a fully screen printed hex pattern to make it resemble athletic wear In February 2011, with the launch of the official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed [91] [92] Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and noted \"the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands as one of the great comic-book costumes ever.\" [93] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine [94] Webb explained that he felt that \"the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect\" Webb paid attention to the question of \"How would a kid make it?\" and then took some license with it About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew \"wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider  [symbol on the chest] were something we used to emphasize that.\" He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions They made the webbing on the costume a little darker [90] Webb stated that \"With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made\" [90] Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body [95]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on December 6, 2010, in Los Angeles [102] [103] The working title was Fiona's Tale [104] The 90-day shoot included two weeks in New York City, while the bulk of filming occurred in and around Los Angeles, including such locations as the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood, St John Bosco High School's Gym, Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Mid-Wilshire, and various locations around South Pasadena, San Pedro and Woodland Hills [105] Sony Entertainment spokesman Steve Elzer explained, \" [T]here is a comfort level in producing a project of this size and scope on your own backlot .. Basing the film on the lot also makes it easier for producers to interact with Sony's in-house visual effects team, and gives the studios greater control of quality and security.\" [105]\n\n\nStunts\nWebb stated that he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more grounded physically, a challenge for a superhuman character [63] The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, [63] Vic [112] and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member [113] [114] Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director [107] To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar [115] Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, \"he swings down at the same speed as he swings up,\" and this \"constant\" speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where \"he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again.\" [116] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film [117] While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an \"incredible wealth of acrobatics\" [114] These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design [107] According to Andy, operating the rigs \"was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering.\" [116] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated [63] Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts [118] Arad explained that \"Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible.\" [119]\n\n\nEffects\nThe company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California, produced some of the equipment [120] [121] The film was reported to be the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig [122] 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion [120] Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: \"Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view – so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets.\" [114] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they \"started making the movie around the time Avatar came out\" which made every studio want 3D This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films [68] [123] Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film [42]\n\n\nMusic\nJames Horner scored the film [127] Webb described Horner's first musical cue as \"spectacular\" Webb said, \"I wanted to create a score that felt massive and huge but also intimate and small.\" [128] Webb admitted that Horner had the score \"nailed in an hour and a half\" The film also features the Coldplay song \"'Til Kingdom Come\" from the album X&Y [129] In May 2012, Sony Classical revealed details about the soundtrack [130] Critics like Filmtracks.com's Christian Clemmensen felt that Horner's approach to writing the score for The Amazing Spider-Man is \"remarkably intelligent\" and that \"Horner's mix of the electronic elements into the major ensemble cues is tastefully handled\" Clemmensen also felt that the piano is \"the heart of the score, following Parker's relationships in their tender and mysterious turns\" [131]\n\n\nMarketing\nSpider-Man and Lizard PEZ dispensers were revealed at the November 2011 Comic-Con

Christopher Nolan did with Batman Begins.\" [153] Some writers observed that the trailer very closely resembles the 2008 video game Mirror's Edge [154] [155] [156] After the third trailer was released, Webb defended the point of view footage, saying it was an early rendering and that the CGI was still in production [42]\n\n\nViral campaign\nThe main viral marketing site was revealed in the second trailer in February 2012 [165] The official Twitter account revealed a scavenger hunt by posting \"Property of Peter Parker..

the viral site that unlocked countdown timers for the cities of Los Angeles, New York City, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle and Phoenix, Arizona [180] [181] Once the countdown was up, each of the city-specific Twitter accounts for the marketing campaign sent out five locations in each city A person at each spot waited to give the first person with the password a package and the tag-name \"operative\" [182] These operatives painted the Spider-Man logo as graffiti [183] The operatives then could view a scene related to the film [184] The main viral website revealed hints to other websites, such as a photo blog that expressed Peter Parker's point of view [185] [186] An unlocked puzzle there revealed the words \"evolve\", \"through\" and \"engineering\" which when put together led to another website with design sketches on how to build a web-shooter [186] [187] [188]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nT-shirts depicting the film's Spider-Man to help the cause for Stand Up to Cancer were

Born in Aïn Sidi Ali, Laghouat Province, Khelif moved to Biban Mesbah, a rural village in Tiaret Province, at a young age, where she would grow up and develop her passion for boxing.\n\n**Early Life**\nKhelif was born in Aïn Sidi Ali, Laghouat Province, when her family was still living in the area. However, when she was just two months old, her family made the move to Biban Mesbah, a rural village in Tiaret Province, where she would spend most of her childhood and adolescence. Growing up in a small village, Khelif was exposed to the harsh realities of rural life, but it was also this environment that would shape her into the determined and resilient individual she is today.\n\n**Career**\nKhelif's journey in professional boxing began with her participation in several international competitions. At the 2018 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships, Khelif finished 17th in the women's lightweight event after being eliminated in the first round by Karina Ibragimova. This experience was a valuable learning curve for Khelif, as she gained crucial experience and knowledge of the sport.\n\nIn the following year, Khelif participated in the 2019 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships, where she finished 33rd in the women's lightweight event. Despite being eliminated in the first round by Natalia Shadrina, Khelif continued to demonstrate her growth and improvement as a boxer.\n\n**2018–2021: Career Beginnings and Olympic Debut**\nKhelif's early years in professional boxing were marked by her participation in several international competitions. At the 2018 AIBA Women's World Boxing Championships, Khelif finished 17th in the women's lightweight event after being eliminated in the first round by Karina Ibragimova.

The disqualification came amid allegations from the Russian-led International Boxing Association's (IBA) that Khelif had failed unspecified eligibility tests.\n\nThis disqualification happened three days after Khelif defeated Azalia Amineva, a previously unbeaten Russian prospect. The disqualification restored Amineva's undefeated record, causing widespread controversy and debate among boxing fans and experts.\n\nAccording to the Algerian Olympic Committee, Khelif was disqualified for medical reasons. However, this explanation was disputed by the IBA, which maintained that Khelif had failed the eligibility tests. The incident left many questioning the fairness and integrity of the IBA and the decision-making process.\n\n**2024: Olympic Gold Medal**\nIn January 2024, Khelif became a UNICEF national ambassador, marking a significant milestone in her career.

However, in the 46th second of the match, Carini withdrew after receiving two blows, citing intense pain in her nose. Carini reportedly exclaimed, \"It's not fair!\" after a punch from Khelif, causing widespread controversy and debate among boxing fans and experts.\n\nKhelif's victory in the second round marked a significant milestone in her career, as she continued to demonstrate her skill and determination in the face of competition.

{"title": "2021_Myanmar_coup_d'état", "content": "\nBackground\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, has been beset with political instability since it was granted independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948 Between 1958 and 1960, the military formed a temporary caretaker government at the behest of U Nu, the country's democratically elected prime minister, to resolve political infighting [37] The military voluntarily restored civilian government after holding the 1960 Burmese general election [38] Less than two years later, the military seized power in the 1962 coup, which under the leadership of General Ne Win, precipitated 26 years of military rule [39]\n\n\nUnfolding of the coup\nOn 1 February 2021, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said that Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, Han Tha Myint, and other party leaders had been \"taken\" in an early morning raid Myo Nyunt added that he expected to be also detained shortly Numerous communications channels stopped working – phone lines to the capital, Naypyidaw, were interrupted, state-run MRTV said it was unable to broadcast due to \"technical issues\", [47] and widespread Internet disruptions were reported beginning around 3 a.m [48] The military disrupted cellular services throughout the country, mirroring \"kill switch\" tactics previously employed in combat zones in Chin and Rakhine states [49] All the member banks under the Myanmar Banking Association suspended their financial services [50]\n\n\nFebruary\nOn 1 February 2021, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said that Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, Han Tha Myint, and other party

disrupted cellular services throughout the country, mirroring \"kill switch\" tactics previously employed in combat zones in Chin and Rakhine states [49] All the member banks under the Myanmar Banking Association suspended their financial services [50]\n\n\nLater developments\nOn 8 March 2021, state-controlled channel MRTV announced that the Ministry of Information revoked the licences for five local media outlets: Mizzima, Myanmar Now, DVB, 7 Day News, and Khit Thit Media The announcement stated that the outlets were prohibited from publishing and broadcasting in any type of media and by using any sort of technology [85]\n\n\nMotives\nThe military's motives for the coup remain unclear Ostensibly, the military has posited that alleged voter fraud threatened national sovereignty [90] A few days before the coup, the civilian-appointed Union Election Commission had categorically rejected the military's claims of voter fraud, citing the lack of evidence to support the military's claims of 8.6 million irregularities in voter lists across Myanmar's 314 townships [91]\n\n\nIMF aid\nA few days before the coup, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had released US$372 million in cash loans to the Central Bank of Myanmar, as part of an emergency aid package, to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [99] The funds came with no conditions, and without any precedent for refunds [99] In response to potential concerns regarding proper use of the funds by the military regime, an IMF spokesperson stated \"It would be in the interests of the government, and certainly the people of Myanmar that those funds are indeed used accordingly.\" [100] The IMF did not directly address any concerns regarding the independence of the Central Bank, given the military's appointment of Than Nyein, an ally, as governor [100] [101] On 16 September, the IMF acknowledged it was unable to ascertain whether the military regime was using the funds as intended (i.e., \"to tackle COVID and support the most vulnerable people.\") [102] Myanmar's Ministry of Planning and Finance did not respond to a request for comment on how funds had been appropriated [102]\n\n\nGeopolitical considerations\nChina is depicted in Western media as having hegemony over Myanmar [104] [105] [106] China and Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the coup [107] China and Russia are reportedly the main suppliers of weapons to the Myanmar Army [108] Chinese foreign direct investment in Myanmar totalled $19 billion in 2019, compared with $700 million from the EU [108] The Financial Times argues that Russia is supportive of the junta in order to sell more arms to them [109]\n\n\nLegal basis\nThe legality of the coup has been questioned by legal scholars, including Melissa Crouch [116] The International Commission of Jurists found that, by staging a coup, the military had violated Myanmar's constitution, since the alleged election irregularities did not justify the declaration of a state of emergency in comport with the Constitution Further, the jurists found that the military's actions had violated the fundamental rule of law principle [117] The NLD has also rejected the legal basis for the military takeover [118] [119]\n\n\nReactions\nCivil resistance efforts have emerged within the country, in opposition to the coup, in numerous forms, including acts of civil disobedience, labour strikes, a military boycott campaign, a pot-banging movement, a red ribbon campaign, public protests, and formal recognition of the election results by elected representatives The three-finger salute has been widely adopted as a protest symbol, [126] while netizens joined the Milk Tea Alliance, an online democratic solidarity movement in Asia [127] \"Kabar Ma Kyay Bu\" (ကမ္ဘာမကျေဘူး), a song that was first popularised as the anthem of the 8888 Uprising, has been revitalised by the civil disobedience movement as a protest song

a protest song [128]\n\n\nActivities on social media and Internet blackout\nFacebook had been used to organise the civil disobedience campaign's labour strikes and the emerging boycott movement [157] On 4 February, telecom operators and internet providers across Myanmar were ordered to block Facebook until 7 February, to ensure the \"country's stability.\" [157] MPT, a state-owned carrier, also blocked Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp services, while Telenor Myanmar blocked only Facebook [158] [157]  Following the Facebook ban, Burmese users had begun flocking to Twitter, popularising hashtags like #RespectOurVotes, #HearTheVoiceofMyanmar, and #SaveMyanmar [159] On 5 February, the government extended the social media access ban to include Instagram and Twitter [160] [161] On the morning of 6 February, the military authorities initiated an internet outage nationwide [162] Internet access was restricted by the government again since 14 February 2021 for 20 days, from 1:00 am to 9:00 am [163] [164] [165] [166] People have used social media like Facebook and Twitter to reach their voices to international communities and also to share photo and video evidence of brutality of military forces on the protestors [166]\n\n\nReligious response\nVarious Buddhist monasteries and educational institutions have denounced the coup, [167] among them the Masoyein and Mahāgandhārāma monasteries [168] [169] Sitagu International Buddhist Academy also released a statement imploring against actions that run counter to the Dhamma [170] Aside from the Buddhist saṅgha, local clergy and monastics of the Catholic Church have similarly voiced their opposition to the military takeover [171]\n\n\nCommercial reactions\nThailand's largest industrial estate developer, Amata, halted a $1 billion industrial zone development project in Yangon in response to the coup, having started construction in December 2020 [173] [174] Suzuki Motor, Myanmar's largest automaker, and several manufacturers [vague] halted domestic operations in the wake of the coup [173] The Yangon Stock Exchange has also suspended trading since 1 February [173] Myanmar's real estate market crashed as a result of the coup, with sales and purchase transactions dropping by almost 100% [175]\n\n\nDefections\nAs the protests have started, there have been reported defections from the Myanmar Police Force On 5 March 2021, 11 officers were seen to have crossed the India–Myanmar land border to Mizoram state [193] with their families [194] [195] [196] due to refusing orders to engage protestors by using lethal force [197] Myanmar officials have reached out to India to repatriate the defecting police officers located in Mizoram, with the reply that the Indian government will make a final decision [198] The Assam Rifles were given orders to tighten security along the India–Myanmar border [199] As of 5 March 2021, more than 600 police officers have joined the anti-regime movement,

Burmese coup, was a military coup that occurred in Myanmar on 1 February 2021, when the military seized power from the democratically elected government. The coup was led by the Tatmadaw, the armed forces of Myanmar, who declared a one-year state of emergency and detained several high-ranking officials, including Aung San Suu Kyi, the State Counsellor of Myanmar, and Win Myint, the President of Myanmar.\n\n**Background**\n\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, has been beset with political instability since it was granted independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948. The country has a long history of military rule, with the military seizing power in 1962 and maintaining control for 26 years. In 2011, the military began to transition power to a civilian government, with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) winning a landslide victory in the 2015 general election.\n\nHowever, the military maintained significant influence over the government and was able to block several key reforms, including the reform of the military-drafted constitution. In the 2020 general election, the NLD won a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, but the military claimed that the election was marred by voter fraud and threatened to take action.\n\n**Unfolding of the Coup**\n\nOn 1 February 2021, the Tatmadaw launched a military coup, with troops and police surrounding government buildings and key infrastructure in the capital city of Naypyidaw. The military declared a one-year state of emergency and detained several high-ranking officials, including Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, and Han Tha Myint, the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe military also suspended the constitution and took control of the government, with Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw, assuming the role of chairman of the State Administration Council. The military claimed that the coup was necessary to prevent further instability and chaos in the country.\n\n**February**\n\nThe military disrupted cellular services throughout the country, mirroring \"kill switch\" tactics previously employed in combat zones in Chin and Rakhine states. All the member banks under the Myanmar Banking Association suspended their financial services, and the state-run MRTV was unable to broadcast due to \"technical issues\".\n\nOn 8 March 2021, state-controlled channel MRTV announced that the Ministry of Information revoked the licences for five local media outlets: Mizzima, Myanmar Now, DVB, 7 Day News, and Khit Thit Media.

Further, the jurists found that the military's actions had violated the fundamental rule of law principle.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nCivil resistance efforts have emerged within the country, in opposition to the coup, in numerous forms, including acts of civil disobedience, labour strikes, a military boycott campaign, a pot-banging movement, a red ribbon campaign, public protests, and formal recognition of the election results by elected representatives.\n\nThe three-finger salute has been widely adopted as a protest symbol, while netizens joined the Milk Tea Alliance, an online democratic solidarity movement in Asia. \"Kabar Ma Kyay Bu\" (ကမ္ဘာမကျေဘူး), a song that was first popularised as the anthem of the 8888 Uprising, has been revitalised by the civil disobedience movement as a protest song.\n\n**Domestic**\n\nCivil resistance efforts have emerged within the country, in opposition to the coup, in numerous forms, including acts of civil disobedience, labour strikes, a military boycott campaign, a pot-banging movement, a red ribbon campaign, public protests, and formal recognition of the election results by elected representatives.\n\nThe three-finger salute has been widely adopted as a protest symbol, while netizens joined the Milk Tea Alliance, an online democratic solidarity movement in Asia. \"Kabar Ma Kyay Bu\" (ကမ္ဘာမကျေဘူး), a song that was first popularised as the anthem of the 8888 Uprising, has been revitalised by the civil disobedience movement as a protest song.\n\n**Activities on Social Media and Internet Blackout**\n\nFacebook had been used to organise the civil disobedience campaign's labour strikes and the emerging boycott movement.

Suzuki Motor, Myanmar's largest automaker, and several manufacturers halted domestic operations in the wake of the coup.\n\n**Defections**\n\nAs the protests have started, there have been reported defections from the Myanmar Police Force. On 5 March 2021, 11 officers were seen to have crossed the India–Myanmar land border to Mizoram state with their families. Myanmar officials have reached out to India to repatriate the defecting police officers located in Mizoram, with the reply that the Indian government will make a final decision.\n\n**International**\n\nMany countries, including Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Singapore, encouraged dialogue between the

\"2021_Myanmar_coup_d'état\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, has been beset with political instability since it was granted independence from the United Kingdom in January 1948 Between 1958 and 1960, the military formed a temporary caretaker government at the behest of U Nu, the country's democratically elected prime minister, to resolve political infighting [37] The military voluntarily restored civilian government after holding the 1960 Burmese general election [38] Less than two years later, the military seized power in the 1962 coup, which under the leadership of General Ne Win, precipitated 26 years of military rule [39]\n\n\nUnfolding of the coup\nOn 1 February 2021, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said that Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, Han Tha Myint, and other party leaders had been \"taken\" in an early morning raid Myo Nyunt added that he expected to be also detained shortly Numerous communications channels stopped working – phone lines to the capital, Naypyidaw, were interrupted, state-run MRTV said it was unable to broadcast due to \"technical issues\", [47] and widespread Internet disruptions were reported beginning around 3 a.m [48] The military disrupted cellular services throughout the country, mirroring \"kill switch\" tactics previously employed in combat zones in Chin and Rakhine states [49] All the member banks under the Myanmar Banking Association suspended their financial services [50]\n\n\nFebruary\nOn 1 February 2021, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said that Aung San Suu Kyi, Win Myint, Han Tha Myint, and other party

Association suspended their financial services [50]\n\n\nLater developments\nOn 8 March 2021, state-controlled channel MRTV announced that the Ministry of Information revoked the licences for five

using any sort of technology [85]\n\n\nMotives\nThe military's motives for the coup remain unclear Ostensibly, the military has posited that alleged voter fraud threatened national sovereignty [90] A few days before the coup, the civilian-appointed Union Election Commission had categorically rejected the military's claims of voter fraud, citing the lack of evidence to support the military's claims of 8.6 million irregularities in voter lists across Myanmar's 314 townships [91]\n\n\nIMF aid\nA few days before the coup, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had released US$372 million in cash loans to the Central Bank of Myanmar, as part of an emergency aid package, to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [99] The funds came with no conditions, and without any precedent for refunds [99] In response to potential concerns regarding proper use of the funds by the military regime, an IMF spokesperson stated \"It would be in the interests of the government, and certainly the people of Myanmar that those funds are indeed used accordingly.\" [100] The IMF did not directly address any concerns regarding the independence of the Central Bank, given the military's appointment of Than Nyein, an ally, as governor [100] [101] On 16 September, the IMF acknowledged it was unable to ascertain whether the military regime was using the funds as intended (i.e., \"to tackle COVID and support the most vulnerable people.\") [102] Myanmar's Ministry of Planning and Finance did not respond to a request for comment on how funds had been appropriated [102]\n\n\nGeopolitical considerations\nChina is depicted in Western media as having hegemony over Myanmar [104] [105] [106] China and Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the coup [107] China and Russia are reportedly the main suppliers of weapons to the Myanmar Army [108] Chinese foreign direct investment in Myanmar totalled $19 billion in 2019, compared with $700 million from the EU [108] The Financial Times argues that Russia is supportive of the junta in order to sell more arms to them [109]\n\n\nLegal basis\nThe legality of the coup has been questioned by legal scholars,

similar concerns led other major sports leagues, including the NBA, NHL, MLS, MLB, MLR seasons and NCAA to suspend or cancel games [62] The announcement came after a Seattle Dragons player, who self-reported symptoms to his team's medical staff, had been tested for coronavirus but had not yet received his results (the unnamed player eventually tested positive) [63] Although teams only played five games, the league announced it would pay all players their base salary for the rest of the season; players who received legitimate offers from the NFL or Canadian Football League (CFL) would be allowed to sign with those teams but with a clause requiring them to return to their XFL teams if the league were able to hold its championship game [64] At the time, the league still planned on having a 2021 season; it was exploring relocating as many as three of its teams, with the league contacting authorities in San Antonio, Texas, in early April about potentially placing a franchise there [65] Other potential 2021 actions included moving the Tampa Bay Vipers to Orlando and the New York Guardians to a smaller New Jersey stadium, Red Bull Arena [66]\n\n\nSale and relaunch\nOn August 3, 2020, it was reported that a consortium led by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Gerry Cardinale (through Cardinale's fund RedBird Capital Partners) purchased the XFL for $15 million just hours before an auction could take place; the purchase received court approval on August 7, 2020 [8] [9] The XFL's parent company originally listed the league with assets and liabilities in the range of $10 million to $50 million [61] [80] Johnson, who previously worked for McMahon as WWE wrestler The Rock, played collegiate football with the Miami Hurricanes in the 1990s and as a professional with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League; he and Garcia were married from 1997 to 2007 and have remained business partners since their divorce Cardinale's previous investments included the New York Yankees' side projects (such as YES Network and Legends Hospitality) and Suddenlink Communications [81] On August 21, 2020, the transition of ownership was completed, with Johnson stating \"The deal is officially closed and 'the keys' to the XFL have been handed over.\" [82] On October 1, 2020, the XFL announced its return in spring 2022 [83] Johnson and Garcia both stated that they would rescind the policy forbidding kneeling during the national anthem and would instead openly support and encourage such behavior in an October 14 interview with Vice [84]\n\n\nCFL merger talks\nOn March 10, 2021, it was announced that the XFL and CFL had entered into formal talks ahead of \"opportunities for the leagues to collaborate, innovate, and grow the game of football\" According to XFL President & CEO Jeffrey Pollack, the league had decided to hit the pause button on their planned 2022 season, so they could focus on talks with the CFL Both sides have declined to rule out any particular outcome from their talks which could have theoretically included a merger or acquisition [85] [86] On July 7, 2021, both leagues ended the discussions with no agreement; in the same statement, the XFL cancelled its 2022 season, intending to return in \"Spring 2023\" [87]\n\n\n2023 season\nThe XFL's second return to play began with a game between the Vegas Vipers and Arlington Renegades on Saturday, February 18, 2023 [247] The first week of games received tentative praise, with Bill Shea of The Athletic grading the return a B− in an article titled, \"I watched the XFL 3.0 so you don't have to (but you should!): The key takeaways.\" [248] However, TV ratings declined in comparison to the XFL's 2020 debut 1.54 million people watched the first game in 2023, down from the 3.3 million who watched the first game aired on ABC in 2020 [249] Week 2's ratings again lagged as the games were the first to not air on broadcast television [250]\n\n\nXFL–USFL merger\nOn March 27, 2023, Garcia said in a USA Today interview that XFL started planning for the 2024 season and declared: \"absolutely, there will be a 2024 XFL football season.\" [112]\n\n\nTeams\nOn July 25, 2022, Johnson and Garcia held a XFL Townhall at Texas Live! in Arlington where they confirmed all 2020 XFL markets except Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and New York would return Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and New York would be replaced by teams in San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Orlando respectively [122] [123]\n\n\nTimeline\n\" * \" indicates Championship Season\nDeactivated Teams in grey\n\n\nRule changes\nThe XFL ran test games with community colleges in Mississippi, Your Call Football, and The Spring League during their spring 2019 seasons, to experiment with rule changes It hired Dean Blandino as its head of officiating [126] [127] On December 7, 2022, the league confirmed it would be keeping the rulebook used in 2020 [128]\n\n\nKickoffs\nThe league has an active interest in reviving the kickoffs as an element of the game, in contrast to the former AAF, which eliminated kickoffs outright, and the NFL and college football, both of which imposed rules minimizing the impact of the kickoff in the mid-2010s to improve player safety [129] Many of these kickoff rules were adapted from rules created by The Spring League's predecessor, the Fall Experimental Football League: [130]\n\n\nPunts\nThe conventional extra point kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt two points, and a ten-yard attempt three points [136] (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs The Stars Football League also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score  In the event of a defensive penalty during the conversion attempt, the defense is penalized half the distance to the goal but the value of the attempt remains the same as it was prior to the penalty being enforced.\n\n\nPoints after touchdown\nThe conventional extra point kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt two points, and a ten-yard attempt three points [136] (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs The Stars Football League also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score  In the event of a defensive penalty during the conversion attempt, the defense is penalized half the distance to the goal but the value of the attempt remains the same as it was prior to the penalty being enforced.\n\n\nDouble-forward pass\nTeams can attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass This also means that if a pass is batted back towards the quarterback, he is eligible to throw it again; Landry Jones of Dallas successfully utilized this rule in a game.\n\n\nFumbles into the defensive end zone\nBeginning in 2023, if an offensive player fumbles the ball from outside the end zone and it goes through the end zone without being recovered, the offense retains possession at the point of the fumble (if the fumble occurred on fourth down, final possession is determined by whether the ball carrier reached the line to gain before the fumble), consistent with the rule for other forward fumbles At most other levels (except the USFL, which adopted the same rule at the same time), the team on offense loses possession of the ball and the opponent is awarded possession at its own 20-yard line [137]\n\n\nOvertime\nOvertime is decided by a three-round shootout of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the NCAA adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the 2019 FBS season [138] [139] Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball The defense is not able to score, as should a turnover occur, the play would be dead [132] Defensive penalties result in the ball moving up to the 1-yard line, while any subsequent defensive penalty on any play, even in future rounds, result in a score awarded to the offensive team Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted under regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score If both teams remain tied after three rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw [132]

[250]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The XFL (2020)\n\nThe XFL is a professional American football league that began play in 2020, with plans to return in 2023. The league was founded by Vince McMahon, the owner of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), also known as WWE. The XFL was designed to be a competitor to the National Football League (NFL), with a focus on a more exciting and fast-paced game.\n\n## History\n\nThe original XFL ran for a single season in 2001 as a joint venture between the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and NBC spearheaded by Vince McMahon and NBC executive Dick Ebersol. The league attempted to be a competitor to the National Football League (NFL), running during the late winter and early spring to take advantage of lingering desire for football after the end of the NFL season. It featured various modifications to the rules of football in order to increase its intensity, as well as on-air innovations such as Skycams, placing microphones on players, and in-game interviews with players. The league was criticized for relying too heavily on \"sports entertainment\" gimmicks similar to professional wrestling. Despite strong ratings for its first games, viewership eventually nosedived, and the league folded after the conclusion of the inaugural season.\n\n## Rebuild\n\nIn the 2017 ESPN 30 for 30 documentary This Was the XFL, McMahon openly mused about reviving the XFL, noting that changes would need to be made compared to 2001 to make it viable and relevant in the modern era. McMahon had purchased the trademarks of the defunct United Football League (UFL) and an alternative brand, \"UrFL\" (Your Football League), in early 2017. The following year, the director of the documentary, Charlie Ebersol (son of Dick Ebersol), would go on to help form the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2018, hoping to beat the revived XFL in being the first to play.\n\n## Mid-season cancellation\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the league canceled the remainder of its regular-season games over concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic; similar concerns led other major sports leagues, including the NBA, NHL, MLS, MLB, and NCAA, to suspend or cancel games. The announcement came after a Seattle Dragons player, who self-reported symptoms to his team's medical staff, had been tested for coronavirus but had not yet received his results (the unnamed player eventually tested positive). Although teams only played five games, the league announced it would pay all players their base salary for the rest of the season; players who received legitimate offers from the NFL or Canadian Football League (CFL) would be allowed to sign with those teams but with a clause requiring them to return to their XFL teams if the league were able to hold its championship game.\n\n## Sale and relaunch\n\nOn August 3, 2020, it was reported that a consortium led by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Gerry Cardinale (through Cardinale's fund RedBird Capital Partners) purchased the XFL for $15 million just hours before an auction could take place; the purchase received court approval on August 7, 2020. The XFL's parent company originally listed the league with assets and liabilities in the range of $10 million to $50 million. Johnson, who previously worked for McMahon as WWE wrestler The Rock, played collegiate football with the Miami Hurricanes in the 1990s and as a professional with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League; he and Garcia were married from 1997 to 2007 and have remained business partners since their divorce.\n\n## Teams\n\nOn July 25, 2022, Johnson and Garcia held a XFL Townhall at Texas Live! in Arlington where they confirmed all 2020 XFL markets except Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and New York would return. Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and New York would be replaced by teams in San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Orlando, respectively.\n\n## Timeline\n\n## Rule changes\n\nThe XFL ran test games with community colleges in Mississippi, Your Call Football, and The Spring League during their spring 2019 seasons, to experiment with rule changes. They hired Dean Blandino as their head of officiating. On December 7, 2022, the league confirmed it would be keeping the rulebook used in 2020.\n\n## Kickoffs\n\nThe league has an active interest in reviving the kickoffs as an element of the game, in contrast to the former AAF, which eliminated kickoffs outright, and the NFL and college football, both of which imposed rules minimizing the impact of the kickoff in the mid-2010s to improve player safety. Many of these kickoff rules were adapted from rules created by The Spring League's predecessor, the Fall Experimental Football League.\n\n## Punts\n\nThe conventional extra point kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt two points, and a ten-yard attempt three points. This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs. The Stars Football League also used the rule during its existence. In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score. In the event of a defensive penalty during the conversion attempt, the defense is penalized half the distance to the goal but the value of the attempt remains the same as it was prior to the penalty being enforced.\n\n## Double-forward pass\n\nTeams can attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass. This also means that if a pass is batted back towards the quarterback, he is eligible to throw it again; Landry Jones of Dallas successfully utilized this rule in a game.\n\n## Fumbles into the defensive end zone\n\nBeginning in 2023, if an offensive player fumbles the ball from outside the end zone and it goes through the end zone without being recovered, the offense retains possession at the point of the fumble (if the fumble occurred on fourth down, final possession is determined by whether the ball carrier reached the line to gain before the fumble), consistent with the rule for other forward fumbles. At most other levels (except the USFL, which adopted the same rule at the same time), the team on offense loses possession of the ball and the opponent is awarded possession at its own 20-yard line.\n\n## Overtime\n\nOvertime is decided by a three-round shootout of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the NCAA adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the 2019 FBS season. Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball. The defense is not able to score, as should a turnover occur, the play would be dead. Defensive penalties result in the ball moving up to the 1-yard line, while any subsequent defensive penalty on any play, even in future rounds, result in a score awarded to the offensive team. Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted under regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score. If both teams remain tied after three rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw.\n\n## Clock changes\n\nThe football used in XFL games is the traditional brown color used in most other leagues, in contrast to the 2001 XFL's black and red ball. Each team has its own balls for use in home games, marked with the XFL and home team logo. For the 2020 XFL season, a two-tone \"X\" in the home team's colors adorned each point and runs through the middle of each panel of the ball, intended to allow the receivers to track the ball easily in lieu of striping. Five balls, each with a different texture of leather, were tested during the Summer Showcases and The Spring League. The winning texture, a custom patent-pending design known as \"X-Pebble,\" was released November 25, 2019.\n\n## Officiating changes\n\nThe XFL used the amateur football (high school and college) and CFL standard of one foot in bounds for a complete forward pass.\n\n## Proposed\n\n## Draft\n\nThe 2020 XFL Draft was held October 15 and 16, 2019, via conference call. Seventy-one players were allocated to each team in separate position drafts: one marquee quarterback allocated by the league to each team, ten skill positions, ten offensive linemen, ten defensive linemen and/or linebackers, ten defensive backs, and thirty players of any position. Due to the structure of the draft, there was no true first overall selection. A supplemental draft was held in late November.\n\n## 2023\n\nThe XFL 2023 draft took place at the UFC Apex in Enterprise, Nevada. The player pool consisted of 1,700 eligible players, after XFL personnel have evaluated nearly 6,000 players in seven XFL showcases, NFL training camps, and tryouts. Of those, 528 players advanced to the preseason rosters.\n\n## 2023 offseason (pre-merger)\n\nIn an interview after the 2023 season, XFL's Senior Vice President of Player Personnel Doug Whaley disclosed that the league planned a \"rookie\" draft scheduled for June 16, 2023, and would conduct \"multiple drafts\" in the fall of 2023.\n\n## Season structure\n\nThe XFL has a 10-week regular season, with each team hosting 5 home games, and no bye week. This is followed by a two-week post-season, featuring the top two teams in each division competing in a single-elimination bracket. The league is split into two divisions of four teams. Each team plays all three teams in their division twice, once each of home and road. Each team also plays the remaining teams in the league once. This is the same schedule model used by the original XFL and by the former AAF. Both leagues followed an Eastern/Western division model, which the XFL also confirmed during its Summer Showcase in Dallas. The XFL East includes New York, DC, Tampa, and St Louis, while the West includes Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston.\n\n## Players\n\nEach XFL team in 2020 had 52 players on its regular-season roster, far more than the 38 in the original XFL and comparable to the size of the 53-man NFL rosters. 46 of those 52 are active on any given game day.

he and Garcia were married from 1997 to 2007 and have remained business partners since their divorce Cardinale's previous investments included the New York Yankees' side projects (such as YES Network and Legends Hospitality) and Suddenlink Communications [81] On August 21, 2020, the transition of ownership was completed, with Johnson stating \"The deal is officially closed and 'the keys' to the XFL have been handed over.\" [82] On October 1, 2020, the XFL announced its return in spring 2022 [83] Johnson and Garcia both stated that they would rescind the policy forbidding kneeling during the national anthem and would instead openly support and encourage such behavior in an October 14 interview with Vice [84]\n\n\nCFL merger talks\nOn March 10, 2021, it was announced that the XFL and CFL had entered into formal talks ahead of \"opportunities for the leagues to collaborate, innovate, and grow the game of football\" According to XFL President & CEO Jeffrey Pollack, the league had decided to hit the pause button on their planned 2022 season, so they could focus on talks with the CFL Both sides have declined to rule out any particular outcome from their talks which could have theoretically included a merger or acquisition [85] [86] On July 7, 2021, both leagues ended the discussions with no agreement; in the same statement, the XFL cancelled its 2022 season, intending to return in \"Spring 2023\" [87]\n\n\n2023 season\nThe XFL's second return to play began with a game between the Vegas Vipers and Arlington Renegades on Saturday, February 18, 2023 [247] The first week of games received tentative praise, with Bill Shea of The Athletic grading the return a B− in an article titled, \"I watched the XFL 3.0 so you don't have to (but you should!): The key takeaways.\" [248] However, TV ratings declined in comparison to the XFL's 2020 debut 1.54 million people watched the first game in 2023, down from the 3.3 million who watched the first game aired on ABC in 2020 [249] Week 2's ratings again lagged as the games were the first to not air on broadcast television [250]\n\n\nXFL–USFL merger\nOn March 27, 2023, Garcia said in a USA Today interview that XFL started planning for the 2024 season and declared: \"absolutely, there will be a 2024 XFL football season.\" [112]\n\n\nTeams\nOn July 25, 2022, Johnson and Garcia held a XFL Townhall at Texas Live! in Arlington where they confirmed all 2020 XFL markets except Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and New York would return Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, and New York would be replaced by teams in San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Orlando respectively [122] [123]\n\n\nTimeline\n\" * \" indicates Championship Season\nDeactivated Teams in grey\n\n\nRule changes\nThe XFL ran test games with community colleges in Mississippi, Your Call Football, and The Spring League during their spring 2019 seasons, to experiment with rule changes It hired Dean Blandino as its head of officiating [126] [127] On December 7, 2022, the league confirmed it would be keeping the rulebook used in 2020 [128]\n\n\nKickoffs\nThe league has an active interest in reviving the kickoffs as an element of the game, in contrast to the former AAF, which eliminated kickoffs outright, and the NFL and college football, both of which imposed rules minimizing the impact of the kickoff in the mid-2010s to improve player safety [129] Many of these kickoff rules were adapted from rules created by The Spring League's predecessor, the Fall Experimental Football League: [130]\n\n\nPunts\nThe conventional extra point kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt two points, and a ten-yard attempt three points [136] (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs The Stars Football League also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score  In the event of a defensive penalty during the conversion attempt, the defense is penalized half the distance to the goal but the value of the attempt remains the same as it was prior to the penalty being enforced.\n\n\nPoints after touchdown\nThe conventional extra point kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt two points, and a ten-yard attempt three points [136] (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs The Stars Football League also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score  In the event of a defensive penalty during the conversion attempt, the defense is penalized half the distance to the goal but the value of the attempt remains the same as it was prior to the penalty being enforced.\n\n\nDouble-forward pass\nTeams can attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass This also means that if a pass is batted back towards the quarterback, he is eligible to throw it again; Landry Jones of Dallas successfully utilized this rule in a game.\n\n\nFumbles into the defensive end zone\nBeginning in 2023, if an offensive player fumbles the ball from outside the end zone and it goes through the end zone without being recovered, the offense retains possession at the point of the fumble (if the fumble occurred on fourth down, final possession is determined by whether the ball carrier reached the line to gain before the fumble), consistent with the rule for other forward fumbles At most other levels (except the USFL, which adopted the same rule at the same time), the team on offense loses possession of the ball and the opponent is awarded possession at its own 20-yard line [137]\n\n\nOvertime\nOvertime is decided by a three-round shootout of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the NCAA adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the 2019 FBS season [138] [139] Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball The defense is not able to score, as should a turnover occur, the play would be dead [132] Defensive penalties result in the ball moving up to the 1-yard line, while any subsequent defensive penalty on any play, even in future rounds, result in a score awarded to the offensive team Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted under regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score If both teams remain tied after three rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw [132] The overtime procedure was originally to be five rounds in 2020 had it been needed (none of the 20 games that season ended regulation with both teams tied) before it was reduced to three rounds prior to 2023 [128]\n\n\nClock changes\nThe football used in XFL games is the traditional brown color used in most other leagues, in contrast to the 2001 XFL's black and red ball Each team has its own balls for use in home games, marked with the XFL and home team logo [148] For the 2020 XFL season, a two-tone \"X\" in the home team's colors adorned each point and runs through the middle of each panel of the ball, intended to allow the receivers to track the ball easily in lieu of striping Five balls, each with a different texture of leather, were tested during the Summer Showcases and The Spring League [149] The winning texture, a custom patent-pending design known as \"X-Pebble\", was released November 25, 2019 [150] The design was created and is manufactured by Team Issue of Dallas, Texas, in what became their first professional football contract [151]\n\n\nOfficiating changes\nThe football used in XFL games is the traditional brown color used in most other leagues, in contrast to the

league used the amateur football (high school and college) and CFL standard of one foot in bounds for a complete forward pass [153]\n\n\nProposed\nThese were rule changes which the league had considered using, though they were either not officially tested or were discarded in preseason testing:\n\n\nDraft\nThe 2020 XFL Draft was held October 15 and 16, 2019, via conference call Seventy-one players were allocated to each team in separate position drafts: one marquee quarterback allocated by the league to each team, ten skill positions, ten offensive linemen, ten defensive linemen and/or linebackers, ten defensive backs, and thirty players of any position Due to the structure of the draft, there was no true first overall selection A supplemental draft was held in late November

player pool consisted of 1,700 eligible players, after XFL personnel have evaluated nearly 6,000 players in seven XFL showcases, [161] [162] [163] NFL training camps and tryouts [164] Of those, 528 players advanced to the preseason rosters [165]\n\n\n2023 offseason (pre-merger)\nIn an interview after the 2023 season, XFL's Senior Vice President of Player Personnel Doug Whaley disclosed that the league planned a \"rookie\" draft scheduled for June 16, 2023, and would conduct \"multiple drafts\" in the fall of 2023 [169]\n\n\nSeason structure\nThe XFL has a 10-week regular season, with each team hosting 5 home games, and no bye week [170] This is followed by a two-week post-season, featuring the top two teams in each division competing in a single-elimination bracket The league is split into two divisions of four teams Each team plays all three teams in their division twice, once each of home and road Each team also plays the remaining teams in the league once This is the same schedule model used by the original XFL and by the former AAF Both leagues followed an Eastern/Western division, [136] which the XFL also confirmed during its Summer Showcase in Dallas The XFL East includes New York, DC, Tampa, and St Louis while the West includes Seattle, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Houston [171]\n\n\nPlayers\nEach XFL team in 2020 had 52 players regular-season roster, far more than the 38 in the original XFL and comparable to the size of the 53-man NFL rosters; 46 of those 52 are active on any given game day [172] The league carried 51 players, with 46 active on game day in 2023.\n\n\nCurrent NFL players\nIn 2020, the XFL used a standard form contract paying $2,725 per week for each player on the active roster, $1,040 of which is guaranteed A $2,222 victory bonus is paid to the players on each game's winning team; this feature is a carryover from the original XFL The contracts expire at the end of the season, freeing players to sign with any other league [181] Players are also paid $1,040 per week during the preseason and through the playoffs if their team does not qualify [172] Starting quarterbacks make an annual salary of up to $495,000, [172] with the average XFL quarterback earning $125,000 [182]\n\n\nNotable players\nIn 2020, the XFL used a standard form contract paying $2,725 per week for each player on the active roster, $1,040 of which is guaranteed A

Orr of Sports Illustrated credited the league with generating positive social media buzz without relying on a single viral event (as the Alliance of American Football, which Orr had eviscerated in a three-part series for SI less than a year prior, had done with a singular hit on AAF quarterback Mike Bercovici) Orr summarized the XFL as \"on-the-rails, appropriately-quirky spring football.\" [242] Michael David Smith of Profootballtalk.com noted that \"there was a lot to like\" about the league [243]\n\n\n2023 season\nThe XFL's second return to play began with a game between the Vegas Vipers

season\nAfter the 2023 season concluded, Doug Whaley, XFL's Senior Vice President of Player Personnel, said in an interview that the league delaying contracts for 2024 season due to a potential unionization of players from \"another entity\" (not the USW), [169] later revealed to be the National Football League Players Association [192] Russ Giglio, Senior Director, Player Administration and Officiating Operations, also mentioned that 2023 season players has a mutual 'opt-in' agreement: \"The players that finish the season have a mutual option with the team to sign back The team wants the player back, the player wants to come back, we’ll sign a contract\" [169]  On December 29, 2023, XFL players were notified by Whaley that their current contracts and health benefits would expire on December 31, 2023 [193]\n\n\nPartnerships\nThe XFL ran test games with community colleges in Mississippi, Your Call Football (YCF), and The Spring League (TSL) during their spring 2019 seasons, to

the Supreme Gangsters, when he was involved in petty theft and muggings.\n\n\nBiography\nIn 1969, Hoover and David Barksdale called a truce and decided to combine both of their respective rival gangs (Supreme Gangsters and Black Disciples) together to become the Black Gangster Disciple Nation (BGDN) [12] [13] [14]\n\n\nGang and impact\nIn 1969, Hoover and David Barksdale called a truce and decided to combine both of their respective rival gangs (Supreme Gangsters and Black Disciples) together to become the Black Gangster Disciple Nation (BGDN) [12] [13] [14]\n\n\nDeath of David Barksdale and Disciple takeover\nIn 1974, after the leader of the Black Disciples, David Barksdale, died of kidney failure stemming from injuries incurred in a 1970 assassination attempt, Hoover took over the reins of the Black Gangster Disciple Nation He deemed himself the chairman of the crew At the time, the Disciples had control of Chicago's South Side turf Under Hoover's rule, the Black Gangster Disciple Nation took over a majority of the Chicago drug trade While incarcerated, in 1978, Hoover, formed the Folk Nation, which added all gangs in his personal likeliness and interest to relate to the BGDN such as the Lady, Satan, Maniac Latin, Spanish Gangster Disciples, Ambrose, the Two-Two Boys, Two Sixers, Simon City Royals, North Side Insane Popes, La Raza Nation, Spanish Cobras, Imperial Gangsters, Harrison Gents, and the Latin Eagles The Folk Nation maintained their ground from within prison property to drug-ruffled streets \n\n\nDispute with the Black Disciples\nIn 1989, the Black Gangster Disciples began having leadership problems as they noticed Hoover's leadership of the Folk Nation alliance deteriorated once he shifted his sole focus toward the now-splintered Gangster Disciples [21] The decline of the BGDN leadership infuriated a majority of its members and resulted in the two gangs separating into the aforementioned Gangster Disciples and the reincarnated Black Disciples One instance of their split and later animosity was a drug dealing dispute in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago's South Side, which escalated into a shooting that killed several people [22] By early 1993, Hoover claimed to have renounced his violent criminal past and became an urban political celebrity in Chicago Hoover proclaimed that the GD initials had changed to mean \"Growth & Development.\"\n\n\nLegal history\nOn the evening of February 26, 1973, William \"Pooky\" Young, a 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer, was abducted and later shot dead in an alley near 68th Street and Union Avenue in Englewood, a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago His killing was ordered by Hoover after his name was mentioned as one of three people accused of stealing drugs and money from the gang six days earlier [26] Andrew Howard was arrested on March 16, 1973 while Hoover went in to hiding in Chicago On September 21, 1973 Hoover was driving a stolen truck and was asked to stop for a traffic violation He tried to run away from the scene but was arrested The police also discovered that he was also wanted in William Young's murder In October 1973, Howard and Hoover were both indicted for murder and in December both were sentenced to life imprisonment plus 200 years in prison Hoover was sent to Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, to serve out his term [27]\n\n\n1973: William Young murder\nOn the evening of February 26, 1973, William \"Pooky\" Young, a 19-year-old neighborhood drug dealer, was abducted and later shot dead in an alley near 68th Street and Union Avenue in Englewood, a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago His killing was ordered by Hoover after his name was mentioned as one of three people accused of stealing drugs and money from the gang six days earlier [26] Andrew Howard was arrested on March 16, 1973 while Hoover went in to hiding in Chicago On September 21, 1973 Hoover was driving a stolen truck and was asked to stop for a traffic violation He tried to run away from the scene but was arrested The police also discovered that he was also wanted in William Young's murder In October 1973, Howard and Hoover were both indicted for murder and in December both were sentenced to life imprisonment plus 200 years in prison Hoover was sent to Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, to serve out his term [27]\n\n\n1997: Criminal enterprise conviction\nWhile in prison for murder, on August 22, 1995, after a 17-year undercover joint investigation by the Illinois Department of Corrections, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Hoover was indicted for conspiracy, extortion, money laundering, drug-related offenses, and continuing to engage in a criminal enterprise [28] A lengthy federal investigation using wiretaps led to Hoover getting arrested Prosecutors alleged that his gang had 30,000 \"soldiers\" in 35 states and made $100 million a year He was arrested at the Dixon Correctional Center by federal agents, and moved to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago to stand trial In 1997, Hoover was found guilty on all charges He was sentenced to three additional life terms in federal prison Hoover is currently serving his sentence at the ADX Florence in Fremont County, Colorado [5] [29]\n\n\nAttempts to appeal\nIn 2021, Hoover, having hired Bill Cosby's former attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, tried to appeal his sentence under the First Step Act, but was denied by U.S Judge Harry Leinenweber [24] [30]\n\n\nOther endeavors\nIn 1996, Hoover's teachings were published in a book titled The Blueprint of a New Concept: From Gangster Disciple to Growth & Development [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nBook\nIn 1996, Hoover's teachings were published in a book titled The Blueprint of a New Concept: From Gangster Disciple to Growth & Development [31] [32] [33]\n\n\nThe Larry Hoover Project\nIn 2014, Hoover's wife, Winndye Jenkins-Hoover, created the Larry Hoover Project, aimed to give her husband clemency and have his criminal history reviewed [34]\n\n\nKanye West involvement\nChicago rapper Kanye West has, for over a decade, been a vocal advocate for Hoover's release from prison On a demo version of his song \"Hurricane\", which was meant to appear on his since-scrapped project, Yandhi, West suggested calling his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, to help release Hoover, following Kardashian's success on working with U.S president Donald Trump to free a number of federal prisoners [35] On October 11, 2018, during a luncheon with Trump, West pleaded for clemency for Hoover [36]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nHoover appears via phone from prison on multiple skits of Geto Boys' 1996 album, The Resurrection, where he discusses his views on the prison system and the youth of the black community By association with the Geto Boys, Rap-A-Lot Records founder J Prince has shown support for Hoover following his incarceration and as of 2022, is calling for him to be pardoned [44]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant", "content": "\nClassification\nOn 26 November 2021, the WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution declared PANGO lineage B.1.1.529 a variant of concern and designated it with the Greek letter omicron [10] The WHO skipped the preceding letters nu and xi in the Greek alphabet to avoid confusion with the similarities of the English word \"new\" and the Chinese surname Xi [22]\n\n\nHistory\nOmicron was first detected on 22 November 2021 in laboratories in Botswana and South Africa based on samples collected on 11–16 November, [27] with the first known samples collected in Johannesburg, South Africa on 8 November 2021 [28] The first known cases outside of South Africa were two people who travelled on 11 November: one who flew from South Africa to Hong Kong via Qatar, and another who travelled from Egypt to Belgium via Turkey [29] [30] On 26 November 2021, the WHO designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern and named it \"Omicron\", after the fifteenth letter in the Greek alphabet [10] By 6 January 2022, the variant had been confirmed in 149 countries [31]\n\n\nOrigin hypotheses\nOmicron did not evolve from any other variant, but instead diverged on a distinct track, perhaps in 2020 [31] [33] Competing hypotheses are being examined.\n\n\nSpread\nAs of 17 January 2022, BA.2 had been detected in at least 40 countries and in all continents except Antarctica [143] By 31 January, it had been detected in at least 57 countries [144] In global samples collected from 4 February to 5 March and uploaded to GISAID, BA.2 accounted for c 34%, compared to 41% for BA.1.1, 25% for BA.1 and less than 1% for BA.3 [145] In a review two weeks later, covering 16 February to 17 March, BA.2 had become the most frequent [146] [147] Based on GISAID uploads, BA.1 peaked in January 2022, after which it was overtaken by both BA.1.1 and BA.2 [148] In North America, parts of Europe and parts of Asia, BA.1 was first outcompeted by BA.1.1 For example, in the United States, France and Japan, BA.1.1 became the dominant subvariant in January 2022 [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nReactions\nOn 26 November 2021, BioNTech said it would know in two weeks whether the current vaccine is effective against the variant and that an updated vaccine could be shipped in 100 days if necessary AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were also studying the variant's impact on the effectiveness of their vaccines [95] On the same day, Novavax stated that it was developing an updated vaccine requiring two doses for the Omicron variant, which the company expected to be ready for testing and manufacturing within a few weeks [96] [97] On 29 November 2021, The Gamaleya Institute said that Sputnik Light should be effective against the variant, that it would begin adapting Sputnik V, and that a modified version could be ready for mass production in 45 days [98] Sinovac said it could quickly mass-produce an inactivated vaccine against the variant and that it was monitoring studies and collecting samples of the variant to determine if a new vaccine is needed [99]\n\n\nVaccine producers\nOn 26 November

inactivated vaccine against the variant and that it was monitoring studies and collecting samples of the variant to determine if a new vaccine is needed [99]\n\n\nWorld Health Organization\nOn 26 November 2021, the WHO asked nations to enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts, submit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID, report initial cases/clusters associated with virus-of-concern infection to the WHO through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism, where capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the virus of concern on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, and the effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics [103]\nOn 26 November 2021, the WHO advised countries not to impose new restrictions on travel, instead recommending a \"risk-based and scientific\" approach to travel measures [104] On the same day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported modeling indicating that strict travel restrictions would delay the variant's impact on European countries by two weeks, possibly allowing countries to prepare for it [105]\nAs with other variants, the WHO recommended that people continue to keep enclosed spaces well ventilated, avoid crowding and close contact, wear well-fitting masks, clean hands frequently, and get vaccinated [106] [107] On 29 November 2021, the WHO said cases and infections were expected among those vaccinated, albeit in a small and predictable proportion [108]\n\n\nInternational response\nAfter the WHO announcement, on the same day, several countries announced travel bans from southern Africa in response to the identification of the variant, including the United States, which banned travel from eight African countries, [109] although as of 30 November 2021 it notably did not ban travel from any European countries, Israel, Canada, or Australia where cases were also detected at the time the bans were announced Other countries that also implemented travel bans include Japan, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Morocco, and New Zealand [110] [111]\n\n\nBiology\nAs of June 2022, Omicron had about 50 mutations relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 or B variant, [125] [126] which is more than any previous SARS-CoV-2 variant Thirty-two of these pertained to the spike protein, which most vaccines target to neutralise the virus [127] As of December 2021, many mutations were novel and not found in previous variants [43] As of April 2022 the variant was characterised by 30 amino acid changes, three small deletions, and one small insertion in the spike protein compared with the original virus, of which 15 are located in the receptor-binding domain (residues 319–541) [128] As of December 2022 the virus carried a number of changes and deletions in other genomic regions For example, three mutations at the furin cleavage site, which facilitates its transmission [129] [130]\n\n\nMutations\nAs of June 2022, Omicron had about 50 mutations relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 or B variant, [125] [126] which is more

three mutations at the furin cleavage site, which facilitates its transmission [129] [130]\n\n\nSubvariants\nSeveral subvariants of Omicron have been discovered and new ones continue to emerge [12] There are 310 Pango lineages [clarification needed] currently associated with the Omicron variant [133] The 'standard' sublineage is now referred to as BA.1 (or B.1.1.529.1), and the two other sublineages are known as BA.2 (or B.1.1.529.2) and BA.3 (or B.1.1.529.3) [134] In 2022, BA.4 (or B.1.1.529.4) and BA.5 (or B.1.1.529.5) were detected in several countries [135] They share many mutations, but also significantly differ In general, BA.1 and BA.2 share 32 mutations, but differ by 28 [136] BA.1 has itself been divided in two, the original BA.1 and BA.1.1 (or B.1.1.529.1.1) where the main difference is that the latter has a R346K mutation [137]\n\n\nBA.2\nBA.2 was first detected in a sample from 15 November 2021 [140] A preprint released in February 2022 (published in May) suggested that BA.2 was more transmissible than BA.1 and may cause more severe disease [141] This was later disproven by a study in late-October 2022, that found BA.2 actually caused less severe disease relative to BA.1 (which in turn, caused less severe disease compared to the delta variant) [142] Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used to treat people infected with COVID-19 did not have much effect on BA.2, which was \"almost completely resistant\" to casirivimab and imdevimab, and 35 times more resistant to sotrovimab than the BA.1 subvariant [citation needed]\n\n\nSpread\nAs of 17 January 2022, BA.2 had been detected in at least 40 countries and in all continents except Antarctica [143] By 31 January, it had been detected in at least 57 countries [144] In global samples collected from 4 February to 5 March and uploaded to GISAID, BA.2 accounted for c 34%, compared to 41% for BA.1.1, 25% for BA.1 and less than 1% for BA.3 [145] In a review two weeks later, covering 16 February to 17 March, BA.2 had become the most frequent [146] [147] Based on GISAID uploads, BA.1 peaked in January 2022, after which it was overtaken by both BA.1.1 and BA.2 [148] In North America, parts of Europe and parts of Asia, BA.1 was first outcompeted by BA.1.1 For example, in the United States, France and Japan, BA.1.1 became the dominant subvariant in January 2022 [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nXE\nA new BA.1–BA.2 recombinant was isolated in the UK in January 2022, dubbed the \"XE\" recombinant It was found by the WHO to be potentially 10% more transmissible than BA.2, making it about 43% to 76% to more transmissible than BA.1, and making the XE recombinant the most contagious variant identified at the time [168]\n\n\nBA.2.12\nThere were two new BA.2 subvariants detected in the US state of New York, which are BA.2.12 (or B.1.1.529.2.12) and BA.2.12.1 (or B.1.1.529.2.12.1), both of which have a significant growth advantage of 23–27% over BA.2 and contributing to a rise in infections in central New York, centred on Syracuse and Lake Ontario, which later became dominant by 24 May 2022, in the US [169]\n\n\nBA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2\nThe subvariant BA.2.75 (or B.1.1.529.2.75, nicknamed Centaurus by the media [170]), first detected in India in May 2022, was classified as variant under monitoring by the WHO [171] Additional newer mutations in this line (like BA.2.75.2 aka B.1.1.529.2.75.2 or Chiron) may be capable of escaping neutralizing antibodies [172]\n\n\nXBB and XBB.1\nXBB, a recombinant of the BA.2.10.1.1 and BA.2.75.3.1.1.1 sublineages, [173] is an Omicron subvariant first detected in August 2022 [174]\n\n\nEG.5 and EG.5.1\nEG.5 (or XBB.1.9.2.5), nicknamed by some media \"Eris\", [181] is a descendant of XBB.1.9.2 The lineage was detected as early as February 2023 [182] On 6 August, the UK Health Security Agency reported the EG.5 strain was responsible for one in seven new cases in the UK during the third week of July [183] It was identified as a \"variant of interest\" by the WHO on 9 August 2023 Its key difference from other strains is a \"F456L amino acid mutation\" [184]\n\n\nHV.1\nHV.1 (or XBB.1.9.2.5.1.6.1) is a sublineage of XBB.1.9.2, of the Omicron family first detected in July 2023.\n\n\nBA.2.86\nIn April 2022, the WHO announced it was tracking the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants with BA.4 having been detected in South Africa, Botswana, Denmark, Scotland and England [197] Early indications from data collected in South Africa suggested BA.4 and BA.5 have a significant growth advantage over BA.2, which by 12 May earned the status Variant of Concern by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and, by 20 May, by the UK Health Security Agency [198] [199] [200] [201] BA.5 was dominant in Portugal by 25 May, accounting for two-thirds of all new cases there [202] By 24 June, BA.4 and BA.5 together had become dominant variants in the UK and Germany [203] [204] [205] [206] These two subvariants became dominant in the United States by 28 June [207] [208] By June, BA.5 became the dominant subvariant in France, with 59% of new cases linked to it [209] [210]\n\n\nBA.4 and BA.5\nIn May 2022, a preprint indicated Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 could cause a large share of COVID-19 reinfections, beyond the increase of reinfections caused by the Omicron lineage, even for people who were infected by Omicron BA.1 due to increases in immune evasion, especially for the unvaccinated However, the observed escape of BA.4 and BA.5 from immunity by a BA.1 infection is more moderate than of BA.1 against studied prior cases of immunity (such as immunity from specific vaccines) [263] [264]\n\n\nBQ.1 and BQ.1.1\nSubvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were found in 2022, to be better at escaping first and booster vaccines than previous variants, and to have further reduced the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatments [267]\n\n\nLater subvariants\nLate in April 2024, CDC data showed KP.2 to be the most common U.S variant, with a quarter of all cases, just ahead of JN.1 KP1.1 represented 7 percent of U.S cases [223]  These two are sometimes referred to as the 'FLiRT' variants because they are characterized by a phenylalanine (F) to leucine (L) mutation and an arginine (R) to threonine (T) mutation in the virus's spike protein [224] By July 2024, a descendant of KP.2 with an extra amino acid change in the spike protein, Q493E, was given the names KP.3 and, informally, 'FLuQE,' and became a major variant in New South Wales during the Australian winter Initial research suggested that the Q493E change could help KP.3 be more effective at binding to human cells than KP.2 [225]\n\n\nTransmission\nIn January 2022, William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared the contagiousness of the Omicron variant to that of the measles [228]\n\n\nIn humans\nIn January 2022, William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared the contagiousness of the Omicron variant to that of the measles [228]\n\n\nIn non-human animals\nIn February 2022, the first confirmed case infecting a wild animal was confirmed by researchers at Pennsylvania State University in white-tailed deer in Staten Island, N.Y [241]\n\n\nSurfaces\nAlthough transmission via fomites is rare, preliminary data indicate that the variant lasts for 194 hours on plastic surfaces and 21 hours on skin, compared with just 56 and 7 hours, respectively, for the original strain [242] [243]\n\n\nVaccine effectiveness\nPfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccines provide reduced protection against asymptomatic disease but do reduce the risk of serious illness [244] [245] [246] On 22 December 2021, the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team reported an about 41% (95% CI, 37–45%) lower risk of a hospitalization requiring a stay of at least 1 night compared to the Delta variant, and that the data suggested that recipients of 2 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech, the Moderna or the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine were substantially protected from hospitalization [247] In January 2022, results from Israel suggested that a fourth dose is only partially effective against Omicron Many cases of infection broke through, albeit \"a bit less than in the control group\", even though trial participants had higher antibody levels after the fourth dose [248] On 23 December 2021, Nature indicates that, though Omicron likely weakens vaccine protection, reasonable effectiveness against Omicron may be maintained with currently available vaccination and boosting approaches [249] [250]\n\n\nBA.1 and BA.2\nA January 2022 study by the UK Health Security Agency found that vaccines afforded similar levels of protection against symptomatic disease by BA.1 and BA.2, and in both it was considerably higher after two doses and a booster than two doses without booster, [261] [262] though because of the gradually waning effect of vaccines, further booster vaccination may later be necessary [166]\n\n\nBA.4 and BA.5\nIn May 2022, a preprint indicated Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 could cause a large share of COVID-19 reinfections, beyond the increase of reinfections caused by the Omicron lineage, even for people who were infected by Omicron BA.1 due to increases in immune evasion, especially for the unvaccinated However, the observed escape of BA.4 and BA.5 from immunity by a BA.1 infection is more moderate than of BA.1 against studied prior cases of immunity (such as immunity from specific vaccines) [263] [264]\n\n\nBQ.1 and BQ.1.1\nSubvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were found in 2022, to be better at escaping first and booster vaccines than previous variants, and to have further reduced the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatments [267]\n\n\nVaccine adjustments\nIn June 2022, Pfizer and Moderna developed bivalent vaccines to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and the Omicron variant The bivalent vaccines are well-tolerated and offer immunity to Omicron superior to previous mRNA vaccines [268] In September 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the bivalent vaccines [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nLoss of taste and smell seem to be uncommon compared to other strains [5] [6] A unique reported symptom of the Omicron variant is night sweats, [7] [276] particularly with the BA.5 subvariant [277] [278] A study performed between 1 and 7 December 2021 by the Center for Disease Control found that: \"The most commonly reported symptoms  [were] cough, fatigue, and congestion or runny nose\" making it difficult to distinguish from a less damaging variant or another virus [279] Research published in London on 25 December 2021 suggested the most frequent symptoms stated by users of the Zoe Covid app were \"a runny nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats.\" [4]\n\n\nVirulence\nAs of 6 January 2022, Omicron multiplied around 70 times faster than the Delta variant in the bronchi (lung airways) but evidence suggested it is less severe than previous variants, especially compared to Delta, [281] [238] since it might be less able to penetrate deep lung tissue [282] As of January 2022, in southern California infections were 91 percent less fatal than the delta variant, with 51 percent less risk of hospitalization [283] However, the estimated difference in the intrinsic risk of hospitalization in England largely decreased to 0–30 percent, when reinfections were excluded [284]\n\n\nDiagnosis\n As of November 2021, the chance of detecting an Omicron case particularly depended on a country's sequencing rate, with South Africa sequencing far more samples than any other country in Africa, but at a considerably lower rate than most Western nations [287] [288] Sequencing the virus from a sample can take weeks limiting the early availability of data [289]\n\n\nPCR testing\nIn December 2021, the US FDA published guidelines on how PCR tests would be affected by Omicron [293] Tests that detect multiple gene targets were to continue to identify the testee as positive for COVID-19 S-gene dropout or target failure was proposed as a shorthand way of differentiating Omicron from Delta besides sequencing and genotyping [294]\n\n\nBA.1 and BA.2 differences\nAs of 7 December 2021 it was known that BA.2, unlike BA.1, lacks the characteristic S-gene target failure (SGTF) causing deletion (Δ69-70), by which many qPCR tests have been able to rapidly detect a case as an Omicron (or Alpha) variant, from the previously dominant Delta variant [298] [299] Thus, countries which primarily rely on SGTF for detection may overlook BA.2, [298] and British authorities consider SGTF alone as insufficient for monitoring the spread of Omicron [285] This has resulted in it having been nicknamed 'Stealth Omicron', [285] but because BA.2 still can be separated from other variants through normal full sequencing, or checks of certain other mutations, the nickname is not quite accurate [136] [300] As of January 2022, some countries, such as Denmark and Japan, have been using a variant qPCR which tests for several mutations, including L452R [295] [157] It can also distinguish Delta, which has L452R, [301] and all Omicron subvariants, which do not have L452R [302] [143] As Omicron became dominant and the Delta variant became rare in 2022, the SGTF mutation that had made Delta and BA.2 similar in qPCR tests was found to be useful for separating BA.1 and BA.2 from each other [303]\n\n\nTreatment\nAs of 28 November 2021, Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and IL6 receptor blockers such as tocilizumab (Actemra) were known to be effective for managing patients with the earlier strains of severe COVID-19 but the impact on the effectiveness of other treatments was being assessed [304] [305]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nOn 26 November 2021, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases announced that 30,904 COVID-19-tests (in one day) detected 2,828 new COVID-19 infections (a 9.2% positivity rate) [311]\nOne week later, on 3 December 2021, the NICD announced that 65,990 COVID-19 tests had found 16,055 new infections (5.7 times as many as seven days before; positive rate 24.3%) and that 72 percent of them were found in Gauteng [312] [313]\nThis province of South Africa is densely populated at about 850 inhabitants per km2 Gauteng's capital Johannesburg is a megacity (about 5.5 million inhabitants in the city itself plus 9.5 million in the urban region) [citation needed]\n\n\nReported cases\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant**\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is a variant of concern of the virus that causes COVID-19, first detected in November 2021. It was designated a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 26, 2021, and named Omicron, the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Omicron variant was first detected in laboratories in Botswana and South Africa on November 22, 2021, based on samples collected on November 11-16. The first known samples were collected in Johannesburg, South Africa on November 8, 2021. The first known cases outside of South Africa were two people who traveled on November 11: one who flew from South Africa to Hong Kong via Qatar, and another who traveled from Egypt to Belgium via Turkey.\n\n**Origin hypotheses**\n\nThe Omicron variant did not evolve from any other variant, but instead diverged on a distinct track, perhaps in 2020. Competing hypotheses are being examined.\n\n**Spread**\n\nAs of January 17, 2022, the Omicron variant had been detected in at least 40 countries and in all continents except Antarctica. By January 31, it had been detected in at least 57 countries. In global samples collected from February 4 to 5 and uploaded to GISAID, the Omicron variant accounted for approximately 34%, compared to 41% for BA.1.1, 25% for BA.1, and less than 1% for BA.3.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nOn November 26, 2021, BioNTech said it would know in two weeks whether the current vaccine is effective against the variant and that an updated vaccine could be shipped in 100 days if necessary. AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson were also studying the variant's impact on the effectiveness of their vaccines. Novavax stated that it was developing an updated vaccine requiring two doses for the Omicron variant, which the company expected to be ready for testing and manufacturing within a few weeks.\n\n**Vaccine producers**\n\nBioNTech said it would know in two weeks whether the current vaccine is effective against the variant and that an updated vaccine could be shipped in 100 days if necessary. AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson were also studying the variant's impact on the effectiveness of their vaccines. Novavax stated that it was developing an updated vaccine requiring two doses for the Omicron variant, which the company expected to be ready for testing and manufacturing within a few weeks. The Gamaleya Institute said that Sputnik Light should be effective against the variant, that it would begin adapting Sputnik V, and that a modified version could be ready for mass production in 45 days. Sinovac said it could quickly mass-produce an inactivated vaccine against the variant and that it was monitoring studies and collecting samples of the variant to determine if a new vaccine is needed.\n\n**World Health Organization**\n\nOn November 26, 2021, the WHO asked nations to enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts, submit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, and report initial cases/clusters associated with virus-of-concern infection to the WHO through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism. The WHO also recommended a \"risk-based and scientific\" approach to travel measures.\n\n**International response**\n\nSeveral countries announced travel bans from southern Africa in response to the identification of the variant, including the United States, Japan, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Morocco, and New Zealand.\n\n**Biology**\n\nAs of June 2022, the Omicron variant had approximately 50 mutations relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 or B variant, which is more than any previous SARS-CoV-2 variant. Thirty-two of these pertained to the spike protein, which most vaccines target to neutralize the virus. As of December 2021, many mutations were novel and not found in previous variants.\n\n**Subvariants**\n\nSeveral subvariants of the Omicron variant have been discovered and new ones continue to emerge. These include BA.2, XE, BA.2.12, BA.2.75, BA.2.75.2, XBB, XBB.1, EG.5, EG.5.1, HV.1, BA.2.86, BA.4, BA.5, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nThe Omicron variant is highly contagious and can spread quickly from person to person. In January 2022, William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared the contagiousness of the Omicron variant to that of the measles.\n\n**Vaccine effectiveness**\n\nPfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccines provide reduced protection against asymptomatic disease but do reduce the risk of serious illness. A study by the UK Health Security Agency found that vaccines afforded similar levels of protection against symptomatic disease by BA.1 and BA.2, and in both it was considerably higher after two doses and a booster than two doses without booster.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nLoss of taste and smell seem to be uncommon compared to other strains. A unique reported symptom of the Omicron variant is night sweats, particularly with the BA.5 subvariant. A study performed between December 1 and 7, 2021, by the Center for Disease Control found that the most commonly reported symptoms were cough, fatigue, and congestion or runny nose.\n\n**Virulence**\n\nAs of January 6, 2022, the Omicron variant multiplied around 70 times faster than the Delta variant in the bronchi (lung airways) but evidence suggested it is less severe than previous variants, especially compared to Delta. In southern California, infections were 91% less fatal than the delta variant, with 51% less risk of hospitalization.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nAs of November 2021, the chance of detecting an Omicron case particularly depended on a country's sequencing rate, with South Africa sequencing far more samples than any other country in Africa. Sequencing the virus from a sample can take weeks, limiting the early availability of data.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nCorticosteroids such as dexamethasone and IL6 receptor blockers such as tocilizumab (Actemra) were known to be effective for managing patients with the earlier strains of severe COVID-19, but the impact on the effectiveness of other treatments was being assessed.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nOn November 26, 2021, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases announced that 30,904 COVID-19-tests detected 2,828 new COVID-19 infections, a 9.2% positivity rate. One week later, on December 3, 2021, the NICD announced that 65,990 COVID-19 tests had found 16,055 new infections, a 5.7 times increase from the previous week, with a positive rate of 24.3%. This province of South Africa is densely populated at about 850 inhabitants per km2.\n\n**Reported cases**\n\nThe number of reported cases of the Omicron variant has continued to increase globally, with over 100 countries reporting cases as of January 2022. The variant has been detected in all continents except Antarctica.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has been a major public health concern, and its spread has been closely monitored by health authorities around the world. The variant has also been the subject of extensive research, with scientists studying its characteristics, transmission, and impact on human health.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant\" following this outline:\n\n\nClassification\nOn 26 November 2021, the WHO's Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution declared PANGO lineage B.1.1.529 a variant of concern and designated it with the Greek letter omicron [10] The WHO skipped the preceding letters nu and xi in the Greek alphabet to avoid confusion with the similarities of the English word \"new\" and the Chinese surname Xi [22]\n\n\nHistory\nOmicron was first detected on 22 November 2021 in laboratories in Botswana and South Africa based on samples collected on 11–16 November, [27] with the first known samples collected in Johannesburg, South Africa on 8 November 2021 [28] The first known cases outside of South Africa were two people who travelled on 11 November: one who flew from South Africa to Hong Kong via Qatar, and another who travelled from Egypt to Belgium via Turkey [29] [30] On 26 November 2021, the WHO designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern and named it \"Omicron\", after the fifteenth letter in the Greek alphabet [10] By 6 January 2022, the variant had been confirmed in 149 countries [31]\n\n\nOrigin hypotheses\nOmicron did not evolve from any other variant, but instead diverged on a distinct track, perhaps in 2020 [31] [33] Competing hypotheses are being examined.\n\n\nSpread\nAs of 17 January 2022, BA.2 had been detected in at least 40 countries and in all continents except Antarctica [143] By 31 January, it had been detected in at least 57 countries [144] In global samples collected from 4 February to 5 March and uploaded to GISAID, BA.2 accounted for c 34%, compared to 41% for BA.1.1, 25% for BA.1 and less than 1% for BA.3 [145] In a review two weeks later, covering 16 February to 17 March, BA.2 had become the most frequent [146] [147] Based on GISAID uploads, BA.1 peaked in January 2022, after which it was overtaken by both BA.1.1 and BA.2 [148] In North America, parts of Europe and parts of Asia, BA.1 was first outcompeted by BA.1.1 For example, in the United States, France and Japan, BA.1.1 became the dominant subvariant in January 2022 [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nReactions\nOn 26 November 2021, BioNTech said it would know in two weeks whether the current vaccine is effective against the variant and that an updated vaccine could be shipped in 100 days if necessary

[99]\n\n\nWorld Health Organization\nOn 26 November 2021, the WHO asked nations to enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts, submit complete genome sequences and associated metadata to a publicly available database, such as GISAID, report initial cases/clusters associated with virus-of-concern infection to the WHO through the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism, where capacity exists and in coordination with the international community, perform field investigations and laboratory assessments to improve understanding of the potential impacts of the virus of concern on COVID-19 epidemiology, severity, and the effectiveness of public health and social measures, diagnostic methods, immune responses, antibody neutralization, or other relevant characteristics [103]\nOn 26 November 2021, the WHO advised countries not to impose new restrictions on travel, instead recommending a \"risk-based and scientific\" approach to travel measures [104] On the same day, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported modeling indicating that strict travel restrictions would delay the variant's impact on European countries by two weeks, possibly allowing countries to prepare for it [105]\nAs with other variants, the WHO recommended that people continue to keep enclosed spaces well ventilated, avoid crowding and close contact, wear well-fitting masks, clean hands frequently, and get vaccinated [106] [107] On 29 November 2021, the WHO said cases and infections were expected among those vaccinated, albeit in a small and predictable proportion [108]\n\n\nInternational response\nAfter the WHO announcement, on the same day, several countries announced travel bans from southern Africa in response to the identification of the variant, including the United States, which banned travel from eight African countries, [109] although as of 30 November 2021 it notably did not ban travel from any European countries, Israel, Canada, or Australia where cases were also detected at the time the bans were announced Other countries that also implemented travel bans include Japan, Canada, the European Union, Israel, Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Morocco, and New Zealand [110] [111]\n\n\nBiology\nAs of June 2022, Omicron had about 50 mutations relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 or B variant, [125] [126] which is more than any previous SARS-CoV-2 variant Thirty-two of these pertained to the spike protein, which most vaccines target to neutralise the virus [127] As of December 2021, many mutations were novel and not found in previous variants [43] As of April 2022 the variant was characterised by 30 amino acid changes, three small deletions, and one small insertion in the spike protein compared with the original virus, of which 15 are located in the receptor-binding domain (residues 319–541) [128] As of December 2022 the virus carried a number of changes and deletions in other genomic regions For example, three mutations at the furin cleavage site, which facilitates its transmission [129] [130]\n\n\nMutations\nAs of June 2022, Omicron had about 50 mutations relative

changes and deletions in other genomic regions For example, three mutations at the furin cleavage site, which facilitates its transmission [129] [130]\n\n\nSubvariants\nSeveral subvariants of Omicron have been discovered and new ones continue to emerge [12] There are 310 Pango lineages [clarification needed] currently associated with the Omicron variant [133] The 'standard' sublineage is now referred to as BA.1 (or B.1.1.529.1), and the two other sublineages are known as BA.2 (or B.1.1.529.2) and BA.3 (or B.1.1.529.3) [134] In 2022, BA.4 (or B.1.1.529.4) and BA.5 (or B.1.1.529.5) were detected in several countries [135] They share many mutations, but also significantly differ In general, BA.1 and BA.2 share 32 mutations, but differ by 28 [136] BA.1 has itself been divided in two, the original BA.1 and BA.1.1 (or B.1.1.529.1.1) where the main difference is that the latter has a R346K mutation [137]\n\n\nBA.2\nBA.2 was first detected in a sample from 15 November 2021 [140] A preprint released in February 2022 (published in May) suggested that BA.2 was more transmissible than BA.1 and may cause more severe disease [141] This was later disproven by a study in late-October 2022, that found BA.2 actually caused less severe disease relative to BA.1 (which in turn, caused less severe disease compared to the delta variant) [142] Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used to treat people infected with COVID-19 did not have much effect on BA.2, which was \"almost completely resistant\" to casirivimab and imdevimab, and 35 times more resistant to sotrovimab than the BA.1 subvariant [citation needed]\n\n\nSpread\nAs of 17 January 2022, BA.2 had been detected in at least 40 countries and in all continents except Antarctica [143] By 31 January, it had been detected in at least 57 countries [144] In global samples collected from 4 February to 5 March and uploaded to GISAID, BA.2 accounted for c 34%, compared to 41% for BA.1.1, 25% for BA.1 and less than 1% for BA.3 [145] In a review two weeks later, covering 16 February to 17 March, BA.2 had become the most frequent [146] [147] Based on GISAID uploads, BA.1 peaked in January 2022, after which it was overtaken by both BA.1.1 and BA.2 [148] In North America, parts of Europe and parts of Asia, BA.1 was first outcompeted by BA.1.1 For example, in the United States, France and Japan, BA.1.1 became the dominant subvariant in January 2022 [149] [150] [151]\n\n\nXE\nA new BA.1–BA.2 recombinant was isolated in the UK in January 2022, dubbed the \"XE\" recombinant It was found by the WHO to be potentially 10% more transmissible than BA.2, making it about 43% to 76% to more transmissible than BA.1, and making the XE recombinant the most contagious variant identified at the time [168]\n\n\nBA.2.12\nThere were two new BA.2 subvariants detected in the US state of New York, which are BA.2.12 (or B.1.1.529.2.12) and BA.2.12.1 (or B.1.1.529.2.12.1), both of which have a significant growth advantage of 23–27% over BA.2 and contributing to a rise in infections in central New York, centred on Syracuse and Lake Ontario, which later became dominant by 24 May 2022, in the US [169]\n\n\nBA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2\nThe subvariant BA.2.75 (or B.1.1.529.2.75, nicknamed Centaurus by the media [170]), first detected in India in May 2022, was classified as variant under monitoring by the WHO [171] Additional newer mutations in this line (like BA.2.75.2 aka B.1.1.529.2.75.2 or Chiron) may be capable of escaping neutralizing antibodies [172]\n\n\nXBB and XBB.1\nXBB, a recombinant of the BA.2.10.1.1 and BA.2.75.3.1.1.1 sublineages, [173] is an Omicron subvariant first detected in August 2022 [174]\n\n\nEG.5 and EG.5.1\nEG.5 (or XBB.1.9.2.5), nicknamed by some media \"Eris\", [181] is a descendant of XBB.1.9.2 The lineage was detected as early as February 2023 [182] On 6 August, the UK Health Security Agency reported the EG.5 strain was responsible for one in seven new cases in the UK during the third week of July [183] It was identified as a \"variant of interest\" by the WHO on 9 August 2023 Its key difference from other strains is a \"F456L amino acid mutation\" [184]\n\n\nHV.1\nHV.1 (or XBB.1.9.2.5.1.6.1) is a sublineage of XBB.1.9.2, of the Omicron family first detected in July 2023.\n\n\nBA.2.86\nIn April 2022, the WHO announced it was tracking the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants with BA.4 having been detected in South Africa, Botswana, Denmark, Scotland and England [197] Early indications from data collected in South Africa suggested BA.4 and BA.5 have a significant growth advantage over BA.2, which by 12 May earned the status Variant of Concern by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and, by 20 May, by the UK Health Security Agency [198] [199] [200] [201] BA.5 was dominant in Portugal by 25 May, accounting for two-thirds of all new cases there [202] By 24 June, BA.4 and BA.5 together had become dominant variants in the UK and Germany [203] [204] [205] [206] These two subvariants became dominant in the United States by 28 June [207] [208] By June, BA.5 became the dominant subvariant in France, with 59% of new cases linked to it [209] [210]\n\n\nBA.4 and BA.5\nIn May 2022, a preprint indicated Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 could cause a large share of COVID-19 reinfections, beyond the increase of reinfections caused by the Omicron lineage, even for people who were infected by Omicron BA.1 due to increases in immune evasion, especially for the unvaccinated However, the observed escape of BA.4 and BA.5 from immunity by a BA.1 infection is more moderate than of BA.1 against studied prior cases of immunity (such as immunity from specific vaccines) [263] [264]\n\n\nBQ.1 and BQ.1.1\nSubvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were found in 2022, to be better at escaping first and booster vaccines than previous variants, and to have further reduced the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatments [267]\n\n\nLater subvariants\nLate in April 2024, CDC data showed KP.2 to be the most common U.S variant, with a quarter of all cases, just ahead of JN.1 KP1.1 represented 7 percent of U.S cases [223]  These two are sometimes referred to as the 'FLiRT' variants because they are characterized by a phenylalanine (F) to leucine (L) mutation and an arginine (R) to threonine (T) mutation in the virus's spike protein [224] By July 2024, a descendant of KP.2 with an extra amino acid change in the spike protein, Q493E, was given the names KP.3 and, informally, 'FLuQE,' and became a major variant in New South Wales during the Australian winter Initial research suggested that the Q493E change could help KP.3 be more effective at binding to human cells than KP.2 [225]\n\n\nTransmission\nIn January 2022, William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared the contagiousness of the Omicron variant to that of the measles [228]\n\n\nIn humans\nIn January 2022, William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, compared the contagiousness of the Omicron variant to that of the measles [228]\n\n\nIn non-human animals\nIn February 2022, the first confirmed case infecting a wild animal was confirmed by researchers at Pennsylvania State University in white-tailed deer in Staten Island, N.Y [241]\n\n\nSurfaces\nAlthough transmission via fomites is rare, preliminary data indicate that the variant lasts for 194 hours on plastic surfaces and 21 hours on skin, compared with just 56 and 7 hours, respectively, for the original strain [242] [243]\n\n\nVaccine effectiveness\nPfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccines provide reduced protection against asymptomatic disease but do reduce the risk of serious illness [244] [245] [246] On 22 December 2021, the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team reported an about 41% (95% CI, 37–45%) lower risk of a hospitalization requiring a stay of at least 1 night compared to the Delta variant, and that the data suggested that recipients of 2 doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech, the Moderna or the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine were substantially protected from hospitalization [247] In January 2022, results from Israel suggested that a fourth dose is only partially effective against Omicron Many cases of infection broke through, albeit \"a bit less than in the control group\", even though trial participants had higher antibody levels after the fourth dose [248] On 23 December 2021, Nature indicates that, though Omicron likely weakens vaccine protection, reasonable effectiveness against Omicron may be maintained with currently available vaccination and boosting approaches [249] [250]\n\n\nBA.1 and BA.2\nA January 2022 study by the UK Health Security Agency found that vaccines afforded similar levels of protection against symptomatic disease by BA.1 and BA.2, and in both it was considerably higher after two doses and a booster than two doses without booster, [261] [262] though because of the gradually waning effect of vaccines, further booster vaccination may later be necessary [166]\n\n\nBA.4 and BA.5\nIn May 2022, a preprint indicated Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 could cause a large share of COVID-19 reinfections, beyond the increase of reinfections caused by the Omicron lineage, even for people who were infected by Omicron BA.1 due to increases in immune evasion, especially for the unvaccinated However, the observed escape of BA.4 and BA.5 from immunity by a BA.1 infection is more moderate than of BA.1 against studied prior cases of immunity (such as immunity from specific vaccines) [263] [264]\n\n\nBQ.1 and BQ.1.1\nSubvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were found in 2022, to be better at escaping first and booster vaccines than previous variants, and to have further reduced the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody treatments [267]\n\n\nVaccine adjustments\nIn June 2022, Pfizer and Moderna developed bivalent vaccines to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and the Omicron variant The bivalent vaccines are well-tolerated and offer immunity to Omicron superior to previous mRNA vaccines [268] In September 2022, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the bivalent vaccines [269] [270] [271]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nLoss of taste and smell seem to be uncommon compared to other strains [5] [6] A unique reported symptom of the Omicron variant is night sweats, [7] [276] particularly with the BA.5 subvariant [277] [278] A study performed between 1 and 7 December 2021 by the Center for Disease Control found that: \"The most commonly reported symptoms  [were] cough, fatigue, and congestion or runny nose\" making it difficult to distinguish from a less damaging variant or another virus [279] Research published in London on 25 December 2021 suggested the most frequent symptoms stated by users of the Zoe Covid app were \"a runny nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats.\" [4]\n\n\nVirulence\nAs of 6 January 2022, Omicron multiplied around 70 times faster than the Delta variant in the bronchi (lung airways) but evidence suggested it is less severe than previous variants, especially compared to Delta, [281] [238] since it might be less able to penetrate deep lung tissue [282] As of January 2022, in southern California infections were 91 percent less fatal than the delta variant, with 51 percent less risk of hospitalization [283] However, the estimated difference in the intrinsic risk of hospitalization in England largely decreased to 0–30 percent, when reinfections were excluded [284]\n\n\nDiagnosis\n As of November 2021, the chance of detecting an Omicron case particularly depended on a country's sequencing rate, with South Africa sequencing far more samples than any other country in Africa, but at a considerably lower rate than most Western nations [287] [288] Sequencing the virus from a sample can take weeks limiting the early availability of data [289]\n\n\nPCR testing\nIn December 2021, the US FDA published guidelines on how PCR tests would be affected by Omicron [293] Tests that detect multiple gene targets were to continue to identify the testee as positive for COVID-19 S-gene dropout or target failure was proposed as a shorthand way of differentiating Omicron from Delta besides sequencing and genotyping [294]\n\n\nBA.1 and BA.2 differences\nAs of 7 December 2021 it was known that BA.2, unlike BA.1, lacks the characteristic S-gene target failure (SGTF) causing deletion (Δ69-70), by which many qPCR tests have been able to rapidly detect a case as an Omicron (or Alpha) variant, from the previously dominant Delta variant [298] [299] Thus, countries which primarily rely on SGTF for detection may overlook BA.2, [298] and British authorities consider SGTF alone as insufficient for monitoring the spread of Omicron [285] This has resulted in it having been nicknamed 'Stealth Omicron', [285] but because BA.2 still can be separated from other variants through normal full sequencing, or checks of certain other mutations, the nickname is not quite accurate [136] [300] As of January 2022, some countries, such as Denmark and Japan, have been using a variant qPCR which tests for several mutations, including L452R [295] [157] It can also distinguish Delta, which has L452R, [301] and all Omicron subvariants, which do not have L452R [302] [143] As Omicron became dominant and the Delta variant became rare in 2022, the SGTF mutation that had made Delta and BA.2 similar in qPCR tests was found to be useful for separating BA.1 and BA.2 from each other [303]\n\n\nTreatment\nAs of 28 November 2021, Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and IL6 receptor blockers such as tocilizumab (Actemra) were known to be effective for managing patients with the earlier strains of severe COVID-19 but the impact on the effectiveness of other treatments was being assessed [304] [305]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nOn 26 November 2021, the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases announced that 30,904 COVID-19-tests (in one day) detected 2,828 new COVID-19 infections (a 9.2% positivity rate) [311]\nOne week later, on 3 December 2021, the NICD announced that 65,990 COVID-19 tests had found 16,055 new infections (5.7 times as many as seven days before; positive rate 24.3%) and that 72 percent of them were found in Gauteng [312] [313]\nThis province of South Africa is densely populated at about 850 inhabitants per km2 Gauteng's capital Johannesburg is a megacity (about 5.5 million inhabitants in the city itself plus 9.5 million in the urban region) [citation needed]\n\n\nReported cases\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

These characters are used to write Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, and are an essential part of the Unicode Standard.\n\nBlock\n\nThe CJK Unified Ideographs block is a portion of the Unicode Standard, which is a character encoding standard that aims to map characters from various writing systems to unique numerical codes. The block is defined by the Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organization that oversees the development and maintenance of the Unicode Standard.\n\nThe CJK Unified Ideographs block is one of the largest blocks in the Unicode Standard, containing a total of 20,922 characters. These characters are used to represent the characters in the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages, as well as some characters in other languages that use CJK characters.\n\nThe block is organized into several ranges, each containing a specific set of characters. The ranges are defined by the Unicode Consortium based on the language and script of the characters.\n\n**Ranges in the CJK Unified Ideographs block**\n\nThe CJK Unified Ideographs block is divided into several ranges, each containing a specific set of characters. The ranges are as follows:\n\n* CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A: U+4E00 to U+9FFF (20,971 characters)\n* CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B: U+3400 to U+4DBF (6,582 characters)\n* CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C: U+20000 to U+2A6DF (6,582 characters)\n* CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D: U+2A700 to U+2B73F (1,440 characters)\n\nHistory\n\nThe CJK Unified Ideographs block has a long history that dates back to the early days of the Unicode Standard. The first version of the Unicode Standard, released in 1991, included a limited set of CJK characters. Over the years, the Unicode Consortium has expanded the set of CJK characters in the Unicode Standard, adding new characters and ranges to the block.\n\nIn 1993, the Unicode Consortium released Version 1.1 of the Unicode Standard, which included a larger set of CJK characters. This version of the Unicode Standard introduced the concept of a unified ideographic block, which combined the characters of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages into a single block.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Unicode Consortium released several updates to the Unicode Standard, which added new CJK characters and ranges to the block. These updates included the introduction of the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, which added 20,971 new characters to the block.\n\nIn 2010, the Unicode Consortium released Version 5.2 of the Unicode Standard, which added several new CJK characters and ranges to the block. This version of the Unicode Standard introduced the concept of CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, which added 6,582 new characters to the block.\n\nIn 2018, the Unicode Consortium released Version 11.0 of the Unicode Standard, which added several new CJK characters and ranges to the block. This version of the Unicode Standard introduced the concept of CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, which added 1,440 new characters to the block.\n\n**Evolution of the CJK Unified Ideographs block**\n\nThe CJK Unified Ideographs block has undergone significant changes since its introduction in the early days of the Unicode Standard. The block has expanded from a small set of characters to a large block containing 20,922 characters.\n\nThe block has also undergone several updates and revisions, which have added new characters and ranges to the block. These updates have improved the accuracy and completeness of the block, making it a valuable resource for users of the Unicode Standard.\n\n**Impact of the CJK Unified Ideographs block**\n\nThe CJK Unified Ideographs block has had a significant impact on the development and use of the Unicode Standard. The block has enabled the accurate and efficient representation of CJK characters in a wide range of applications, including text processing, font rendering, and input methods.\n\nThe block has also facilitated the development of new languages and writing systems, which have used the CJK characters as a basis for their own scripts. The block has also enabled the creation of new fonts and input methods, which have improved the usability and accessibility of CJK languages.\n\nIn conclusion, the CJK Unified Ideographs block is a critical component of the Unicode Standard, and has played a significant role in the development and use of CJK languages.

{"title": "El_Salvador", "content": "\nEtymology\nAfter the Spanish conquest, the land was divided into the province of San Salvador, which means \"Holy Savior\"; a Spanish title for Jesus From 1579 that also including the province of San Miguel (Saint Michael) San Salvador would become, throughout the colonial era, an alcaldía mayor (great mayor's office), intendancy, and finally a province with a provincial council, and the province of Izalcos (which would become be called the mayor's office of Sonsonate) In 1824 the two jurisdictions were united in the State of Salvador, a part of the Federal Republic of Central America [26] [27]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the Pleistocene El Salvador was inhabited by now extinct megafauna species, including the elephant-sized giant ground sloth Eremotherium, the rhinoceros-like Mixotoxodon, the gomphothere (elephant-relative) Cuvieronius, the glyptodont Glyptotherium, the llama Hemiauchenia, and the horse Equus conversidens [29] [30] El Salvador has likely been occupied by humans since the  Paleoindian period, based on fluted stone points found in western El Salvador [31]\n\n\nPrehistoric\nDuring the Pleistocene El Salvador was inhabited by now extinct megafauna species, including the elephant-sized giant ground sloth Eremotherium, the rhinoceros-like Mixotoxodon, the gomphothere (elephant-relative) Cuvieronius, the glyptodont Glyptotherium, the llama Hemiauchenia, and the horse Equus conversidens [29] [30] El Salvador has likely been occupied by humans since the  Paleoindian period, based on fluted stone points found in western El Salvador [31]\n\n\nPre-Columbian\nArchaeological knowledge of Pre-Columbian civilisation in El Salvador is poor, due to its high population density limiting excavation, as well as volcanic eruptions blanketing potential archaeological sites This lack of knowledge particularly effects the Preclassic Period and earlier [32]\n\n\nEuropean arrival (1522)\nBy 1521, the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the smallpox epidemic that was spreading throughout the territory, although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatlán or the northern portion Managuara [41] [42] [43] The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory was made by the admiral Andrés Niño, who led an expedition to Central America He disembarked in the Gulf of Fonseca on 31 May 1522, at Meanguera island, naming it Petronila, [44] and then traversed to Jiquilisco Bay on the mouth of Lempa River The first indigenous people to have contact with the Spanish were the Lenca of eastern El Salvador.\n\n\nConquest of Cuzcatlán and Managuara\nIn 1524, after participating in the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Pedro de Alvarado, his brother Gonzalo, and their men crossed the Rio Paz southward into Cuzcatlec territory Upon their arrival, Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the Pipil had little gold compared to what they had found in Guatemala or Mexico The small amount of gold that was available had to be panned so that it could be obtained Eventually, the Spaniards recognized the richness of the land's volcanic soil Following this discovery, the Spanish crown began granting land based on the terms of the encomienda system [45]\n\n\nColonial period (1525–1821)\nDuring the colonial period, San Salvador and San Miguel were part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala (Spanish: Reino de Guatemala), created in 1609 as an administrative division of New Spain The Salvadoran territory was administered by the mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an intendencia in 1786.\n\n\nIndependence (1821)\nIn 1821, in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Act of Independence of Central America, which released all of the Captaincy General of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas) from Spanish rule and declared its independence In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America.\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1898, General Tomas Regalado gained power by force, deposing Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez and ruling as president until 1903 Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was killed on 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro, during a war against Guatemala Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent When President Manuel Enrique Araujo was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n\nLa Matanza\nBeginning in January 1932, there was brutal suppression of a rural revolt known as La Matanza In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Martí helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a communist alternative to the Red Cross, called \"International Red Aid\", serving as one of its representatives Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of Marxist–Leninist ideology In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled because of his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for president the following year Once Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador and, along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n\nSalvadoran Civil War (1979–1992)\nOn 15 October 1979, a coup d'état brought the Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) to power It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed agrarian reform, and a junta formed with young reformist elements from the army such as Colonels Adolfo Arnoldo Majano and Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez, [59] [60] as well as with progressives such as Guillermo Ungo and Alvarez.\n\n\nPost-war (1992–2019)\nThe so-called Chapultepec Peace Accords mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defence, a paramilitary group A new Civil Police was to be organized Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a Commission on the Truth for El Salvador (Comisión de la Verdad Para El Salvador), which would \"investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the nature and effects of the violence, and...recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation\" In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict [65] Five days later the Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period.\n\n\nPresidency of Nayib Bukele (2019–present)\nOn 1 June 2019, Nayib Bukele became the new president of El Salvador [72] Bukele was the winner of February 2019 presidential election He represented GANA, as he was denied participating with the newly formed Nuevas Ideas party ARENA and the FMLN, El Salvador's two main parties, had dominated politics in El Salvador over the past three decades [73]\n\n\nGeography\nEl Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes 13° and 15°N, and longitudes 87° and 91°W It stretches 270 km (168 mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast and 142 km (88 mi) north to south, with a total area of 21,041 km2 (8,124 sq mi) As the smallest and most densely populated country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called Pulgarcito de America (the \"Tom Thumb of the Americas\") El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, as well as a coastline with the Pacific Ocean The total national boundary length is 546 km (339 mi): 203 km (126 mi) with Guatemala and 343 km (213 mi) with Honduras It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline The coastline on the Pacific is 307 km (191 mi) long.\n\n\nClimate\nEl Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons [95] Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change [95] The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot and humid; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate [95]\n\n\nNatural disasters\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the El Niño and La Niña effects [96] Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\n\nExtreme weather events\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the El Niño and La Niña effects [96] Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\n\nEarthquakes and volcanic activity\nEl Salvador lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity, including frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors Recent examples include the earthquake on 13 January 2001 that measured 7.7 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a landslide that killed more than 800 people; [99] and another earthquake only a month later, on 13 February 2001, that killed 255 people and damaged about 20% of the country's housing A 5.7 Mw earthquake in 1986 resulted in 1,500 deaths, 10,000 injuries, and 100,000 people left homeless [100] [101]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe 1983 constitution has the highest legal authority in the country El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n\n\nPolitics\nEl Salvador has a multi-party system Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of Mauricio Funes of the FMLN in March 2009 The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant Marxist-Leninist faction in the legislature, and the social liberal wing led by Mauricio Funes until 2014 However, the two-party dominance was broken after Nayib Bukele, a candidate from GANA won the 2019 Salvadoran presidential election [106] In February 2021, the results of legislative election caused a major change in the politics of El Salvador The new allied party of president Nayib Bukele, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) won the biggest congressional majority in the country's history [76]\n\n\nForeign relations and military\nEl Salvador is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies It is also member of the Organization of American States, the Central American Parliament, and the Central American Integration System among others It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission, which seeks to promote regional arms control El Salvador is a member of the World Trade Organization and is pursuing regional free trade agreements An active participant in the Summit of the Americas process, El Salvador chairs a working group on market access under the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative.\n\n\nHuman rights\nAmnesty International has drawn attention to several arrests of police officers for unlawful police killings Other issues to gain Amnesty International's attention include missing children, failure of law enforcement to properly investigate and prosecute crimes against women, and rendering organized labour illegal [113]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEl Salvador is divided into 14 departments (departamentos), which in turn are subdivided into 44 municipalities (municipios) which are also divided into 262 districts.\n\n\nEconomy\nEl Salvador's economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies, and by official corruption Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012, the International Monetary Fund suspended a $750 million loan to the central government President Funes' chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, acknowledged that the economy was at the \"point of collapse\" [118]\n\n\nEnergy\nEl Salvador's energy industry is diversified across, relying on fossil fuels, hydro, other renewables (mainly geothermal) for local electricity production, along with a reliance on imports for oil El Salvador has an installed capacity of 1,983 MW generating 5,830 GWh of electricity per year, 84% of this comes from renewable sources including 26.85% from geothermal (produced from the country's many volcanoes), 29.92% from hydro and the rest is from fossil fuels [140] [141]\n\n\nTelecommunications and media\nEl Salvador has 900,000 fixed telephone lines, 500,000 fixed broadband lines and 9.4 million mobile cellular subscriptions [144] Much of the population is able to access the internet through their smartphones and mobile networks, which liberal government regulation promotes mobile penetration over fixed line including the deployment of 5G coverage (which testing of began in 2020) [144] Transition to digital transmission of TV/radio networks was done in 2018 with the adaptation of the ISDB-T standard There are hundreds of privately owned national TV networks, cable TV networks (that also carry international channels), and radio stations available; while there is also 1 government owned broadcast station [144]\n\n\nOfficial corruption and foreign investment\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government [citation needed] Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"Ease of doing business\" index [145]\n\n\nTourism\nIt was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists visited El Salvador in 2014 Tourism contributed US$2970.1 million to El Salvador's GDP in 2019 This represented 11% of total GDP [150] Tourism directly supported 80,500 jobs in 2013 This represented 3.1% of total employment in El Salvador In 2019, tourism indirectly supported 317,200 jobs, representing 11.6% of total employment in El Salvador [150]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe level of access to water supply and sanitation has been increased significantly A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas [154] However, water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any treatment Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years.\n\n\nDemographics\nEl Salvador's population was 6,314,167 in 2021, [160] [161] compared to 2,200,000 in 1950 In 2010 the percentage of the population below the age of 15 was 32.1%, 61% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% were 65 years or older [162] The capital city of San Salvador has a population of about 2.1 million people An estimated 42% of El Salvador's population live in rural areas Urbanization has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s, with millions moving to the cities and creating associated problems for urban planning and services.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAround 86% percent of Salvadorans identify as mestizo, or mixed Amerindian and European descent, 12.7% identify as being of full European ancestry, 0.1% identify as Afro-descended while about 0.6% do not identify with any of the aforementioned categories [2]\n\n\nLanguages\nSpanish is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants, although a very small number (around 500) of indigenous Pipils speak Nawat The other indigenous languages, namely Poqomam, Cacaopera, and Lenca, are extinct Q'eqchi' is spoken by indigenous immigrants of Guatemalan and Belizean origin living in El Salvador.\n\n\nReligion\nThe majority of the population in El Salvador is Christian Catholics (43.3%) and Protestants (33.9%) are the two major religious groups in the country, with the Catholic Church the largest denomination [174] Those not affiliated with any religious group amount to 18.6% of the population [174] The remaining is that of 3% Jehovah's Witnesses, Hare Krishnas, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Latter-day Saints, and those adhering to indigenous religious beliefs, and 1.2% being made up of those who identify as agnostic or atheist  [174] The number of evangelicals in the country is growing rapidly [175] Óscar Romero, the first Salvadoran saint, was canonized by Pope Francis on 14 October 2018.\n\n\nEducation\nThe public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education [176]\n\n\nCrime\nSince the early twenty-first century, El Salvador has experienced high crime rates, including gang-related crimes and juvenile delinquency [180] El Salvador had the highest murder rate in the world in 2012 but experienced a sharp decline in 2019 with a new conservative government in power [181] [182] It is also considered an epicentre of a gang crisis, along with Guatemala and Honduras [183] Several journalistic investigations indicate that the government administrations of Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena [184] and Salvador Sánchez Cerén, [185] far from working to eradicate violence and the actions of gang groups, made truces with the gangs Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha [186] to keep a certain control over criminal activities and murders in the Salvadoran territory In response to this, the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership; so far its efforts have not produced any quick results One of the government programs was a gang reform called \"Super Mano Dura\" (Super Firm Hand) Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the United Nations It experienced temporary success in 2004 but there was a rise in crime after 2005 In 2004, there were 41 intentional homicides per 100,000 citizens, with 60% of the homicides committed being gang-related [183] In 2012, the homicide rate had increased to 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than triple the rate in Mexico [187] [188] [189] In 2011 there were an estimated 25,000 gang members at large in El Salvador, with another 9,000 in prison [187] The most well-known gangs, called \"maras\" in colloquial Spanish, are Mara Salvatrucha and their rivals Barrio 18 Maras are hunted by death squads including Sombra Negra [190]\n\n\n2022 crackdown on gangs\nBeginning on 25 March 2022, three days of gang-related violence occurred that left 87 people dead [199] In response, President Bukele asked the Salvadoran parliament to ratify a state of emergency [200] On 26 March, Bukele also ordered the police and army to initiate mass-arrests against those responsible for the violence.\n\n\nCulture\nPulling from indigenous, colonial Spanish and African influences, a composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the natives, European settlers, and enslaved Africans The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture Archbishop Óscar Romero is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War [202] Significant

Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach The name pupusa comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, pupushahua The origins of the pupusa are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards [203]\n\n\nMusic\nTraditional Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences It includes

English about \"El_Salvador\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nAfter the Spanish conquest, the land was divided into the province of San Salvador, which means \"Holy Savior\"; a Spanish title for Jesus From 1579 that also including the province of San Miguel (Saint Michael) San Salvador would become, throughout the colonial era, an alcaldía mayor (great mayor's office), intendancy, and finally a province with a provincial council, and the province of Izalcos (which would become be called the mayor's office of Sonsonate) In 1824 the two jurisdictions were united in the State of Salvador, a part of the Federal Republic of Central America [26] [27]\n\n\nHistory\nDuring the Pleistocene El Salvador was inhabited by now extinct megafauna species, including the elephant-sized giant ground sloth Eremotherium, the rhinoceros-like Mixotoxodon, the gomphothere (elephant-relative) Cuvieronius, the glyptodont Glyptotherium, the llama Hemiauchenia, and the horse Equus conversidens [29] [30] El Salvador has likely been occupied by humans since the  Paleoindian period, based on fluted stone points found in western El Salvador [31]\n\n\nPrehistoric\nDuring the Pleistocene El Salvador was inhabited by now extinct megafauna species, including the elephant-sized giant ground sloth Eremotherium, the rhinoceros-like Mixotoxodon, the gomphothere (elephant-relative) Cuvieronius, the glyptodont Glyptotherium, the llama Hemiauchenia, and the horse Equus conversidens [29] [30] El Salvador has likely been occupied by humans since the  Paleoindian period, based on fluted stone points found in western El Salvador [31]\n\n\nPre-Columbian\nArchaeological knowledge of Pre-Columbian civilisation in El Salvador is poor, due to its high population density limiting excavation, as well as volcanic eruptions blanketing potential archaeological sites This lack of knowledge particularly effects the Preclassic Period and earlier [32]\n\n\nEuropean arrival (1522)\nBy 1521, the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the smallpox epidemic that was spreading throughout the territory, although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatlán or the northern portion Managuara [41] [42] [43] The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory was made by the admiral Andrés Niño, who led an expedition to Central America He disembarked in the Gulf of Fonseca on 31 May 1522, at Meanguera island, naming it Petronila, [44] and then traversed to Jiquilisco Bay on the mouth of Lempa River The first indigenous people to have contact with the Spanish were the Lenca of eastern El Salvador.\n\n\nConquest of Cuzcatlán and Managuara\nIn 1524, after participating in the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Pedro de Alvarado, his brother Gonzalo, and their men crossed the Rio Paz southward into Cuzcatlec territory Upon their arrival, Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the Pipil had little gold compared to what they had found in Guatemala or Mexico The small amount of gold that was available had to be panned so that it could be obtained Eventually, the Spaniards recognized the richness of the land's volcanic soil Following this discovery, the Spanish crown began granting land based on the terms of the encomienda system [45]\n\n\nColonial period (1525–1821)\nDuring the colonial period, San Salvador and San Miguel were part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala (Spanish: Reino de Guatemala), created in 1609 as an administrative division of New Spain The Salvadoran territory was administered by the mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an intendencia in 1786.\n\n\nIndependence (1821)\nIn 1821, in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Act of Independence of Central America, which released all of the Captaincy General of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas) from Spanish rule and declared its independence In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America.\n\n\n20th century\nIn 1898, General Tomas Regalado gained power by force, deposing Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez and ruling as president until 1903 Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was killed on 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro, during a war against Guatemala Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent When President Manuel Enrique Araujo was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.\n\n\nLa Matanza\nBeginning in January 1932, there was brutal suppression of a rural revolt known as La Matanza In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Martí helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a communist alternative to the Red Cross, called \"International Red Aid\", serving as one of its representatives Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of Marxist–Leninist ideology In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled because of his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for president the following year Once Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador and, along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, began the movement that was later truncated by the military.\n\n\nSalvadoran Civil War (1979–1992)\nOn 15 October 1979, a coup d'état brought the Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) to power It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed agrarian reform, and a junta formed with young reformist elements from the army such as Colonels Adolfo Arnoldo Majano and Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez, [59] [60] as well as with progressives such as Guillermo Ungo and Alvarez.\n\n\nPost-war (1992–2019)\nThe so-called Chapultepec Peace Accords mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defence, a paramilitary group A new Civil Police was to be organized Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a Commission on the Truth for El Salvador (Comisión de la Verdad Para El Salvador), which would \"investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the nature and effects of the violence, and...recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation\" In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict [65] Five days later the Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period.\n\n\nPresidency of Nayib Bukele (2019–present)\nOn 1 June 2019, Nayib Bukele became the new president of El Salvador [72] Bukele was the winner of February 2019 presidential election He represented GANA, as he was denied participating with the newly formed Nuevas Ideas party ARENA and the FMLN, El Salvador's two main parties, had dominated politics in El Salvador over the past three decades [73]\n\n\nGeography\nEl Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes 13° and 15°N, and longitudes 87° and 91°W It stretches 270 km (168 mi) from west-northwest to east-southeast and 142 km (88 mi) north to south, with a total area of 21,041 km2 (8,124 sq mi) As the smallest and most densely populated country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called Pulgarcito de America (the \"Tom Thumb of the Americas\") El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, as well as a coastline with the Pacific Ocean The total national boundary length is 546 km (339 mi): 203 km (126 mi) with Guatemala and 343 km (213 mi) with Honduras It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline The coastline on the Pacific is 307 km (191 mi) long.\n\n\nClimate\nEl Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons [95] Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change [95] The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot and humid; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate [95]\n\n\nNatural disasters\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the El Niño and La Niña effects [96] Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\n\nExtreme weather events\nEl Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the El Niño and La Niña effects [96] Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch, which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.\n\n\nEarthquakes and volcanic activity\nEl Salvador lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity, including frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors Recent examples include the earthquake on 13 January 2001 that measured 7.7 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a landslide that killed more than 800 people; [99] and another earthquake only a month later, on 13 February 2001, that killed 255 people and damaged about 20% of the country's housing A 5.7 Mw earthquake in 1986 resulted in 1,500 deaths, 10,000 injuries, and 100,000 people left homeless [100] [101]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nIt is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe 1983 constitution has the highest legal authority in the country El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:\n\n\nPolitics\nEl Salvador has a multi-party system Two political parties, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of Mauricio Funes of the FMLN in March 2009 The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant Marxist-Leninist faction in the legislature, and the social liberal wing led by Mauricio Funes until 2014 However, the two-party dominance was broken after Nayib Bukele, a candidate from GANA won the 2019 Salvadoran presidential election [106] In February 2021, the results of legislative election caused a major change in the politics of El Salvador The new allied party of president Nayib Bukele, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) won the biggest congressional majority in the country's history [76]\n\n\nForeign relations and military\nEl Salvador is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies It is also member of the Organization of American States, the Central American Parliament, and the Central American Integration System among others It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission, which seeks to promote regional arms control El Salvador is a member of the World Trade Organization and is pursuing regional free trade agreements An active participant in the Summit of the Americas process, El Salvador chairs a working group on market access under the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative.\n\n\nHuman rights\nAmnesty International has drawn attention to several arrests of police officers for unlawful police killings Other issues to gain Amnesty International's attention include missing children, failure of law enforcement to properly investigate and prosecute crimes against women, and rendering organized labour illegal [113]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEl Salvador is divided into 14 departments (departamentos), which in turn are subdivided into 44 municipalities (municipios) which are also divided into 262 districts.\n\n\nEconomy\nEl Salvador's economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies, and by official corruption Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012, the International Monetary Fund suspended a $750 million loan to the central government President Funes' chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, acknowledged that the economy was at the \"point of collapse\" [118]\n\n\nEnergy\nEl Salvador's energy industry is diversified across, relying on fossil fuels, hydro, other renewables (mainly geothermal) for local electricity production, along with a reliance on imports for oil El Salvador has an installed capacity of 1,983 MW generating 5,830 GWh of electricity per year, 84% of this comes from renewable sources including 26.85% from geothermal (produced from the country's many volcanoes), 29.92% from hydro and the rest is from fossil fuels [140] [141]\n\n\nTelecommunications and media\nEl Salvador has 900,000 fixed telephone lines, 500,000 fixed broadband lines and 9.4 million mobile cellular subscriptions [144] Much of the population is able to access the internet through their smartphones and mobile networks, which liberal government regulation promotes mobile penetration over fixed line including the deployment of 5G coverage (which testing of began in 2020) [144] Transition to digital transmission of TV/radio networks was done in 2018 with the adaptation of the ISDB-T standard There are hundreds of privately owned national TV networks, cable TV networks (that also carry international channels), and radio stations available; while there is also 1 government owned broadcast station [144]\n\n\nOfficial corruption and foreign investment\nIn an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government [citation needed] Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual \"Ease of doing business\" index [145]\n\n\nTourism\nIt was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists visited El Salvador in 2014 Tourism contributed US$2970.1 million to El Salvador's GDP in 2019 This represented 11% of total GDP [150] Tourism directly supported 80,500 jobs in 2013 This represented 3.1% of total employment in El Salvador In 2019, tourism indirectly supported 317,200 jobs, representing 11.6% of total employment in El Salvador [150]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThe level of access to water supply and sanitation has been increased significantly A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas [154] However, water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any treatment Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years.\n\n\nDemographics\nEl Salvador's population was 6,314,167 in 2021, [160] [161] compared to 2,200,000 in 1950 In 2010 the percentage of the population below the age of 15 was 32.1%, 61% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% were 65 years or older [162] The capital city of San Salvador has a population of about 2.1 million people An estimated 42% of El Salvador's population live in rural areas Urbanization has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s, with millions moving to the cities and creating associated problems for urban planning and services.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAround 86% percent of Salvadorans identify as mestizo, or mixed Amerindian and European descent, 12.7% identify as being of full European ancestry, 0.1% identify as Afro-descended while about 0.6% do not identify with any of the aforementioned categories [2]\n\n\nLanguages\nSpanish is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants, although a very small number (around 500) of indigenous Pipils speak Nawat The other indigenous languages, namely Poqomam, Cacaopera, and Lenca, are extinct Q'eqchi' is spoken by indigenous immigrants of Guatemalan and Belizean origin living in El Salvador.\n\n\nReligion\nThe majority of the population in El Salvador is Christian Catholics (43.3%) and Protestants (33.9%) are the two major religious groups in the country, with the Catholic Church the largest denomination [174] Those not affiliated with any religious group amount to 18.6% of the population [174] The remaining is that of 3% Jehovah's Witnesses, Hare Krishnas, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Latter-day Saints, and those adhering to indigenous religious beliefs, and 1.2% being made up of those who identify as agnostic or atheist  [174] The number of evangelicals in the country is growing rapidly [175] Óscar Romero, the first Salvadoran saint, was canonized by Pope Francis on 14 October 2018.\n\n\nEducation\nThe public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education [176]\n\n\nCrime\nSince the early twenty-first century, El Salvador has experienced high crime rates, including gang-related crimes and juvenile delinquency [180] El Salvador had the highest murder rate in the world in 2012 but experienced a sharp decline in 2019 with a new conservative government in power [181] [182] It is also considered an epicentre of a gang crisis, along with Guatemala and Honduras [183] Several journalistic investigations indicate that the government administrations of Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena [184] and Salvador Sánchez Cerén, [185] far from working to eradicate violence and the actions of gang groups, made truces with the gangs Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha [186] to keep a certain control over criminal activities and murders in the Salvadoran territory In response to this, the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership; so far its efforts have not produced any quick results One of the government programs was a gang reform called \"Super Mano Dura\" (Super Firm Hand) Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the United Nations It experienced temporary success in 2004 but there was a rise in crime after 2005 In 2004, there were 41 intentional homicides per 100,000 citizens, with 60% of the homicides committed being gang-related [183] In 2012, the homicide rate had increased to 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than triple the rate in Mexico [187] [188] [189] In 2011 there were an estimated 25,000 gang members at large in El Salvador, with another 9,000 in prison [187] The most well-known gangs, called \"maras\" in colloquial Spanish, are Mara Salvatrucha and their rivals Barrio 18 Maras are hunted by death squads including Sombra Negra [190]\n\n\n2022 crackdown on gangs\nBeginning on 25 March 2022, three days of gang-related violence occurred that left 87 people dead [199] In response, President Bukele asked the Salvadoran parliament to ratify a state of emergency [200] On 26 March, Bukele also ordered the police and army to initiate mass-arrests against those responsible for the violence.\n\n\nCulture\nPulling from indigenous, colonial Spanish and African influences, a composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the natives, European settlers, and enslaved Africans The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture Archbishop Óscar Romero is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War [202] Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the Jesuit priests and professors Ignacio Ellacuría, Ignacio Martín-Baró, and Segundo Montes, who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.\n\n\nCuisine\nOne of El Salvador's notable dishes is the pupusa Pupusas are handmade corn tortillas (made of masa de maíz or masa de arroz, a maize or rice flour dough used in Latin American cuisine) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as quesillo, similar to mozzarella), chicharrón, or refried beans Sometimes the filling is queso con loroco (cheese combined with loroco, a vine flower bud native to Central America) [203] Pupusas revueltas are pupusas filled with beans, cheese and pork There are also vegetarian options Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach The name pupusa comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, pupushahua The origins of the pupusa are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards [203]\n\n\nMusic\nTraditional Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences It includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays, especially feast days of the saints) Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and cancione which are composed of parading bands, street performances, or onstage dances, either in groups or paired Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common Traditional instruments used are the marimba, tepehuaste, flutes, drums, scrapers and gourds, as well as guitars among others El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as Xuc which originated in Cojutepeque, Cuscatlan Caribbean, Colombian, and Mexican music has become customary listening radio and party in the country, especially boleros, cumbia, merengue, Latin pop, salsa, bachata, and reggaeton.\n\n\nSport\nFootball is the most popular sport in El Salvador The El Salvador national football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1970 and 1982 Their qualification for the 1970 tournament was marred by the Football War, a war against Honduras, whose team El Salvador's had defeated The national football team play at the Estadio Cuscatlán in San Salvador It opened in 1976 and seats 53,400, making it the largest stadium in Central America and the

He was known for his versatility and range, and was often typecast as a rugged, everyman character. Paxton's early life, acting and filmmaking career, music, personal life, death, and tributes are all notable aspects of his life and legacy.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBill Paxton was born on May 17, 1955, in Fort Worth, Texas, to Mary Lou (née Gray) and John Lane Paxton. His mother was a Catholic who raised him and his siblings in her faith, and his father was a businessman and lumber wholesaler. Paxton's great-great-grandfather, Elisha Franklin Paxton, was a brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Paxton grew up in a close-knit family and was raised with strong values and a strong sense of community.\n\n**Career**\n\nPaxton's acting career began in the early 1980s, when he appeared in a number of low-budget films and television shows. One of his earliest roles was as a mortuary assistant in the 1983 film \"Mortuary.\" He also appeared in the 1984 film \"The Terminator,\" where he played a minor role as a punk. Paxton's breakthrough role came in 1985, when he played the lead protagonist's bullying older brother in John Hughes's \"Weird Science.\" He also appeared in the 1986 film \"Aliens,\" where he played the role of Private William Hudson.\n\n**Acting and Filmmaking**\n\nThroughout his career, Paxton appeared in a wide range of films, including \"Near Dark,\" \"Twister,\" and \"Titanic.\" He also directed several films, including \"Frailty\" and \"The Greatest Game Ever Played.\" Paxton was known for his ability to take on a variety of roles, from dramatic to comedic, and his willingness to take risks and try new things.\n\n**Music**\n\nIn 1982, Paxton and his friend Andrew Todd Rosenthal formed a new wave musical band called Martini Ranch. The band released its only full-length album, \"Holy Cow,\" in 1988 on Sire Records. The album was produced by Devo member Bob Casale, and featured guest appearances by two other members of that band. The music video for the band's single \"Reach\" was directed by James Cameron.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPaxton was married to Kelly Rowan in 1979, but the marriage ended in divorce a year later. He later met Louise Newbury on the Number 37 bus in Twickenham, London, where she was a student, and they were married in 1987. They lived in Ojai, California, and had two children: son James, who also became an actor, and daughter Lydia.\n\n**Death and Lawsuit**\n\nIn early 2017, Paxton underwent open-heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to repair a damaged aortic heart valve and correct an aortic aneurysm. A day later, he underwent an emergency second surgery to repair a damaged coronary artery. His condition deteriorated over the following 10 days, and he died of a stroke on February 25, 2017, at the age of 61.\n\n**Tributes**\n\nMany dozens of filmmakers and actors across the entertainment spectrum paid tribute to Paxton in the aftermath of his death. Close friend and frequent collaborator James Cameron wrote a tribute in an article for Vanity Fair, detailing their 36-year friendship and expressing regret over the projects they would not be able to make together. The 2017 film \"Call Me by Your Name\" was dedicated to Paxton's memory, and the 2019 John Travolta film \"The Fanatic\" was dedicated to him. Paxton's son James would later play a younger version of his father's S.H.I.E.L.D. character in the final season of the show, which served as a tribute to his role in the series.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n**Film**\n\n* Mortuary (1983)\n* The Terminator (1984)\n* Weird Science (1985)\n* Aliens (1986)\n* Near Dark (1987)\n* Twister (1996)\n* Titanic (1997)\n* Frailty (2001)\n* The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005)\n* Boardwalk Empire (2010-2014)\n* Edge of Tomorrow (2014)\n* Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

{"title": "The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_(song)", "content": "\nLyrics\n\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses There are twelve verses, each describing a gift given by \"my true love\" on one of the twelve days of Christmas.\nThere are many variations in the lyrics The lyrics given here are from Frederic Austin's 1909 publication that established the current form of the carol [3] The first three verses run, in full, as follows:\n\n\nVariations of the lyrics\nThe earliest known publications of the words to \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" were an illustrated children's book, Mirth Without Mischief, published in London in 1780, and a  broadsheet by Angus, of Newcastle, dated to the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries [4] [5]\n\n\nScotland\nA similar cumulative verse from Scotland, \"The Yule Days\", has been likened to \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" in the scholarly literature [20] It has thirteen days rather than twelve, and the number of gifts does not increase in the manner of \"The Twelve Days\"  Its final verse, as published in Chambers, Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland (1842), runs as follows: [29]\n\n\nFaroe Islands\nIn the Faroe Islands, there is a comparable counting Christmas song The gifts include: one feather, two geese, three sides of meat, four sheep, five cows, six oxen, seven dishes, eight ponies, nine banners, ten barrels, eleven goats, twelve men, thirteen hides, fourteen rounds of cheese and fifteen deer [32] These were illustrated in 1994 by local cartoonist Óli Petersen (born 1936) on a series of two stamps issued by the Faroese Philatelic Office [33]\n\n\nSweden\nIn Blekinge and Småland, southern Sweden, a similar song was also sung It featured one hen, two barley seeds, three grey geese, four pounds of pork, six flayed sheep, a sow with six pigs, seven åtting grain, eight grey foals with golden saddles, nine newly born cows, ten pairs of oxen, eleven clocks, and finally twelve churches, each with twelve altars, each with twelve priests, each with twelve capes, each with twelve coin-purses, each with twelve daler inside [34] [35]\n\n\nFrance\n\"Les Douze Mois\" (\"The Twelve Months\") (also known as \"La Perdriole\"—\"The Partridge\") [36] is another similar cumulative verse from France that has been likened to The Twelve Days of Christmas [20] Its final verse, as published in de Coussemaker, Chants Populaires des Flamands de France (1856), runs as follows: [37]\n\n\nHistory and meaning\nThe exact origins and the meaning of the song are unknown, but it is highly probable that it originated from a children's memory and forfeit game [42]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe exact origins and the meaning of the song are unknown, but it is highly probable that it originated from a children's memory and forfeit game [42]\n\n\nManner of performance\nMany early sources suggest that The Twelve Days of Christmas was a \"memory-and-forfeits\" game, in which participants were required to repeat a verse of poetry recited by the leader Players who made an error were required to pay a penalty, in the form of offering a kiss or confection [52]\n\n\nMeanings of the gifts\nAn anonymous \"antiquarian\", writing in 1867, speculated that \"pear-tree\" is a corruption of French perdrix ( [pɛʁ.dʁi], \"partridge\") [18]  This was also suggested by Anne Gilchrist, who observed in 1916 that \"from the constancy in English, French, and Languedoc versions of the 'merry little partridge,' I suspect that 'pear-tree' is really perdrix (Old French pertriz) carried into England\" [55]  The variant text \"part of a juniper tree\", found as early as c 1840, is likely not original, since \"partridge\" is found in the French versions [11] [48] It is probably a corruption of \"partridge in a pear tree\", though Gilchrist suggests \"juniper tree\" could have been joli perdrix,  [pretty partridge] [56] [55]\n\n\nPartridge in a pear tree\nAn anonymous \"antiquarian\", writing in 1867, speculated that \"pear-tree\" is a corruption of French perdrix ( [pɛʁ.dʁi], \"partridge\") [18]  This was also suggested by Anne Gilchrist, who observed in 1916 that \"from the constancy in English, French, and Languedoc versions of the 'merry little partridge,' I suspect that 'pear-tree' is really perdrix

[11] [48] It is probably a corruption of \"partridge in a pear tree\", though Gilchrist suggests \"juniper tree\" could have been joli perdrix,  [pretty partridge] [56] [55]\n\n\nFrench hens\nGilchrist suggests that the adjective \"French\" may mean \"foreign\" [55]  Sharp reports that one singer sings \"Britten chains\", which he interprets as a corruption of \"Breton hens\" [58]  William and Ceil Baring-Gould also suggest that the birds are Breton hens, which they see as another indication that the carol is of French origin [59]\n\n\nColly birds\nThe word \"colly\", found in the earliest publications, was the source of considerable confusion [60]  Multiple sources confirm that it is a dialectal word, found in Somerset and elsewhere, meaning \"black\", [61] so \"colly birds\" are blackbirds [14] [55]  Despite this, other theories about the word's origin are also found in the literature, such as that the word is a corruption of French collet (\"ruff\"), or of \"coloured\" [18] [47]\n\n\nGold rings\nShahn suggests that \"the five golden rings refer to the ringed pheasant\" [62] William and Ceil Baring-Gould reiterate this idea, which implies that the gifts for first seven days are all birds [59] Others suggest the gold rings refer to \"five goldspinks\"—a goldspink being an old name for a goldfinch; [63] or even canaries [a] However, the 1780 publication includes an illustration that clearly depicts the \"five gold rings\" as being jewellery [4]\n\n\nGeneral\nAccording to The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, \"Suggestions have been made that the gifts have significance, as representing the food or sport for each month of the year Importance  [certainly has] long been attached to the Twelve Days, when, for instance, the weather on each day was carefully observed to see what it would be in the corresponding month of the coming year Nevertheless, whatever the ultimate origin of the chant, it seems probable  [that] the lines that survive today both in England and France are merely an irreligious travesty.\" [46]\nIn 1979, a Canadian hymnologist, Hugh D McKellar, published an article, \"How to Decode the Twelve Days of Christmas\", in which he suggested that \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" lyrics were intended as a catechism song to help young English Catholics learn their faith, at a time when practising Catholicism was against the law (from 1558 until 1829) [65] McKellar offered no evidence for his claim Three years later, in 1982, Fr Hal Stockert wrote an article (subsequently posted online in 1995) in which he suggested a similar possible use of the twelve gifts as part of a catechism The possibility that the twelve gifts were used as a catechism during the period of Catholic repression was also hypothesised in this same time period (1987 and 1992) by Fr James Gilhooley, chaplain of Mount Saint Mary College of Newburgh, New York [66] [67] Snopes.com, a website reviewing urban legends, Internet rumours, e-mail forwards, and other stories of unknown or questionable origin, concludes that the hypothesis of the twelve gifts of Christmas being a surreptitious Catholic catechism is incorrect None of the enumerated items would distinguish Catholics from Protestants, and so would hardly need to be secretly encoded [52]\n\n\nMusic\nThe now-standard melody for the carol was popularised by the English baritone and composer Frederic Austin  The singer, having arranged the music for solo voice with piano accompaniment, included it in his concert repertoire from 1905 onwards [68]  A Times review from 1906 praised the \"quaint folk-song\", while noting that \"the words .. are better known than the excellent if intricate tune\" [69]\n\n\nStandard melody\nThe now-standard

melodies\nThe earliest known sources for the text, such as Mirth Without Mischief, do not include music.\n\n\nParodies and other versions\nSince 1984, the cumulative costs of the items mentioned in the Frederic Austin version have been used as a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator Assuming the gifts are repeated in full in each round of the song, then a total of 364 items are delivered by the twelfth day [119] [120] This custom began with and is maintained by PNC Bank [121] [122] Two pricing charts are created, referred to as the Christmas Price Index and The True Cost of Christmas The former is an index of the current costs of one set of each of the gifts given by the True Love to the singer of the song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" The latter is the cumulative cost of all the gifts with the repetitions listed in the song The people mentioned in the song are hired, not purchased The total costs of all goods and services for the 2023 Christmas Price Index is US$46,729.86, [123] or US$201,972.18 for all 364 items [124] [125] The original 1984 cost was $12,623.10 The index has been humorously criticised for not accurately reflecting the true cost of the gifts featured in the Christmas carol [126]\n\n\nChristmas Price Index\nSince 1984, the cumulative costs of the items mentioned in the Frederic Austin version have been used as a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator

The Complexity of Songs, Donald Knuth computes the space complexity of the song as function of the number of days, observing that a hypothetical \"The \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n Days of Christmas\" requires a memory space of \n\n\n\nO\n\n(\n\n\nn\n\n/\n\nlog\n⁡\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O\\left({\\sqrt {n/\\log n}}\\right)}\n\n as \n\n\n\nm\n→\n∞\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m\\to

Christmas carol that has been a popular holiday song for centuries. The song is a cumulative song, meaning that each verse is built on top of the previous verses, with a new gift being given by \"my true love\" on each of the twelve days of Christmas.\n\nLyrics\nThe lyrics of the song are well-known and have been passed down through generations. There are many variations in the lyrics, but the version that has become most popular was established by Frederic Austin in 1909. The first three verses of the song run as follows:\n\nA partridge in a pear tree,\nTwo turtle doves,\nThree French hens,\nFour calling birds,\nFive gold rings,\nSix geese a-laying,\nSeven swans a-swimming,\nEight maids a-milking,\nNine ladies dancing,\nTen lords a-leaping,\nEleven pipers piping,\nTwelve drummers drumming.\n\nVariations of the lyrics\nThe earliest known publications of the words to \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" were an illustrated children's book, Mirth Without Mischief, published in London in 1780, and a broadsheet by Angus, of Newcastle, dated to the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries.\n\nScotland\nA similar cumulative verse from Scotland, \"The Yule Days\", has been likened to \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" in the scholarly literature. It has thirteen days rather than twelve, and the number of gifts does not increase in the manner of \"The Twelve Days\".\n\nFaroe Islands\nIn the Faroe Islands, there is a comparable counting Christmas song. The gifts include: one feather, two geese, three sides of meat, four sheep, five cows, six oxen, seven dishes, eight ponies, nine banners, ten barrels, eleven goats, twelve men, thirteen hides, fourteen rounds of cheese and fifteen deer.\n\nSweden\nIn Blekinge and Småland, southern Sweden, a similar song was also sung. It featured one hen, two barley seeds, three grey geese, four pounds of pork, six flayed sheep, a sow with six pigs, seven åtting grain, eight grey foals with golden saddles, nine newly born cows, ten pairs of oxen, eleven clocks, and finally twelve churches, each with twelve altars, each with twelve priests, each with twelve capes, each with twelve coin-purses, each with twelve daler inside.\n\nFrance\n\"Les Douze Mois\" (\"The Twelve Months\") (also known as \"La Perdriole\"—\"The Partridge\") is another similar cumulative verse from France that has been likened to The Twelve Days of Christmas. Its final verse runs as follows:\n\nTwelve bishops, each with twelve deacons, each with twelve priests, each with twelve altar boys, each with twelve candlesticks, each with twelve candles, each with twelve wicks, each with twelve threads, each with twelve needles, each with twelve threads of gold.\n\nHistory and meaning\nThe exact origins and the meaning of the song are unknown, but it is highly probable that it originated from a children's memory and forfeit game. The song was likely sung by children who would take turns adding a new verse to the song, with each verse building on the previous one.\n\nManner of performance\nMany early sources suggest that The Twelve Days of Christmas was a \"memory-and-forfeits\" game, in which participants were required to repeat a verse of poetry recited by the leader. Players who made an error were required to pay a penalty, in the form of offering a kiss or confection.\n\nMeanings of the gifts\nAn anonymous \"antiquarian\", writing in 1867, speculated that \"pear-tree\" is a corruption of French perdrix ( [pɛʁ.dʁi], \"partridge\"). This was also suggested by Anne Gilchrist, who observed in 1916 that \"from the constancy in English, French, and Languedoc versions of the 'merry little partridge,' I suspect that 'pear-tree' is really perdrix (Old French pertriz) carried into England\".\n\nPartridge in a pear tree\nThe partridge in a pear tree is a symbol of the bird that is said to have been given to the singer of the song by their true love. The pear tree is a symbol of fertility and abundance.\n\nFrench hens\nThe French hens are a symbol of the wealth and prosperity of the singer's true love.\n\nColly birds\nThe colly birds are a symbol of the darkness and cold of winter.\n\nGold rings\nThe gold rings are a symbol of the wealth and opulence of the singer's true love.\n\nGeneral\nAccording to The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, \"Suggestions have been made that the gifts have significance, as representing the food or sport for each month of the year\". However, whatever the ultimate origin of the chant, it seems probable that the lines that survive today both in England and France are merely an irreligious travesty.\n\nIn 1979, a Canadian hymnologist, Hugh D McKellar, published an article, \"How to Decode the Twelve Days of Christmas\", in which he suggested that \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" lyrics were intended as a catechism song to help young English Catholics learn their faith, at a time when practising Catholicism was against the law (from 1558 until 1829).\n\nMusic\nThe now-standard melody for the carol was popularised by the English baritone and composer Frederic Austin. The singer, having arranged the music for solo voice with piano accompaniment, included it in his concert repertoire from 1905 onwards. A Times review from 1906 praised the \"quaint folk-song\", while noting that \"the words .. are better known than the excellent if intricate tune\".\n\nStandard melody\nThe now-standard melody for the carol was popularised by the English baritone and composer Frederic Austin. The singer, having arranged the music for solo voice with piano accompaniment, included it in his concert repertoire from 1905 onwards.\n\nEarlier melodies\nThe earliest known sources for the text, such as Mirth Without Mischief, do not include music.\n\nParodies and other versions\nSince 1984, the cumulative costs of the items mentioned in the Frederic Austin version have been used as a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator. Assuming the gifts are repeated in full in each round of the song, then a total of 364 items are delivered by the twelfth day. Two pricing charts are created, referred to as the Christmas Price Index and The True Cost of Christmas. The former is an index of the current costs of one set of each of the gifts given by the True Love to the singer of the song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". The latter is the cumulative cost of all the gifts with the repetitions listed in the song.\n\nChristmas Price Index\nSince 1984, the cumulative costs of the items mentioned in the Frederic Austin version have been used as a tongue-in-cheek economic indicator. Assuming the gifts are repeated in full in each round of the song, then a total of 364 items are delivered by the twelfth day.\n\nComputational complexity\nIn the famous article The Complexity of Songs, Donald Knuth computes the space complexity of the song as function of the number of days, observing that a hypothetical \"The m Days of Christmas\" requires a memory space of O(√n/log n) as m → ∞, where n is the length of the song, showing that songs with complexity lower than O(√n) indeed exist. Incidentally, it is also observed that the total number of gifts after m days equals m^3/6 + m^2/2 + m/3.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

\"partridge\") [18]  This was also suggested by Anne Gilchrist, who observed in 1916 that \"from the constancy in English, French, and Languedoc versions of the 'merry little partridge,' I suspect that 'pear-tree' is really perdrix (Old French pertriz) carried into England\" [55]  The variant text \"part of a juniper tree\", found as early as c 1840, is likely not original, since \"partridge\" is found in the French versions [11] [48] It is probably a corruption of \"partridge in a pear tree\", though Gilchrist suggests \"juniper tree\" could have been joli perdrix,  [pretty partridge] [56] [55]\n\n\nPartridge in a pear tree\nAn anonymous \"antiquarian\", writing in 1867, speculated that \"pear-tree\" is a corruption of French perdrix ( [pɛʁ.dʁi], \"partridge\") [18]  This was also

hens\nGilchrist suggests that the adjective \"French\" may mean \"foreign\" [55]  Sharp reports that one singer sings \"Britten chains\", which he interprets as a corruption of \"Breton hens\" [58]  William and Ceil Baring-Gould also suggest that the birds are Breton hens, which they see as another indication that the carol is of French origin [59]\n\n\nColly birds\nThe word \"colly\", found in the earliest publications, was the source of considerable confusion [60]  Multiple sources confirm that it is a dialectal word, found in Somerset and elsewhere, meaning \"black\", [61] so \"colly birds\" are blackbirds [14] [55]  Despite this, other theories about the word's origin are also found in the literature, such as that the word is a corruption of French collet (\"ruff\"), or of \"coloured\" [18] [47]\n\n\nGold rings\nShahn suggests that \"the five golden rings refer to the ringed pheasant\" [62] William and Ceil Baring-Gould reiterate this idea, which implies that the gifts for first seven days are all birds [59] Others suggest the gold rings refer to \"five goldspinks\"—a goldspink being an old name for a goldfinch; [63] or even canaries [a] However, the 1780 publication includes an illustration that clearly depicts the \"five gold rings\" as being jewellery [4]\n\n\nGeneral\nAccording to The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, \"Suggestions have been made that the gifts have significance, as representing the food or sport for each month of the year Importance  [certainly has] long been attached to the Twelve Days, when, for instance, the weather on each day was carefully observed to see what it would be in the corresponding month of the coming year Nevertheless, whatever the ultimate origin of the chant, it seems probable  [that] the lines that survive today both in England and France are merely an irreligious travesty.\" [46]\nIn 1979, a Canadian hymnologist, Hugh D McKellar, published an article, \"How to Decode the Twelve Days of Christmas\", in which he suggested that \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" lyrics were intended as a catechism song to help young English Catholics learn their faith, at a time when practising Catholicism was against the law (from 1558 until 1829) [65] McKellar offered no evidence for his claim Three years later, in 1982, Fr Hal Stockert wrote an article (subsequently posted online in 1995) in which he suggested a similar possible use of the twelve gifts as part of a catechism The possibility that the twelve gifts were used as a catechism during the period of Catholic repression was also hypothesised in this same time period (1987 and 1992) by Fr James Gilhooley, chaplain of Mount Saint Mary College of Newburgh, New York [66] [67] Snopes.com, a website reviewing urban legends, Internet rumours, e-mail forwards, and other stories of unknown or questionable origin, concludes that the hypothesis of the twelve gifts of Christmas being a surreptitious Catholic catechism is incorrect None of the enumerated items would distinguish Catholics from Protestants, and so would hardly need to be secretly encoded [52]\n\n\nMusic\nThe now-standard melody for the carol was

Born on June 29, 1930, in New York City, Evans was the son of Florence (née Krasne) and Archie Shapera, a dentist in Harlem. His parents were both second-generation Jews, and Evans grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan during the 1930s.\n\n## Early Life and Acting Career\n\nEvans's early life was marked by privilege and comfort, despite the economic struggles of the Great Depression. His family's wealth and social status allowed him to enjoy a relatively easy childhood, and he was encouraged to pursue his interests in the arts. Evans began his career in the entertainment industry as a teenager, working on radio shows and performing in voiceover roles. By his own estimation, he appeared in over 300 radio shows before he turned 18.\n\nOne of Evans's early successes was his role as a voice actor on the popular radio situation comedy \"The Aldrich Family.\" This experience helped him develop his skills as a performer and introduced him to the world of show business. However, Evans soon became disillusioned with his own acting talent and decided to pursue a career in film production.\n\n## Career as Producer\n\nEvans's transition to film production was marked by a series of key events and relationships. In the 1960s, he became involved with Paramount Pictures, where he worked as a production executive and developed his skills as a producer. During this time, he purchased the rights to the novel \"The Detective\" and produced a film adaptation starring Frank Sinatra, Lee Remick, and Jack Klugman.\n\nEvans's aggressive production style and attention to detail quickly made him a respected figure in the industry. He was known for his ability to identify and develop talent, and his films often featured a mix of established stars and newcomers. Evans's production company, which he established with Charles Bluhdorn, produced a number of successful films, including \"The Detective\" and \"The Cotton Club.\"\n\n## Cotton Club Murder\n\nIn the early 1980s, Evans became involved in a high-profile controversy surrounding the production of \"The Cotton Club.\" The film, which was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, was based on the true story of the legendary New York nightclub and its owner, Owney Madden. However, the production was plagued by delays and financial problems, and Evans became embroiled in a bitter dispute with the film's director and other stakeholders.\n\nThe dispute eventually led to the murder of Roy Radin, a producer and friend of Evans who had become involved in the production. Radin was killed in 1983, and Evans was accused of being involved in his murder. However, Evans denied any involvement and was never charged with a crime.\n\n## Cocaine Trafficking\n\nIn the 1980s, Evans became embroiled in a series of scandals surrounding his personal life and business dealings. He was accused of using cocaine and other illicit substances, and he became involved in a number of shady business ventures. Evans's personal life was also marked by a series of high-profile marriages and relationships, including his marriage to actress Ali MacGraw.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nEvans was married seven times during his lifetime, and his personal life was marked by a series of high-profile relationships and scandals. He married his first wife, Sharon Hugueny, in 1961, and they divorced in 1962. Subsequently, he married Camilla Sparv, Ali MacGraw, Phyllis George, Catherine Oxenberg, Leslie Ann Woodward, and Victoria White.\n\nEvans's marriage to Oxenberg was particularly notable, as it was annulled after just nine days. Evans's marriage to White was also short-lived, and the two divorced in 2006. Throughout his life, Evans was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to attract high-profile partners.\n\n## Health and Death\n\nIn 1998, Evans suffered a series of three strokes that left him paralyzed on his right side and unable to speak. He was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was encouraged to work on his speech and recovery by his friend and media mogul, Sumner Redstone.\n\nTragically, Evans's health struggles were compounded by the loss of his friend and fellow producer, Frank Sinatra, who died of a heart attack in one of the adjoining rooms at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

He was known for his ability to manipulate the stock market and gain large profits, but his methods were also criticized for being unethical and illegal.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHarshad Shantilal Mehta was born on 29 July 1954, in Paneli Moti, Rajkot district, in a Gujarati Jain family. His early childhood was spent in Borivali, where his father was a small-time textile businessman. Mehta's early life was marked by a strong interest in sports, particularly cricket, and he was an enthusiastic player throughout his school days.\n\n**Education**\n\nMehta did his early studies in Janta Public School, Camp 2 Bhilai. He was not an outstanding student and did not show any special promise in school. After completing his schooling, Mehta moved to Mumbai to find work and pursue his studies. He completed his B.Com in 1976 from Lala Lajpatrai College, Bombay. During his time in college, Mehta worked a number of odd jobs, including sales positions in various companies.\n\n**Work and Life**\n\nMehta started his career as a salesperson in the Mumbai office of New India Assurance Company Limited (NIACL). He worked in this position for a short period before resigning and joining a brokerage firm. Mehta's experience in the brokerage firm sparked his interest in the stock market, and he began to study it intensively. He soon moved to a lower-level clerical job at the brokerage firm Harjivandas Nemidas Securities, where he worked as a jobber for the broker Prasann Pranjivandas Broker, who he considered his \"Guru\".\n\n**Background of the 1992 Security Fraud**\n\nIn the early 1990s, banks in India were not allowed to invest in the equity markets. However, they were expected to post profits and retain a certain ratio (threshold) of their assets in government fixed-interest bonds. Mehta cleverly squeezed capital out of the banking system to address this requirement of banks and pumped this money into the share market. He promised the banks higher rates of interest while asking them to transfer the money into his personal account, under the guise of buying securities for them from other banks. At that time, a bank had to go through a broker to buy securities and forward bonds from other banks. Mehta used this money temporarily in his account to buy shares, thus hiking up demand of certain shares (of good established companies like ACC, Sterlite Industries, and Videocon) dramatically, selling them off, passing on a part of the proceeds to the bank, and keeping the rest for himself. This resulted in stocks like ACC (which was trading in 1991 for ₹200/share) skyrocketing to nearly ₹9,000 in just 3 months.\n\n**Bank Funds Scam**\n\nMehta's methods were not limited to just buying and selling shares. He also used another instrument, known as a bank receipt, to manipulate the market. In a ready forward deal, securities were not moved back and forth in actuality. Instead, the borrower, i.e., the seller of securities, gave the buyer of the securities a bank receipt (BR). The BR serves as a receipt from the selling bank and also promises that the buyer will receive the securities they have paid for at the end of the terms.\n\n**Outbreak of 1992 Securities Fraud**\n\nOn 23 April 1992, journalist Sucheta Dalal exposed Mehta's illegal methods in a column in The Times of India. Mehta was dipping illegally into the banking system to finance his buying. The expose sparked a massive outcry and led to a thorough investigation into Mehta's activities. Mehta was eventually arrested and charged with various offenses related to the scam.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nMehta's life and activities have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows. The most notable of these is the 2020 film \"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story\", which stars Pratik Gandhi as Mehta and tells the story of his rise and fall.\n\n**Books**\n\n1. \"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story\" by Vikram Chandra\n2. \"The Big Bull: The Untold Story of Harshad Mehta\" by Sucheta Dalal\n3. \"Harshad Mehta: The Man Who Crashed the Stock Market\" by Inder Malhotra\n\n**Films and Television**\n\n1. \"Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story\" (2020) -

Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis and Palestinians [citation needed]\n\n\nAncient period\nThe region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization [37] During the Bronze Age, independent Canaanite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Syria Between 1550 and 1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian New Kingdom who held power until the 1178 BCE Battle of Djahy (Canaan) during the wider Bronze Age collapse [38]\n\n\nClassical antiquity\nIn the 330s BCE, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered the region, which changed hands several times during the wars of the Diadochi and later Syrian Wars It ultimately fell to the Seleucid Empire between 219 and 200 BCE During that period, the region became heavily hellenized, building tensions between Greeks and locals \n\n\nEarly Muslim period\nPalestine was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, beginning in 634 CE [67] In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim conquest of the Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as the military district of Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria) [68] In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem [69] The Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture [70]\n\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid period\nThe Fatimids again lost the region to the Crusaders in 1099 The Crusaders set up [82] the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1291) [83] Their control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until their defeat by Saladin's forces in 1187, [84] after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids, [84] except for the years 1229–1244 when Jerusalem and other areas were retaken [85] by the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem, by then ruled from Acre (1191–1291), but, despite seven further crusades, the Franks were no longer a significant power in the region [86] The Fourth Crusade, which did not reach Palestine, led directly to the decline of the Byzantine Empire, dramatically reducing Christian influence throughout the region [87]\n\n\nMamluk period\nThe Mamluk Sultanate was created in Egypt as an indirect result of the Seventh Crusade [88] The Mongol Empire reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the Mongol raids into Palestine under Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and reaching an apex at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut, where they were pushed back by the Mamluks [89]\n\n\nOttoman period\nIn 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516 [90] Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government) [91]\n\n\nBritish Mandate period\nThe British began their Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1915 [105] The war reached southern Palestine in 1917, progressing to Gaza and around Jerusalem by the end of the year [105] The British secured Jerusalem in December 1917 [106] They moved into the Jordan valley in 1918 and a campaign by the Entente into northern Palestine led to victory at Megiddo in September [106]\n\n\nArab–Israeli conflict\nIn the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the Mandate territory, Jordan captured the regions of Judea and Samaria, [111] [xxi] [112] renaming it the \"West Bank\", while the Gaza Strip was captured by Egypt [113] [114] Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, also known as al-Nakba, the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes were not allowed to return following the Lausanne Conference of 1949 [115]\n\n\nBoundaries\nThe boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history [xxv] [xxvi] The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories [131] At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories on both sides of the river formed part of the same administrative unit During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin [132]\n\n\nPre-modern period\nThe boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history [xxv] [xxvi] The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed

northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin [132]\n\n\nModern period\nNineteenth-century sources refer to Palestine as extending from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley [135] Others refer to it as extending from the sea to the desert [135] Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz [136] What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem [32] The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 [137] [138]\n\n\nCurrent usage\nThe region of Palestine is the eponym for the Palestinian people and the culture of Palestine, both of which are defined as relating to the whole historical region, usually defined as the localities within the border of Mandatory Palestine The 1968 Palestinian National Covenant described Palestine as the \"homeland of the Arab Palestinian people\", with \"the boundaries it had during the British Mandate\" [141]\n\n\nAdministration\n\n\n\nDemographics\nEstimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.\n\n\nEarly demographics\nEstimating the

The last known mention is 300 years later on Padiiset's Statue. Seven known Assyrian inscriptions refer to the region of \"Palashtu\" or \"Pilistu\", beginning with Adad-nirari III in the Nimrud Slab in c. 800 BCE through to a treaty made by Esarhaddon more than a century later. Neither the Egyptian nor the Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.\n\n## History\n\nSituated at a strategic location between Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Achaemenids, ancient Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Sasanians, Byzantines, the Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n## Overview\n\nSituated at a strategic location between Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Achaemenids, ancient Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Sasanians, Byzantines, the Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis and Palestinians.\n\n## Ancient Period\n\nThe region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities, and civilization. During the Bronze Age, independent Canaanite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Syria. Between 1550 and 1400 BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian New Kingdom, who held power until the 1178 BCE Battle of Djahy (Canaan) during the wider Bronze Age collapse.\n\n## Classical Antiquity\n\nIn the 330s BCE, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered the region, which changed hands several times during the wars of the Diadochi and later Syrian Wars. It ultimately fell to the Seleucid Empire between 219 and 200 BCE. During that period, the region became heavily hellenized, building tensions between Greeks and locals.\n\n## Early Muslim Period\n\nPalestine was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, beginning in 634 CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim conquest of the Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as the military district of Jund Filastin within the province of Bilad al-Sham (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.\n\n## Crusader/Ayyubid Period\n\nThe Fatimids again lost the region to the Crusaders in 1099. The Crusaders set up the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1291). Their control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until their defeat by Saladin's forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids, except for the years 1229-1244 when Jerusalem and other areas were retaken by the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem, by then ruled from Acre (1191-1291). Despite seven further crusades, the Franks were no longer a significant power in the region. The Fourth Crusade, which did not reach Palestine, led directly to the decline of the Byzantine Empire, dramatically reducing Christian influence throughout the region.\n\n## Mamluk Period\n\nThe Mamluk Sultanate was created in Egypt as an indirect result of the Seventh Crusade. The Mongol Empire reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the Mongol raids into Palestine under Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and reaching an apex at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut, where they were pushed back by the Mamluks.\n\n## Ottoman Period\n\nIn 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516. Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun, and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government).\n\n## British Mandate Period\n\nThe British began their Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1915. The war reached southern Palestine in 1917, progressing to Gaza and around Jerusalem by the end of the year. The British secured Jerusalem in December 1917. They moved into the Jordan valley in 1918 and a campaign by the Entente into northern Palestine led to victory at Megiddo in September.\n\n## Arab-Israeli Conflict\n\nIn the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the Mandate territory, Jordan captured the regions of Judea and Samaria, renaming it the \"West Bank\", while the Gaza Strip was captured by Egypt. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, also known as al-Nakba, the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes were not allowed to return following the Lausanne Conference of 1949.\n\n## Boundaries\n\nThe boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea, and River Jordan) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states, for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories on both sides of the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin.\n\n## Modern Period\n\nNineteenth-century sources refer to Palestine as extending from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others refer to it as extending from the sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.\n\n## Current Usage\n\nThe region of Palestine is the eponym for the Palestinian people and the culture of Palestine, both of which are defined as relating to the whole historical region, usually defined as the localities within the border of Mandatory Palestine. The 1968 Palestinian National Covenant described Palestine as the \"homeland of the Arab Palestinian people\", with \"the boundaries it had during the British Mandate\".\n\n## Administration\n\nThe Palestine Authority, also known as the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), was established in 1993 as an interim self-government body for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with its capital in Ramallah. The PNA's main objectives are to provide services, maintain security, and negotiate with Israel and other countries on behalf of the Palestinian people.\n\n## Demographics\n\nEstimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.\n\n## Early Demographics\n\nEstimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.\n\n## Late Ottoman and British Mandate Periods\n\nIn a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman rule of Palestine, Bernard Lewis reports: The population of Palestine was approximately 600,000 people in 1517, when the Ottoman Empire conquered the region. By the mid-19th century, the population had grown to around 1.2 million people.\n\n## Current Demographics\n\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2015, the total population of Israel was 8.5 million people, of which 75% were Jews, 21% Arabs, and 4% \"others\". Of the Jewish group, 76% were Sabras (born in Israel); the rest were olim (immigrants)—16% from Europe, the former Soviet republics, and the Americas, and 8% from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries.\n\n## Flora and Fauna\n\nThe World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions is widely used in recording the distribution of plants. The scheme uses the code \"PAL\" to refer to the region of Palestine – a Level 3 area. The WGSRPD's Palestine is further divided into Israel (PAL-IS), including the Palestinian territories, and Jordan (PAL-JO), so is larger than some other definitions of \"Palestine\".\n\n## Flora Distribution\n\nThe World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions is widely used in recording the distribution of plants.

(inspired from a poem written by Subramania Bharati) by screenwriter B Jeyamohan, [21] instead of a fresh script he planned [22] On 6 August 2021, Menon announced the film's new title Vendhu

production of the film, several producers had filed a complaint against Silambarasan at the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) for not working on the projects he had advanced before the shoot [79] Global Infotainment's Michael Rayappan too criticised Silambarasan, after failing to compensate the losses incurred during the production of Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan (2017) [79] As a result, the Tamil Film Producers Council issued a red card against Silambarasan following the complaints and also insisted the Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI) to stop the production works on the film However, FEFSI had supported the film because Ishari K Ganesh had helped the association in several ways during the COVID-19 lockdown [80] It eventually resulted in the split between TFPC and FEFSI, and the shooting was disrupted following this incident [79] [81] Fans of Silambarasan eventually supported the actor and condemned TFPC's actions; [82] they started using the hashtag \"#SaveTamilCinemafromTFPC\" eventually being trending for two days on Twitter [82] Later, on 26 August 2021, Ganesh admitted to pay the requested amount on behalf of the actor in order to resume

Her research on the nutritional value of green tea led to a major breakthrough in the discovery of vitamin C, and her work had a lasting impact on the agricultural industry in Japan.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMichiyo Tsujimura was born in 1888 in what is now Okegawa in Saitama Prefecture. She came from a family of modest means and was the eldest of six children. Tsujimura's early life was marked by a strong interest in education and a desire to pursue a career in science.\n\nTsujimura attended Tokyo Prefecture Women's Normal School, where she was inspired by the biologist Kono Yasui to pursue a career in scientific research. She graduated in 1909 and went on to attend the Division of Biochemical Science at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School. There, she continued to be mentored by Yasui and developed a deep understanding of the principles of biochemistry.\n\nAfter graduating in 1913, Tsujimura became a teacher at Yokohama High School for Women in Kanagawa Prefecture. She remained in this position until 1917, when she returned to Saitama Prefecture to take up a teaching position at Saitama Women's Normal School.\n\n**Career and Research**\n\nTsujimura's research career began in 1920 when she joined Hokkaido Imperial University as a laboratory assistant. At the time, the university did not accept female students, so Tsujimura worked in an unpaid position at the Food Nutritional Laboratory of the university's Agricultural Chemistry Department. There, she conducted research on the nutrition of silkworms and developed a deep understanding of the importance of nutrition in animal health.\n\nIn 1922, Tsujimura transferred to the Medical Chemical Laboratory at the Medical College of Tokyo Imperial University. However, her time at this laboratory was cut short when the laboratory was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake in September. Undeterred, Tsujimura transferred to RIKEN as a research student in October 1923.\n\nAt RIKEN, Tsujimura worked in the laboratory of Umetaro Suzuki, a doctor of agriculture. She conducted research on nutritional chemistry and made significant contributions to the field of biochemistry. In 1924, Tsujimura and her colleague Seitaro Miura discovered vitamin C in green tea. This finding was a major breakthrough in the field of nutritional chemistry and had a lasting impact on the agricultural industry in Japan.\n\nTsujimura and Miura published their findings in the journal Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry in 1924. The article, titled \"On Vitamin C in Green Tea,\" was a major contribution to the field of biochemistry and marked a significant milestone in Tsujimura's research career.\n\n**Retirement, Death, and Legacy**\n\nTsujimura retired from Ochanomizu University as a professor in 1956, but continued lecturing part-time until 1961. During this time, she was a professor at Jissen Women's University in Tokyo from 1955 to 1963, when she became a professor emeritus.\n\nTsujimura was awarded the Japan Prize of Agricultural Science in 1956 for her research on green tea. She was also conferred the Order of the Precious Crown of the Fourth Class in 1968 for her contributions to the field of biochemistry.\n\nTsujimura died in Toyohashi on 1 June 1969 at the age of 80. Her legacy as a pioneering female biochemist and educator continues to be celebrated in Japan and around the world.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* History of Biochemistry in Japan\n* Japanese Women in Science\n* Nutrition and Biochemistry\n* Green Tea and Health", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michiyo_Tsujimura\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nTsujimura was born in 1888 in what is now Okegawa in Saitama Prefecture [1] She attended Tokyo Prefecture Women's Normal School, graduating in 1909, and the Division of Biochemical Science at Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School There, she was taught by the biologist Kono Yasui, who inspired in Tsujimura an interest in scientific research She graduated in 1913 and became a teacher at Yokohama High School for Women in Kanagawa Prefecture In 1917, she returned to Saitama Prefecture to teach at Saitama Women's Normal School [2]\n\n\nCareer and research\nTsujimura's research career began in 1920 when she joined Hokkaido Imperial University as a laboratory assistant At the time, the university did not accept female students, so Tsujimura worked in an unpaid position at the Food Nutritional Laboratory of the university's Agricultural Chemistry Department There, she researched the nutrition of silkworms before transferring to the Medical Chemical Laboratory at the Medical College of Tokyo Imperial University in 1922 The laboratory was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake in September, so she transferred to RIKEN as a research student in October 1923 She worked in the laboratory of Umetaro Suzuki, a doctor of agriculture, and researched nutritional chemistry Tsujimura and her colleague Seitaro Miura discovered vitamin C in green tea in 1924, and published an article titled \"On Vitamin C in Green Tea\" in the journal Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry [2] This finding contributed to an increase in green tea exports to North America [2]\n\n\nRetirement, death, and legacy\nTsujimura retired from Ochanomizu University as a professor in 1956, but continued lecturing part-time until 1961 She was a professor at Jissen Women's University in Tokyo [5] from 1955 to 1963, when she became a professor emeritus She was awarded the Japan Prize of Agricultural Science in 1956 for her research on green tea and was conferred the Order of the Precious Crown of the Fourth Class in 1968 She died in Toyohashi on 1 June 1969 at the age of 80 [2]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

various ways to derive and understand this result were given in the previous subsections.\n\n\nSolutions using conditional probability and other solutions\nThe simple solutions above show that a player with a strategy of switching wins the car with overall probability ⁠2/3⁠, i.e., without taking account of which door was opened by the host [49] [13] In accordance with this, most sources for the topic of probability calculate the conditional probabilities that the car is behind door 1 and door 2 to be ⁠1/3⁠ and ⁠2/3⁠ respectively given the contestant initially picks door 1 and the host opens door 3 [2] [38] [50] [35] [13] [49] [36] The solutions in this section consider just those cases in which the player picked door 1 and the host opened door 3.\n\n\nRefining the simple solution\nIf we assume that the host opens a door at random, when given a choice, then which door the host opens gives us no information at all as to whether or not the car is behind door 1 In the simple solutions, we have already observed that the probability that the car is behind door 1, the door initially chosen by the player, is initially ⁠1/3⁠ Moreover, the host is certainly going to open a (different) door, so opening a door (which door is unspecified) does not change this ⁠1/3⁠ must be the average of: the probability that the car is behind door 1, given that the host picked door 2, and the probability of car behind door 1, given the host picked door 3: this is because these are the only two possibilities But, these two probabilities are the same Therefore, they are both equal to ⁠1/3⁠ [38] This shows that the chance that the car is behind door 1, given that the player initially chose this door and given that the host opened door 3, is ⁠1/3⁠, and it follows that the chance that the car is behind door 2, given that the player initially chose door 1 and the host opened door 3, is ⁠2/3⁠ The analysis also shows that the overall success rate of ⁠2/3⁠, achieved by always switching, cannot be improved, and underlines what already may well have been intuitively obvious: the choice facing the player is that between the door initially chosen, and the other door left closed by the host, the specific numbers on these doors are irrelevant.\n\n\nConditional probability by direct calculation\nBy definition, the conditional probability of winning by switching given the contestant initially picks door 1 and the host opens door 3 is the probability for the event \"car is behind door 2 and host opens door 3\" divided by the probability for \"host opens door 3\" These probabilities can be determined referring to the conditional probability table below, or to an equivalent decision tree [50] [13] [49] The conditional probability of winning by switching is ⁠1/3/1/3 + 1/6⁠, which is ⁠2/3⁠ [2]\n\n\nBayes' theorem\nMany probability text books and articles in the field of probability theory derive the conditional probability solution through a formal application of Bayes' theorem; among them books by Gill [51] and Henze [52] Use of the odds form of Bayes' theorem, often called Bayes' rule, makes such a derivation more transparent [34] [53]\n\n\nStrategic dominance solution\nGoing back to Nalebuff, [55] the Monty Hall problem is also much studied in the literature on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions correspond to this point of view Savant asks for a decision, not a chance And the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown From this point of view, one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.\n\n\nSolutions by simulation\nA simple way to demonstrate that a switching strategy really does win two out of three times with the standard assumptions is to simulate the game with playing cards [58] [59] Three cards from an ordinary deck are used to represent the three doors; one 'special' card represents the door with the car and two other cards represent the goat doors.\n\n\nVariants\nA common variant of the problem, assumed by several academic authors as the canonical problem, does not make the simplifying assumption that the host must uniformly choose the door to open, but instead that he uses some other strategy The confusion as to which formalization is authoritative has led to considerable acrimony, particularly because this variant makes proofs more involved without altering the optimality of the always-switch strategy for the player In this variant, the player can have different probabilities of winning depending on the observed choice of the host, but in any case the probability of winning by switching is at least ⁠1/2⁠ (and can be as high as 1), while the overall probability of winning by switching is still exactly ⁠2/3⁠ The variants are sometimes presented in succession in textbooks and articles intended to teach the basics of probability theory and game theory A considerable number of other generalizations have also been studied.\n\n\nOther host behaviors\nThe version of the Monty Hall problem published in Parade in 1990 did not specifically state that the host would always open another door, or always offer a choice to switch, or even never open the door revealing the car However, Savant made it clear in her second follow-up column that the intended host's behavior could only be what led to the ⁠2/3⁠ probability she gave as her original answer \"Anything else is a different question.\" [5] \"Virtually all of my critics understood the intended scenario I personally read nearly three thousand letters (out of the many additional thousands that arrived) and found nearly every one insisting simply that because two options remained (or an equivalent error), the chances were even Very few raised questions about ambiguity, and the letters actually published in the column were not among those few.\" [60] The answer follows if the car is placed randomly behind any door, the host must open a door revealing a goat regardless of the player's initial choice and, if two doors are available, chooses which one to open randomly [9] The table below shows a variety of other possible host behaviors and the impact on the success of switching.\n\n\nN doors\nD L Ferguson (1975 in a letter to Selvin [2]) suggests an N-door generalization of the original problem in which the host opens p losing doors and then offers the player the opportunity to switch; in this variant switching wins with probability \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n⋅\n\n\n\nN\n−\n1\n\n\nN\n−\np\n−\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{N}}\\cdot {\\frac {N-1}{N-p-1}}}\n\n This probability is always greater than \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{N}}}\n\n, therefore switching always brings an advantage.\n\n\nQuantum version\nA quantum version of the paradox illustrates some points about the relation between classical or non-quantum information and quantum information, as encoded in the states of quantum mechanical systems The formulation is loosely based on quantum game theory The three doors are replaced by a quantum system allowing three alternatives; opening a door and looking behind it is translated as making a particular measurement The rules can be stated in this language, and once again the choice for the player is to stick with the initial choice, or change to another \"orthogonal\" option The latter strategy turns out to double the chances, just as in the classical case However, if the show host has not randomized the position of the prize in a fully quantum mechanical way, the player can do even better, and can sometimes even win the prize with certainty [65] [66]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest of several probability puzzles related to the Monty Hall problem is Bertrand's box paradox, posed by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités [67] In this puzzle, there are three boxes: a box containing two gold coins, a box with two silver coins, and a box with one of each After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random that happens to be a gold coin, the question is what is the probability that the other coin is gold As in the Monty Hall problem, the intuitive answer is ⁠1/2⁠, but the probability is actually ⁠2/3⁠.\n\n\nIn literature\nAndrew Crumey's novel Mr Mee (2000) contains a version of the Monty Hall problem set in the 18th century In Chapter 1 it is presented as a shell game that a prisoner must win in order to save his life In Chapter 8 the philosopher Rosier, his student Tissot and Tissot's wife test the probabilities by simulation and verify the counter-intuitive result They then perform an experiment involving black and white beads resembling the boy or girl paradox, and in a humorous allusion to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, Rosier erroneously concludes that \"as soon as I saw my own bead, a wave of pure probability flew, instantaneously, from one end of the room to the other This accounted for the sudden change from two thirds to a half, as a finite quantum of probability (of weight one sixth) passed miraculously between the beads, launched by my own act of observation.\" [71] Rosier explains his theory to Tissot, but \"His poor grasp of my theories emerged some days later when, his sister being about to give birth, Tissot paid for a baby girl to be sent into the room, believing it would make the new child twice as likely to be born male My pupil however gained a niece; and I found no difficulty in explaining the fallacy of his reasoning Tissot had merely misunderstood my remarkable Paradox of the Twins, which states that if a boy tells you he has a sibling, then the probability of it being a sister is not a half, but two thirds.\" [72] This is followed by a version of the unexpected hanging paradox.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSimilar puzzles in probability and decision theory\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Monty Hall Problem\n=====================\n\nThe Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle named after the host of the game show Let's Make a Deal. It was first described by Steve Selvin in 1975 and has since become a classic example of a probability paradox.\n\nParadox\n--------\n\nThe Monty Hall problem is a simple game where a contestant chooses one of three doors, behind which is a car or a goat. The host knows what is behind each door and will always reveal a goat if the contestant chooses the car. The contestant is then given the option to switch to the other unopened door. The paradox arises when people intuitively think that the probability of winning the car is 50%, but the correct answer is 2/3.\n\nStandard assumptions\n-------------------\n\nBy the standard assumptions, the probability of winning the car after switching is 2/3. This solution is due to the behavior of the host, who is assumed to always reveal a goat. If the contestant initially chooses a door with the car, the host will open the other door with a goat, leaving the contestant with a 1/3 chance of choosing the car. If the contestant initially chooses a door with a goat, the host will open a different door with a goat, giving the contestant a 2/3 chance of switching to the door with the car.\n\nSimple solutions\n----------------\n\nThe solution presented by Marilyn vos Savant in Parade shows the three possible arrangements of one car and two goats behind three doors and the result of staying or switching after initially picking door 1 in each case:\n\n*   If the contestant initially chooses door 1, there is a 1/3 chance of the car being behind door 1 and a 2/3 chance of the car being behind one of the other two doors.\n*   If the contestant switches after initially choosing door 1, there is a 2/3 chance of the car being behind the chosen door.\n*   If the contestant initially chooses door 2, there is a 1/3 chance of the car being behind door 2 and a 2/3 chance of the car being behind one of the other two doors.\n*   If the contestant switches after initially choosing door 2, there is a 2/3 chance of the car being behind the chosen door.\n*   If the contestant initially chooses door 3, there is a 1/3 chance of the car being behind door 3 and a 2/3 chance of the car being behind one of the other two doors.\n*   If the contestant switches after initially choosing door 3, there is a 2/3 chance of the car being behind the chosen door.\n\nSavant and the media furor\n-------------------------\n\nThe Monty Hall problem was first presented by Steve Selvin in 1975 and has since become a classic example of a probability paradox. When Marilyn vos Savant presented the solution in Parade, she was met with a massive amount of criticism, including a letter from a professor who claimed that she was wrong and that the probability of winning the car was 50%. However, Savant's solution has been widely accepted and is now considered a classic example of a probability paradox.\n\nConfusion and criticism\n----------------------\n\nWhen first presented with the Monty Hall problem, an overwhelming majority of people assume that each door has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter. Out of 228 subjects in one study, only 13% chose to switch. In his book The Power of Logical Thinking, cognitive psychologist Massimo Piattelli Palmarini writes: \"No other statistical puzzle comes so close to fooling all the people all the time, and even Nobel physicists systematically give the wrong answer, and that they insist on it, and they are ready to berate in print those who propose the right answer.\" Pigeons repeatedly exposed to the problem show that they rapidly learn to always switch, unlike humans.\n\nSources of confusion\n--------------------\n\nWhen first presented with the Monty Hall problem, an overwhelming majority of people assume that each door has an equal probability and conclude that switching does not matter. However, the key to understanding the Monty Hall problem is to recognize that the host's behavior is not random and that the contestant can use this information to make an informed decision.\n\nCriticism of the simple solutions\n--------------------------------\n\nAs already remarked, most sources in the topic of probability, including many introductory probability textbooks, solve the problem by showing the conditional probabilities that the car is behind door 1 and door 2 are 1/3 and 2/3 (not 1/2 and 1/2) given that the contestant initially picks door 1 and the host opens door 3. Various ways to derive and understand this result were given in the previous subsections.\n\nSolutions using conditional probability and other solutions\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe simple solutions above show that a player with a strategy of switching wins the car with overall probability 2/3, i.e., without taking account of which door was opened by the host. In accordance with this, most sources for the topic of probability calculate the conditional probabilities that the car is behind door 1 and door 2 to be 1/3 and 2/3 respectively given the contestant initially picks door 1 and the host opens door 3. The solutions in this section consider just those cases in which the player picked door 1 and the host opened door 3.\n\nRefining the simple solution\n---------------------------\n\nIf we assume that the host opens a door at random, when given a choice, then which door the host opens gives us no information at all as to whether or not the car is behind door 1. The probability that the car is behind door 1, the door initially chosen by the player, is initially 1/3. The host is certainly going to open a (different) door, so opening a door (which door is unspecified) does not change this 1/3 must be the average of the probability that the car is behind door 1, given that the host picked door 2, and the probability of car behind door 1, given the host picked door 3: this is because these are the only two possibilities. But, these two probabilities are the same. Therefore, they are both equal to 1/3. This shows that the chance that the car is behind door 1, given that the player initially chose this door and given that the host opened door 3, is 1/3, and it follows that the chance that the car is behind door 2, given that the player initially chose door 1 and the host opened door 3, is 2/3. The analysis also shows that the overall success rate of 2/3, achieved by always switching, cannot be improved, and underlines what already may well have been intuitively obvious: the choice facing the player is that between the door initially chosen, and the other door left closed by the host, the specific numbers on these doors are irrelevant.\n\nConditional probability by direct calculation\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBy definition, the conditional probability of winning by switching given the contestant initially picks door 1 and the host opens door 3 is the probability for the event \"car is behind door 2 and host opens door 3\" divided by the probability for \"host opens door 3\" These probabilities can be determined referring to the conditional probability table below, or to an equivalent decision tree. The conditional probability of winning by switching is 1/3/1/3 + 1/6, which is 2/3.\n\nBayes' theorem\n--------------\n\nMany probability text books and articles in the field of probability theory derive the conditional probability solution through a formal application of Bayes' theorem; among them books by Gill and Henze. Use of the odds form of Bayes' theorem, often called Bayes' rule, makes such a derivation more transparent.\n\nStrategic dominance solution\n---------------------------\n\nGoing back to Nalebuff, the Monty Hall problem is also much studied in the literature on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions correspond to this point of view. Savant asks for a decision, not a chance, and the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown. From this point of view, one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch. Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.\n\nSolutions by simulation\n----------------------\n\nA simple way to demonstrate that a switching strategy really does win two out of three times with the standard assumptions is to simulate the game with playing cards. Three cards from an ordinary deck are used to represent the three doors; one 'special' card represents the door with the car and two other cards represent the goat doors.\n\nVariants\n--------\n\nA common variant of the problem, assumed by several academic authors as the canonical problem, does not make the simplifying assumption that the host must uniformly choose the door to open, but instead that he uses some other strategy. The confusion as to which formalization is authoritative has led to considerable acrimony, particularly because this variant makes proofs more involved without altering the optimality of the always-switch strategy for the player. In this variant, the player can have different probabilities of winning depending on the observed choice of the host, but in any case the probability of winning by switching is at least 1/2 (and can be as high as 1), while the overall probability of winning by switching is still exactly 2/3. The variants are sometimes presented in succession in textbooks and articles intended to teach the basics of probability theory and game theory. A considerable number of other generalizations have also been studied.\n\nOther host behaviors\n---------------------\n\nThe version of the Monty Hall problem published in Parade in 1990 did not specifically state that the host would always open another door, or always offer a choice to switch, or even never open the door revealing the car. However, Savant made it clear in her second follow-up column that the intended host's behavior could only be what led to the 2/3 probability she gave as her original answer. \"Anything else is a different question.\" The answer follows if the car is placed randomly behind any door, the host must open a door revealing a goat regardless of the player's initial choice and, if two doors are available, chooses which one to open randomly. The table below shows a variety of other possible host behaviors and the impact on the success of switching.\n\nN doors\n--------\n\nD L Ferguson (1975 in a letter to Selvin) suggests an N-door generalization of the original problem in which the host opens p losing doors and then offers the player the opportunity to switch; in this variant switching wins with probability:\n\n1/N \\* (N-1)/(N-p-1)\n\nThis probability is always greater than 1/N, therefore switching always brings an advantage.\n\nQuantum version\n--------------\n\nA quantum version of the paradox illustrates some points about the relation between classical or non-quantum information and quantum information, as encoded in the states of quantum mechanical systems. The formulation is loosely based on quantum game theory. The three doors are replaced by a quantum system allowing three alternatives; opening a door and looking behind it is translated as making a particular measurement. The rules can be stated in this language, and once again the choice for the player is to stick with the initial choice, or change to another \"orthogonal\" option. The latter strategy turns out to double the chances, just as in the classical case. However, if the show host has not randomized the position of the prize in a fully quantum mechanical way, the player can do even better, and can sometimes even win the prize with certainty.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe earliest of several probability puzzles related to the Monty Hall problem is Bertrand's box paradox, posed by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités. In this puzzle, there are three boxes: a box containing two gold coins, a box with two silver coins, and a box with one of each. After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random that happens to be a gold coin, the question is what is the probability that the other coin is gold. As in the Monty Hall problem, the intuitive answer is 1/2, but the probability is actually 2/3.\n\nIn literature\n-------------\n\nAndrew Crumey's novel Mr Mee (2000) contains a version of the Monty Hall problem set in the 18th century. In Chapter 1, it is presented as a shell game that a prisoner must win in order to save his life. In Chapter 8, the philosopher Rosier, his student Tissot, and Tissot's wife test the probabilities by simulation and verify the counter-intuitive result. They then perform an experiment involving black and white beads resembling the boy or girl paradox, and in a humorous allusion to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, Rosier erroneously concludes that \"as soon as I saw my own bead, a wave of pure probability flew, instantaneously, from one end of the room to the other. This accounted for the sudden change from two thirds to a half, as a finite quantum of probability (of weight one sixth) passed miraculously between the beads, launched by my own act of observation.\" Rosier explains his theory to Tissot, but \"His poor grasp of my theories emerged some days later when, his sister being about to give birth, Tissot paid for a baby girl to be sent into the room, believing it would make the new child twice as likely to be born male. My pupil however gained a niece; and I found no difficulty in explaining the fallacy of his reasoning Tissot had merely misunderstood my remarkable Paradox of the Twins, which states that if a boy tells you he has a sibling, then the probability of it being a sister is not a half, but two thirds.\" This is followed by a version of the unexpected hanging paradox.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nSimilar puzzles in probability and decision theory\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Monty_Hall_problem\" following this outline:\n\n\nParadox\nSteve Selvin wrote a letter to the American Statistician in 1975, describing a problem based on the game show Let's Make a Deal, [1] dubbing it the \"Monty Hall problem\" in a subsequent letter [2] The problem is equivalent mathematically to the Three Prisoners problem described in Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American in 1959 [7] and the Three Shells Problem described in Gardner's book Aha Gotcha [8]\n\n\nStandard assumptions\nBy the standard assumptions, the probability of winning the car after switching is ⁠2/3⁠.\nThis solution is due to the behavior of the host Ambiguities in the Parade version do not explicitly define the protocol of the host However, Marilyn vos Savant's solution [3] printed alongside Whitaker's question implies, and both Selvin [1] and Savant [5] explicitly define, the role of the host as follows:\n\n\nSimple solutions\nThe solution presented by Savant in Parade shows the three possible arrangements of one car and two goats behind three doors and the result of staying or switching after initially picking door 1 in each case: [11]\n\n\nSavant and the media furor\nYou blew it, and you blew it big!

one 'special' card represents the door with the car and two other cards represent the goat doors.\n\n\nVariants\nA common variant of the problem, assumed by several academic authors as the canonical problem, does not make the simplifying assumption that the host must uniformly choose the door to open, but instead that he uses some other strategy The confusion as to which formalization is authoritative has led to considerable acrimony, particularly because this variant makes proofs more involved without altering the optimality of the always-switch strategy for the player In this variant, the player can have different probabilities of winning depending on the observed choice of the host, but in any case the probability of winning by switching is at least ⁠1/2⁠ (and can be as high as 1), while the overall probability of winning by switching is still exactly ⁠2/3⁠ The variants are sometimes presented in succession in textbooks and articles intended to teach the basics of probability theory and game theory A considerable number of other generalizations have also been studied.\n\n\nOther host behaviors\nThe version of the Monty Hall problem published in Parade in 1990 did not specifically state that the host would always open another door, or always offer a choice to switch, or even never open the door revealing the car However, Savant made it clear in her second follow-up column that the intended host's behavior could only be what led to the ⁠2/3⁠ probability she gave as her original answer \"Anything else is a different question.\" [5] \"Virtually all of my critics understood the intended scenario I personally read nearly three thousand letters (out of the many additional thousands that arrived) and found nearly every one insisting simply that because two options remained (or an equivalent error), the chances were even Very few raised questions about ambiguity, and the letters actually published in the column were not among those few.\" [60] The answer follows if the car is placed randomly behind any door, the host must open a door revealing a goat regardless of the player's initial choice and, if two doors are available, chooses which one to open randomly [9] The table below shows a variety of other possible host behaviors and the impact on the success of switching.\n\n\nN doors\nD L Ferguson (1975 in a letter to Selvin [2]) suggests an N-door generalization of the original problem in which the host opens p losing doors and then offers the player the opportunity to switch; in this variant switching wins with probability \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n⋅\n\n\n\nN\n−\n1\n\n\nN\n−\np\n−\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{N}}\\cdot {\\frac {N-1}{N-p-1}}}\n\n This probability is always greater than \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nN\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{N}}}\n\n, therefore switching always brings an advantage.\n\n\nQuantum version\nA quantum version of the paradox illustrates some points about the relation between classical or non-quantum information and quantum information, as encoded in the states of quantum mechanical systems The formulation is loosely based on quantum game theory The three doors are replaced by a quantum system allowing three alternatives; opening a door and looking behind it is translated as making a particular measurement The rules can be stated in this language, and once again the choice for the player is to stick with the initial choice, or change to another \"orthogonal\" option The latter strategy turns out to double the chances, just as in the classical case However, if the show host has not randomized the position of the prize in a fully quantum mechanical way, the player can do even better, and can sometimes even win the prize with certainty [65] [66]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest of several probability puzzles related to the Monty Hall problem is Bertrand's box paradox, posed by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités [67] In this puzzle, there are three boxes: a box containing two gold coins, a box with two silver coins, and a box with one of each After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random that happens to be a gold coin, the question is what is the probability that the other coin is gold As in the Monty Hall problem, the intuitive answer is ⁠1/2⁠, but the probability is actually ⁠2/3⁠.\n\n\nIn literature\nAndrew Crumey's novel Mr Mee (2000) contains a version of the Monty Hall problem set in the 18th century In Chapter 1 it is presented as a shell game that a prisoner must win in order to save his life In Chapter 8 the philosopher Rosier, his student Tissot and Tissot's wife test the probabilities by simulation and verify the counter-intuitive result They then perform an experiment involving black and white beads resembling the boy or girl paradox, and in a humorous allusion to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, Rosier erroneously concludes that \"as soon as I saw my own bead, a wave of pure probability flew, instantaneously, from one end of the room to the other This accounted for the sudden change from two thirds to a half, as a finite quantum of probability (of weight one sixth) passed miraculously between the beads, launched by my own act of observation.\" [71] Rosier explains his theory to Tissot, but \"His poor grasp of my theories emerged some days later when, his sister being about to give birth, Tissot paid for a baby girl to be sent into the room, believing it would make the new child twice as likely to be born male My pupil however gained a niece; and I found no difficulty in explaining the fallacy of his reasoning Tissot had merely misunderstood my remarkable Paradox of the Twins, which states that if a boy tells you he has a sibling, then the probability of it being a sister is not a half, but two thirds.\" [72] This is followed by a version of the unexpected hanging paradox.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSimilar puzzles in probability and decision theory\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Thomas**\n\nB.J. Thomas is an American singer, musician, and actor. Born Billy Joe Thomas on August 7, 1942, in Hugo, Oklahoma, he is best known for his hits in the 1960s and 1970s, including \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head.\"\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nBilly Joe Thomas was born in Hugo, Oklahoma, to Geneva and Vernon Thomas. He grew up in and around Houston, Texas, and graduated from Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas. Thomas's early life was marked by a love for music, which was encouraged by his parents.\n\nAs a young man, Thomas worked as a janitor and a singer in local bars and clubs in Houston. He began to develop his skills as a singer and songwriter, and in the early 1960s, he formed a band called The Triumphs. The band played a mix of rock and roll, country, and pop music, and Thomas's soulful voice and energetic stage presence quickly made him a local favorite.\n\n**Music career**\n\nIn 1966, Thomas and The Triumphs released their first album, \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\" on the Pacemaker Records label. The album featured a hit cover version of the Hank Williams song \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\" which sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. The follow-up single, \"Mama,\" peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard charts.\n\nThomas's solo career took off in 1968 with the song \"The Eyes of a New York Woman.\" Five months later, he released \"Hooked on a Feeling,\" which featured the sound of Reggie Young's electric sitar. The song was first released on the album \"On My Way\" via Scepter Records and became Thomas's second million-selling record.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Thomas released a string of hit singles and albums, including \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,\" \"New Looks from an Old Lover,\" and \"Two Car Garage.\" He also appeared on television shows, including \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The Tonight Show.\"\n\n**1960s–1970s**\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thomas's music became more experimental, incorporating elements of rock, country, and folk. He released several albums, including \"On My Way,\" \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,\" and \"New Looks from an Old Lover.\" The albums were moderately successful, but Thomas's live performances continued to draw large crowds.\n\nThomas's music also became more introspective, reflecting his growing interest in spirituality and his experiences as a musician. He released several albums that explored these themes, including \"Home Is Where the Heart Is\" and \"Throwing Rocks at the Moon.\"\n\n**1980s–2010s**\n\nIn the 1980s, Thomas's music career slowed down, but he continued to release new material. He had little success on the pop charts, but some of his singles topped the country singles chart. Two of those songs included \"Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love\" and \"New Looks from an Old Lover\" in 1983. Additionally, \"Two Car Garage\" reached No. 3 on the country charts.\n\nIn 1981, on his 39th birthday, Thomas became the 60th member of the Grand Ole Opry. His Opry membership later lapsed, with the Opry classifying him as a non-regular \"guest artist.\" He scored another hit, recording \"As Long as We Got Each Other,\" the theme song for the television series \"Growing Pains.\" The first-season theme was a solo for Thomas; it was re-recorded as a duet with Jennifer Warnes for the second and third seasons. For the show's fourth season, it was re-recorded with British singer Dusty Springfield, however the Thomas/Warnes version was used for season five and part of season seven Thomas first released the track on his 1985 album \"Throwing Rocks at the Moon\" via Columbia Records.\n\n**Personal life and death**\n\nThomas married singer-songwriter Gloria Richardson in December 1968. They had three daughters: Paige (born in 1970), Nora (adopted from North Korea in 1978), and Erin (born in 1979).\n\nThomas passed away on May 29, 2021, at the age of 78, due to complications from lung cancer.\n\n**Selective discography**\n\n* \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" (1966)\n* \"On My Way\" (1968)\n* \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head\" (1969)\n* \"New Looks from an Old Lover\" (1970)\n* \"Throwing Rocks at the Moon\" (1985)\n* \"As Long as We Got Each Other\" (1985)\n\n**Awards and nominations**\n\nThomas was nominated for several awards, including multiple Grammy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.

end of the series' run, Adam returns and announces that Black Adam and Theo Adam are separate personalities Black Adam stands trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and is acquitted when it is revealed that his fingerprints do not match those of Theo Adam.\n\n\nJSA: Black Reign\nIn JSA #45 (2003), Black Adam and his teammate Atom Smasher both defect from the Justice Society, expressing dissatisfaction with the team's refusal to cross certain lines During the next few issues, Adam forms his own organization, which administers justice the way Adam wants it: \"an eye for an eye\" His

old homeland of Kahndaq, now ruled by a militant dictator whose actions had long been ignored by the United Nations.\n\n\nInfinite Crisis\nBlack Adam is featured heavily in DC's 2005 Infinite Crisis crossover, primarily in the Villains United miniseries as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains (which he only joins to protect Kahndaq from the Society) Concurrently, in JSA, Atom Smasher leaves Adam's side to return to the JSA.\n\n\n52\nBlack Adam appears as a featured character in DC's weekly 52 comic book Depicted as the violent protector of the nation of Kahndaq, Adam kills several

Sivana while listening to witness reports of the wizard Shazam Sivana mentions that Black Adam was a slave who was teleported from his prison cell to the Rock of Eternity and granted his powers by the wizard Adam then went on to save Kahndaq from the Seven Deadly Sins before vanishing During Dr Sivana's explanation, drawings of Black Adam are shown in a historical text, displaying a slightly different look from his previous incarnations [17] Dr Sivana later uses his new-found magic eye inside of some ruins to read a magically hidden hieroglyph that makes the wall explode, releasing Black Adam from his tomb Adam is then shown in a revamped version of his original costume, which includes a cape, hood, and a metallic belt instead of a sash His lightning bolt appears as an opening into his body with magical energy visibly inside of him [18]\n\n\nDC Rebirth (2016–2018)\nIn 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called \"DC Rebirth\", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to \"The New 52\" Black Adam appears in the Dark Nights: Metal miniseries He is revealed to be a member of the Council of the Immortals, a group with the oldest beings of Earth, such as Vandal Savage and Hawkgirl Black Adam supposedly kills Doctor Fate at the Rock of Eternity while in a fight against him, Wonder Woman, and Hawkgirl, who is by that point transformed by Barbatos into an evil version of herself named Lady Blackhawk [26]\n\n\nNew Justice (2018-2021)\nDuring the \"Endless Winter\" storyline, Black Adam was once freed in the 10th century by Hippolyta, Swamp Thing, and Viking Prince to help deal with the Frost King [38] When Flash is attacked by the Frost King's ice monsters, he is saved by Black Adam [39] Black Adam, Silver Banshee, Catman, Icicle, Rampage, and Multiplex arrive at the Stagg Enterprises facility in Gotham City where Frost King's family is kept in stasis Multiplex tries helping Black Adam, but he overexhausts himself and Frost King kills Multiplex Black Adam threatens to kill Frost King's family While Frost King is distracted, Sebastian Stagg sends out a robot that can fire cold fusion cannons, but it makes the Frost King stronger instead Just before Black Adam is killed, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Batman, and Green Lantern arrive [40] When it turns out that the Frost King's real body was trapped in the Fortress of Solitude, Superman prevents Black Adam from killing him When the Frost King is seemingly destroyed in an explosion, Black Adam leaves while swearing vengeance on Superman [41]\n\n\nInfinite Frontier (2021–2023)\nIn Infinite Frontier, Black Adam joins the Justice League and attempts to turn over a new leaf, harkening back to the lessons Adrianna had taught him He began acting more as a protector than an avenger, which attracted the attention of Superman, who believed that the Justice League needed fresh perspectives.\n\n\nDawn of DC (2023-20??)\nAs an ordinary human being, Black Adam is a skilled martial artist In more recent interpretations of the character, he is expressed to be a master of Dhritishastra, a fictional Indian combat system created by Vandal Savage in which can only be mastered by those possessing immortality due to its complexity [42] Furthermore, Black Adam's intimidating presence and formidable abilities have led to his induction into the Sinestro Corps The Sinestro Corps, an organization of fear-based warriors, recognized Black Adam as a suitable member due to his ability to inspire fear in others and his capacity to instill terror on the battlefield [43]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nAs an ordinary human being, Black Adam is a skilled martial artist In more recent interpretations of the character, he is expressed to be a

American comic books published by DC Comics. He first appeared in The Marvel Family #1 (1945) and was created by writer Bill Parker and artist C.C. Beck.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBlack Adam is a powerful and complex character with a rich history in the DC Comics universe. Originally introduced as a villain, he has evolved over the years to become a nuanced and multifaceted character with a deep sense of morality and a strong sense of justice. This article will explore the character's history, powers, and abilities, as well as his various incarnations and adaptations in different media.\n\n**Fawcett Comics**\n\nThe canon version of Black Adam appeared only once during Fawcett's initial publication run of Captain Marvel comics. In The Marvel Family #1, Black Adam is an ancient Egyptian named Teth-Adam (i.e., \"Mighty Human\"), who is chosen by the wizard Shazam to be his successor due to his presumed moral purity. This story is reprinted in DC's Shazam! #8 (1973), which is his first appearance in the Bronze Age.\n\n**DC Comics**\n\nAlthough Adam is defeated in the same story which he debuted, the DC version of Adam is resurrected and revitalized nearly 30 years later in Philadelphia by Doctor Sivana's reincarnation machine in DC Comics' Shazam! revival of the Marvel Family characters. He then destroys the machine so it cannot be used against him, much to Sivana's annoyance.\n\n**Pre-Crisis**\n\nThough Adam is defeated in the same story which he debuted, the DC version of Adam is resurrected and revitalized nearly 30 years later in Philadelphia by Doctor Sivana's reincarnation machine in DC Comics' Shazam! revival of the Marvel Family characters. He then destroys the machine so it cannot be used against him, much to Sivana's annoyance.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nBlack Adam is reintroduced to the DC Universe in The Power of Shazam! graphic novel by Jerry Ordway in 1994 (an earlier Post-Crisis version of the character appeared in Shazam!: The New Beginning but this appearance is not considered canonical). In that story and the subsequent Power of Shazam! ongoing series, Adam is a deadly and evil adversary for Captain Marvel.\n\n**The Power of Shazam!: Revised Origin**\n\nBlack Adam is reintroduced to the DC Universe in The Power of Shazam! graphic novel by Jerry Ordway in 1994 (an earlier Post-Crisis version of the character appeared in Shazam!: The New Beginning but this appearance is not considered canonical). In that story and the subsequent Power of Shazam! ongoing series, Adam is a deadly and evil adversary for Captain Marvel.\n\n**JSA Series: Black Adam Reforms**\n\nAlthough Adam appears during the Power of Shazam! ongoing series' first year of publication as a villain, towards the end of the series' run, Adam returns and announces that Black Adam and Theo Adam are separate personalities. Black Adam stands trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and is acquitted when it is revealed that his fingerprints do not match those of Theo Adam.\n\n**JSA: Black Reign**\n\nIn JSA #45 (2003), Black Adam and his teammate Atom Smasher both defect from the Justice Society, expressing dissatisfaction with the team's refusal to cross certain lines. During the next few issues, Adam forms his own organization, which administers justice the way Adam wants it: \"an eye for an eye\". His roster includes a mix of DC heroes and villains, including Atom Smasher, Brainwave (who is possessed by Mister Mind), Northwind and the rest of the society of Feithera, Nemesis, and former JSA museum curator Alex Montez, the human host of the demon Eclipso. Adam's collective executes Kobra, a villain who has been acquitted by the legal system (albeit because his followers had threatened to blow themselves up if he was not released) when the JSA could have spared them his escape and the hassle of a trial by simply killing Kobra when he was first captured. Adam then turns his attentions to his old homeland of Kahndaq, now ruled by a militant dictator whose actions had long been ignored by the United Nations.\n\n**Infinite Crisis**\n\nBlack Adam is featured heavily in DC's 2005 Infinite Crisis crossover, primarily in the Villains United miniseries as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains (which he only joins to protect Kahndaq from the Society). Concurrently, in JSA, Atom Smasher leaves Adam's side to return to the JSA.\n\n**52**\n\nBlack Adam appears as a featured character in DC's weekly 52 comic book. Depicted as the violent protector of the nation of Kahndaq, Adam kills several supervillains in public and on television to demonstrate his views. As a result, he is distrusted by the superhuman community.\n\n**World War III**\n\nAfter the funeral in honor of his family, Adam attacks the neighboring Intergang-associated nation of Bialya in search of Death. Sick with grief over the death of his family, Adam proceeds to exterminate the entire 2,000,000-citizen population of Bialya in his hunt for his target. Upon confronting his family's killer, the enraged Adam battles a greatly enhanced Death, who has been feeding on the slaughter of Bialya's population. Despite his enhanced strength, Death is defeated by Adam with a barrage of mystic lightning. While torturing Death for an entire day, Adam learns the identity and whereabouts of the Horsemen's masters, flying off to Oolong Island in search of the Science Squad.\n\n**Countdown/Black Adam: The Dark Age**\n\nBlack Adam's quest to gain his powers back between the events of 52 and Countdown was depicted in a six-issue miniseries entitled Black Adam: The Dark Age, published from late 2007 to early 2008. Sometime after his defeat in World War III, Adam gathers a small band of Kahndaqi men who still remain loyal to Adam and sneaks into a heavily guarded and war-torn Kahndaq in disguise (having had his minions beat him mercilessly to alter his appearance) to retrieve the bones of Isis. The men kill the guards at the tomb, and get Isis's remains.\n\n**Final Crisis**\n\nBlack Adam is featured in Final Crisis #5, assisting a small group of Earth's heroes, many of whom he fought before, in battling against Darkseid's forces. Adam battles Mary Marvel and perceives a \"leering old man\" inside of her. He attempts to kill her but is stopped by Tawky Tawny and Shazam (Freddy Freeman). Adam is subdued by enemy forces.\n\n**Justice Society of America**\n\nA brooding, disparaged Black Adam appears in Justice Society of America vol 3 #16 (2008), hiding in the tomb of Isis and Osiris and killing potential looters, along with sleeping in the coffins. He reveals through narration that the whole meaning of his power transfer to Mary Marvel was the hope that her innocence would eventually force Mary into surrendering back his power to him, but changed enough to allow Isis's rebirth. After the attempt failed, Adam returned to his state of mourning and anger. Adam's mourning is cut short, however, when he discovers a bloodied flower in his shrine, believing it a sign from Isis.\n\n**The New 52 (2011–2016)**\n\nIn The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Black Adam was mentioned by Dr Sivana while listening to witness reports of the wizard Shazam. Sivana mentions that Black Adam was a slave who was teleported from his prison cell to the Rock of Eternity and granted his powers by the wizard Adam then went on to save Kahndaq from the Seven Deadly Sins before vanishing. During Dr Sivana's explanation, drawings of Black Adam are shown in a historical text, displaying a slightly different look from his previous incarnations. Dr Sivana later uses his new-found magic eye inside of some ruins to read a magically hidden hieroglyph that makes the wall explode, releasing Black Adam from his tomb. Adam is then shown in a revamped version of his original costume, which includes a cape, hood, and a metallic belt instead of a sash. His lightning bolt appears as an opening into his body with magical energy visibly inside of him.\n\n**DC Rebirth (2016–2018)**\n\nIn 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called \"DC Rebirth\", which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to \"The New 52\". Black Adam appears in the Dark Nights: Metal miniseries. He is revealed to be a member of the Council of the Immortals, a group with the oldest beings of Earth, such as Vandal Savage and Hawkgirl. Black Adam supposedly kills Doctor Fate at the Rock of Eternity while in a fight against him, Wonder Woman, and Hawkgirl, who is by that point transformed by Barbatos into an evil version of herself named Lady Blackhawk.\n\n**New Justice (2018-2021)**\n\nDuring the \"Endless Winter\" storyline, Black Adam was once freed in the 10th century by Hippolyta, Swamp Thing, and Viking Prince to help deal with the Frost King. When Flash is attacked by the Frost King's ice monsters, he is saved by Black Adam. Black Adam, Silver Banshee, Catman, Icicle, Rampage, and Multiplex arrive at the Stagg Enterprises facility in Gotham City where Frost King's family is kept in stasis. Multiplex tries helping Black Adam, but he overexhausts himself and Frost King kills Multiplex. Black Adam threatens to kill Frost King's family. While Frost King is distracted, Sebastian Stagg sends out a robot that can fire cold fusion cannons, but it makes the Frost King stronger instead. Just before Black Adam is killed, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Batman, and Green Lantern arrive. When it turns out that the Frost King's real body was trapped in the Fortress of Solitude, Superman prevents Black Adam from killing him. When the Frost King is seemingly destroyed in an explosion, Black Adam leaves while swearing vengeance on Superman.\n\n**Infinite Frontier (2021–2023)**\n\nIn Infinite Frontier, Black Adam joins the Justice League and attempts to turn over a new leaf, harkening back to the lessons Adrianna had taught him. He began acting more as a protector than an avenger, which attracted the attention of Superman, who believed that the Justice League needed fresh perspectives.\n\n**Dawn of DC (2023-20??)**\n\nAs an ordinary human being, Black Adam is a skilled martial artist. In more recent interpretations of the character, he is expressed to be a master of Dhritishastra, a fictional Indian combat system created by Vandal Savage in which can only be mastered by those possessing immortality due to its complexity. Furthermore, Black Adam's intimidating presence and formidable abilities have led to his induction into the Sinestro Corps. The Sinestro Corps, an organization of fear-based warriors, recognized Black Adam as a suitable member due to his ability to inspire fear in others and his capacity to instill terror on the battlefield.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nAs an ordinary human being, Black Adam is a skilled martial artist.

The Sinestro Corps, an organization of fear-based warriors, recognized Black Adam as a suitable member due to his ability to inspire fear in others and his capacity to instill terror on the battlefield.\n\n**Powers of Shazam**\n\nLike Captain Marvel/Shazam, Black Adam possesses the ability to undergo a transformation by uttering the word \"SHAZAM.\" Through this transformation, he gains the powers and attributes of six divine entities. However, in contrast to his nemesis, Black Adam's powers derive from Egyptian deities and their associated attributes. These divine entities bestow upon him a similar set of powers and abilities. While in his empowered form, he is considered to be among the most dangerous beings on the planet possessing \"Alpha-level\" powers. These abilities also grant him a heightened level of senses, having been able to once smell Felix Faust's sweat.\n\n**Traditional Combination**\n\nHe gains the powers of Isis, the goddess of magic and fertility; Hawkman, the god of war and protection; Dr. Fate, the god of wisdom and knowledge; the Egyptian god of the underworld, Anubis; the Greek god of the underworld, Hades; and the god of the wind, Horus. In his empowered form, he can fly, is nearly invulnerable to physical damage, and has superhuman strength, speed, and agility.\n\n**New 52 Combination**\n\nIn the New 52 continuity, he gains the powers of Ra, the Egyptian sun god; Isis, the goddess of magic and fertility; Horus, the god of the wind; Anubis, the god of the underworld; Nephthys, the goddess of death; and Zehut, the god of the earth.\n\n**Other Versions**\n\nIn other media, Black Adam's powers have been depicted differently. In the animated series \"Young Justice,\" he gains the powers of Ankh, the Egyptian god of life; Horus, the god of the wind; Isis, the goddess of magic and fertility; Nephthys, the goddess of death; and Zehut, the god of the earth. In the animated series \"Justice League Unlimited,\" he gains the powers of Anubis, the god of the underworld; Horus, the god of the wind; Isis, the goddess of magic and fertility; Nephthys, the goddess of death; and Zehut, the god of the earth.\n\n**Infinite Frontier Combination**\n\nIn the Infinite Frontier continuity, he gains the powers of Ra, the Egyptian sun god; Isis, the goddess of magic and fertility; Horus, the god of the wind; Anubis, the god of the underworld; Nephthys, the goddess of death; and Zehut, the god of the earth.\n\n**Television**\n\nBlack Adam has appeared in several animated television series, including \"The Adventures of Superboy\", \"Superboy: The Animated Series\", and \"Justice League Unlimited\".

I can't define 'star quality,' but whatever it is, Mr Gibson has it.\" [26] Gibson has also been likened to \"a combination Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart.\" [27] Gibson's roles in the Mad Max series of films, Peter Weir's Gallipoli (1981), and the Lethal Weapon series of films earned him the label of \"action hero\" [28]\n\n\nOverview\nGibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars In 1982, Vincent Canby wrote that \"Mr Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen..

of films, Peter Weir's Gallipoli (1981), and the Lethal Weapon series of films earned him the label of \"action hero\" [28]\n\n\nActing\nGibson studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney [30] As students, Gibson and actress Judy Davis played the leads in Romeo and Juliet, and Gibson played the role of Queen Titania in an experimental production of A Midsummer Night's Dream [31]

Sound of Freedom, a film based on a true story which revolves around the topic of trafficking of children [52]\n\n\nDirecting\nAccording to Robert Downey Jr., studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing, an idea he rebuffed at the time [53] Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with The Man Without a Face, followed two years later by Braveheart, which earned Gibson the Academy Award for Best Director Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of Fahrenheit 451, but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts [54] Gibson was scheduled to direct Robert Downey Jr in a Los Angeles stage production of Hamlet in January 2001, but Downey's drug relapse ended the project [55] In 2002, while promoting We Were Soldiers and Signs to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning to pare back on acting and return to directing [56] In September 2002, Gibson announced that he would direct a film called The Passion in Aramaic and Latin with no subtitles because he hoped to \"transcend language barriers with filmic storytelling.\" [57]\n\n\nDirecting style\nGibson has credited his directors, particularly George Miller, Peter Weir, and Richard Donner, with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director As a director, Gibson sometimes breaks the tension on set by having his actors perform serious scenes wearing a red clown nose [76] Helena Bonham Carter said of him, \"He has a very basic sense of humor It's a bit lavatorial and not very sophisticated.\" [77] Gibson inserted a single frame of himself smoking a cigarette into the 2005 teaser trailer of Apocalypto [78]\n\n\nFilm work\nGibson's screen acting career began in 1976, with a role on the Australian television series The Sullivans In his career, Gibson has appeared in 43 films, including the Mad Max and Lethal Weapon film series In addition to acting, Gibson has also directed four films, including Braveheart and The

filmography includes television series, feature films, television films, and animated films.\n\n\nMad Max series\nGibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic survivor in George Miller's Mad Max The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star In the United States, the actors' Australian accents were dubbed with American accents [81] The original film spawned two sequels: Mad Max 2 (known in North America as The Road Warrior) and Mad Max 3 (known in North America as Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome) A fourth movie, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), was made with Tom Hardy in the title role [82]\n\n\nGallipoli\nThe 1981 Peter Weir film Gallipoli is about a group of young men from rural Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I They are sent to invade the Ottoman Empire, where they take part in the 1915 Gallipoli campaign During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the war The climax of the movie centers on the catastrophic Australian offensive known as the Battle of the Nek.\n\n\nThe Year of Living Dangerously\nGibson played a naïve but ambitious journalist opposite Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt in Peter Weir's atmospheric 1982 film The Year of Living Dangerously, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Koch The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr Gibson, then nothing will He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence.\" [86] According to John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph, the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent [87]\n\n\nThe Bounty\nGibson followed the footsteps of Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the Bounty The resulting 1984 film The Bounty is considered to be the most historically accurate version However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist He has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film [88]\n\n\nLethal Weapon series\nGibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular action comedy film series Lethal Weapon, which began with the 1987 original In the films he played LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a recently widowed Vietnam veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and starting with the second film, they're joined by a hyperactive informant named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) Following the success of Lethal Weapon, director Richard Donner and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Lethal Weapon 3 (1993), and Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) With its fourth installment, the Lethal Weapon series embodied \"the quintessence of the buddy cop pic\" [89]\n\n\nHamlet\nGibson made the unusual transition from action to classical drama, playing William Shakespeare's Danish prince in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet Gibson was cast alongside experienced Shakespearean actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield He compared working with Scofield to being \"thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson\" [94] Scofield said of Gibson \"Not the sort of actor you'd think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence.\" [95]\n\n\nBraveheart\nIn 1995, Gibson directed, produced, and starred in Braveheart, a biographical film of Sir William Wallace, a Scottish nationalist who was executed in 1305 for \"high treason\" against King Edward I of England Gibson received two Academy Awards, Best Director and Best Picture, for his second directorial effort In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so [96] Braveheart influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the Battle of Stirling Bridge sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time best-directed battle scenes [97]\n\n\nThe Passion of the Christ\nGibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the film The Passion of the Christ (2004), which chronicled the passion and death of Jesus (Jim Caviezel) The film was shot exclusively in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles, but eventually relented for theatrical exhibition The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence The Anti-Defamation League accused Gibson of antisemitism over the film's unflattering depiction of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin.\n\n\nApocalypto\nGibson received further critical acclaim for his directing of the 2006 action-adventure film Apocalypto [115] Gibson's fourth directorial effort is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century against the turbulent end times of a Maya civilization The sparse dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language by a cast of Native American descent [116] [117]\n\n\nThe Beaver\nGibson starred in The Beaver, a domestic drama about a depressed alcoholic directed by former Maverick costar Jodie Foster [120] The Beaver premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on March 16, 2011 The opening weekend in 22 theaters was considered a flop; it made $104,000 which comes to a per-theater average of $4,745 [121] The film's distributor, Summit Entertainment, had originally planned for a wide release of The Beaver for the weekend of May 20, but after the initial box-office returns for the film, the company changed course and decided instead to give the film a \"limited art-house run\" [122] Michael Cieply of The New York Times observed on June 5, 2011, that the film had cleared just about $1 million, making it a certified \"flop\" [123] Director Jodie Foster opined that the film did not do well with American audiences because it was a dramedy, and \"very often Americans are not comfortable with  [that]\" [124]\n\n\nHacksaw Ridge\nIn 2014, Gibson signed on to direct Hacksaw Ridge, a World War II drama based on the true story of conscientious objector Desmond T Doss, played by Andrew Garfield [127] The

The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by MGM studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr Gibson, then nothing will He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence.\"\n\n**The Bounty**\n\nGibson followed the footsteps of Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The resulting 1984 film The Bounty is considered to be the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist. Gibson has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film.\n\n**Lethal Weapon series**\n\nGibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular action comedy film series Lethal Weapon, which began with the 1987 original. In the films, he played LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a recently widowed Vietnam veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and starting with the second film, they're joined by a hyperactive informant named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). Following the success of Lethal Weapon, director Richard Donner and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Lethal Weapon 3 (1993), and Lethal Weapon 4 (1998).\n\n**Hamlet**\n\nGibson made the unusual transition from action to classical drama, playing William Shakespeare's Danish prince in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet. Gibson was cast alongside experienced Shakespearean actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield. He compared working with Scofield to being \"thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson.\" Scofield said of Gibson \"Not the sort of actor you'd think would make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence.\"\n\n**Braveheart**\n\nIn 1995, Gibson directed, produced, and starred in Braveheart, a biographical film of Sir William Wallace, a Scottish nationalist who was executed in 1305 for \"high treason\" against King Edward I of England. Gibson received two Academy Awards, Best Director and Best Picture, for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so. Braveheart influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the Battle of Stirling Bridge sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time best-directed battle scenes.\n\n**The Passion of the Christ**\n\nGibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the film The Passion of the Christ (2004), which chronicled the passion and death of Jesus (Jim Caviezel). The film was shot exclusively in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew. Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles, but eventually relented for theatrical exhibition. The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence. The Anti-Defamation League accused Gibson of antisemitism over the film's unflattering depiction of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin.\n\n**Apocalypto**\n\nGibson received further critical acclaim for his directing of the 2006 action-adventure film Apocalypto. Gibson's fourth directorial effort is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century against the turbulent end times of a Maya civilization. The sparse dialogue is spoken in the Yucatec Maya language by a cast of Native American descent.\n\n**The Beaver**\n\nGibson starred in The Beaver, a domestic drama about a depressed alcoholic directed by former Maverick costar Jodie Foster. The Beaver premiered at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas on March 16, 2011. The opening weekend in 22 theaters was considered a flop; it made $104,000 which comes to a per-theater average of $4,745. The film's distributor, Summit Entertainment, had originally planned for a wide release of The Beaver for the weekend of May 20, but after the initial box-office returns for the film, the company changed course and decided instead to give the film a \"limited art-house run.\"\n\n**Hacksaw Ridge**\n\nIn 2014, Gibson signed on to direct Hacksaw Ridge, a World War II drama based on the true story of conscientious objector Desmond T Doss, played by Andrew Garfield. The film premiered at the 73rd Venice Film Festival in September 2016 and received what The New Zealand Herald calls \"rave reviews.\" It has won or been nominated for many awards, including Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Director for Gibson, and Best Actor for Garfield. Hacksaw Ridge was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGibson met Robyn Denise Moore in 1977, soon after filming Mad Max, in Adelaide, South Australia.

On June 7, 1980, Mel and Robyn were married in a Catholic church in Forestville, New South Wales.

According to Cris Embleton, one of the founders, the Gibsons gave millions to provide lifesaving medical treatment to needy children worldwide.\n\n**Religious and Political Views**\n\nGibson was raised a sedevacantist traditionalist Catholic, who reject the validity of all Popes since the Second Vatican Council and hold that the Holy See is currently vacant.

Lloyd's of London has rejected me 37 times so if you hear the rumor that they insure anybody, don't pay too much attention to it.\" [22]  Four years later, a clause in Knievel's contract to jump 14 buses at Kings Island required a one-day $1 million liability insurance to the amusement park Lloyd's of London offered liability insurance for $17,500 [23] Knievel eventually paid $2,500 to a U.S.-based insurance company [23]\n\n\nJumps and records\nTo keep his name in the news, Knievel proposed his biggest stunt ever, a motorcycle jump across the Grand Canyon Just five months after his near-fatal crash in Las Vegas, Knievel performed another jump On May 25, 1968, in Scottsdale, Arizona, Knievel crashed while attempting to jump 15 Ford Mustangs Knievel ended up breaking his right leg and foot as a result of the crash.\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon jump\nAlthough Knievel never attempted to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, \"I don't care if they say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing off the edge of the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it I want to be the first If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there.\" For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.\n\n\nSnake River Canyon jump\nABC's Wide World of Sports was unwilling to pay the price Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he hired boxing promoter Bob Arum's company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed-circuit television and broadcast to movie theaters [31] Investors in the event took a substantial loss, including promoter Don E Branker, [32] as well as Vince McMahon of what was then called the World Wide Wrestling Federation [33] Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman's company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: first, the necessary financing for the jump, and second, the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America's premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps Knievel hired aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle to jump across the Snake River, and called it the Skycycle X-1 Malewicki's creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax On April 15, 1972, the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp The decision was then made to have Truax build two Skycycle X-2s, one to test and one for the actual jump Both the X-1 and the X-2 test vehicles went into the river.\n\n\nWembley jump\nAfter the Snake River jump, Knievel returned to motorcycle jumping with ABC's Wide World of Sports televising several jumps On May 26, 1975, in front of 90,000 people at Wembley Stadium in London, Knievel crashed while trying to land a jump over 13 redundant single-deck AEC Merlin buses (the term \"London Buses\" used in earlier publicity had led to the belief that the attempt was to be made over the higher and more traditional AEC Routemaster double-decker type) [citation needed]\n\n\nKings Island jump\nAfter recuperating, Knievel decided that he had spoken too soon and that he would continue jumping On October 25, 1975, Knievel jumped 14 Greyhound buses at Kings Island near Cincinnati, Ohio Although Knievel landed on the safety deck above the 14th bus, his landing was successful and he held the record for jumping the most buses on a Harley-Davidson for 24 years (until broken by Bubba Blackwell in late 1999 with 15 at 157 feet (48 m)) The Kings Island event scored the highest viewer ratings in the history of ABC's Wide World of Sports and would serve as Knievel's longest successful jump at 133 feet (41 m) (although the Caesars Palace jump was longer, it ended in a crash) In the end, Knievel was featured in seven of the ten highest-rated episodes of ABC's Wide World of Sports After the Kings Island jump, Knievel again announced his retirement.\n\n\nShark jump\nOn January 31, 1977, Knievel was scheduled for a major jump in Chicago, Illinois The jump was inspired by the 1975 film Jaws Knievel was scheduled to jump a tank full of live sharks which would be televised live nationally However, during his rehearsal, Knievel lost control of the motorcycle and crashed into a cameraman [41] Although Knievel broke his arms, he was more distraught over what he claimed was a permanent eye injury to cameraman Thomas Geren The cameraman was admitted to the hospital and received treatment for an injury near his eye, but received no permanent injury The footage of this crash was so upsetting to Knievel that he did not show the clip for 19 years until the documentary Absolute Evel: The Evel Knievel Story.\n\n\nFeature movies: Evel Knievel and Viva Knievel!\nA 1971 biopic film, Evel Knievel, fictionalized Knievel's life and exploits Knievel, portrayed by George Hamilton, calls himself \"the last gladiator in the new Rome\" in a nod to a January 1970 Esquire magazine article about the stunt rider, whose author, David Lyle, declared, \"Evel Knievel  [...] may be the last great gladiator.\" (Later, Knievel titled his 1988 self-produced documentary Last of the Gladiators.) A higher end B-movie, Evel Knievel was a minor hit, taking in $4 million in rentals [42] [43] (equivalent to approximately $30,093,673 in 2023 [44]) against a $450,000 budget [45]\n\n\nMotorcycles\nKnievel briefly used a Honda 250cc motorcycle to jump a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions, his first known jump Knievel then used a Norton Motorcycle Company 750cc for only one year, 1966 Between 1967 and 1968, Knievel jumped using the Triumph Bonneville T120 (with a 650cc engine) Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New Year's Eve 1967 When Knievel returned to jumping after the crash, he used Triumph for the remainder of 1968.\n\n\nLeather jumpsuits\nThroughout his daredevil career, Knievel was known for his leather jumpsuits that were compared to the jumpsuits worn by Elvis Presley When Knievel began jumping, he used a black and yellow jumpsuit When he switched to the Triumph motorcycle, his jumpsuit changed to a white suit with stripes down the legs and sleeves In interviews, he said the reason for the switch was because he saw how Liberace had become not just a performer, but the epitome of what a showman should be, and Knievel sought to create his variation of that showmanship in his jumps [48] Two variations of the white suit appeared (one with three stars across the chest and one with the three stars on his right chest) The latter was worn at the Caesars Palace jump [49]\n\n\nCore values\nEvel Knievel took great pride in his core values Throughout his career and later life he would repeatedly talk about the importance of \"keeping his word\" [50] He stated that although he knew he might not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would Before the canyon jump, Knievel stated, \"If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word.\" [citation needed]\n\n\nAnti-drug campaign\nKnievel would regularly share his anti-drug message, one of his core values [51] Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts.\n\n\nMotorcycle helmet safety\nKnievel was a proponent of motorcycle helmet safety He constantly encouraged his fans to wear motorcycle helmets The Bell Star helmet he used in the Caesars Palace jump is credited for having saved Knievel's life after he fell off the motorcycle and struck his head on the ground [49] (Following the Caesars Palace crash, each of Knievel's full-face helmets bore the slogan, \"Color Me Lucky.\") Knievel once offered a cash reward for anyone who witnessed him stunting on a motorcycle without a helmet [52]\n\n\nMarketing image\nKnievel sought to make more money from his image He was no longer satisfied with just receiving free motorcycles to jump with Knievel wanted to be paid to use and promote a company's brand of motorcycles After Triumph, the British motorcycle brand he had been jumping with, refused to meet his demands (it was part of the bankrupt BSA group that was merged with Norton in 1972), Knievel started to propose the idea to other manufacturers American Eagle Motorcycles, the brand under which Italian Laverda machines were sold in the US, was the first company to sign Knievel to an endorsement deal Knievel then used the new lightweight racing motorcycle Harley-Davidson XR-750 from December 1970 until his final jump in January 1977.\n\n\nIdeal Toys\nBetween 1972 and 1977, Ideal Toy Company released a series of Evel Knievel-related merchandise, designed initially by Joseph M Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates During the six years the toys were manufactured, Ideal claimed to have sold more than $125 million worth of Knievel toys [55] The toys included the original 1972 figures, which offered various outfits and accessories In 1973, Ideal released the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle After the release of the Stunt Cycle, the Knievel toys were the best-selling item for Ideal [56]\n\n\nOther television appearances\nIn the 1970s, Knievel partnered with AMF to release a series of bicycles, marketed with TV ads [60]\n\n\nAssault conviction, jail, and bankruptcy\nWhile Knievel was healing from injuries sustained from the Chicago jump, the book Evel Knievel on Tour was released Written by Knievel's promoter for the Snake River Canyon jump, Shelly Saltman, the book painted him as \"an alcoholic, a pill addict, an anti-Semite and an immoral person\" through tape-recorded interviews done of Knievel and others [61]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nKnievel was married twice He and his wife Linda were married for 38 years During their marriage, the couple had four children, two boys, Kelly and Robbie, and two girls, Tracey and Alicia Throughout Kelly's and Robbie's adolescence, they performed at Knievel's stunt shows Robbie continued into adulthood to perform as a professional motorcycle daredevil After Evel's death, Kelly has overseen the Knievel legacy, including developing Knievel-related products and assisting Harley-Davidson to develop a museum exhibit [65]  Knievel's courtship and marriage to Linda was the theme of the biopic 1971 film Evel Knievel Linda and Evel separated in the early 1990s and were divorced in 1997 in San Jose, California  [citation needed]\n\n\nPost-daredevil years\nDuring the 1980s, Knievel drove around the country in a recreational vehicle, selling works of art allegedly painted by him [4] After several years of obscurity, Knievel made a significant marketing comeback in the 1990s, representing Maxim Casino, Little Caesars, Harley-Davidson and other firms.\n\n\nEvel Knievel: The Rock Opera\nIn 2003, Knievel signed over exclusive rights to Los Angeles composer Jef Bek, authorizing the production of a rock opera based on Knievel's life [73] [74] Directed by Bat Boy co-creator Keythe Farley, the production opened in Los Angeles in September 2007 to some positive reviews [75] [76]\n\n\nSix Flags Evel Knievel roller coaster\nKnievel had partnered with Six Flags St Louis to name a new wooden coaster after \"America's Legendary Daredevil\" The amusement park in Eureka, Missouri, outside of St Louis, Missouri, opened the ride on June 20, 2008 The Evel Knievel Roller Coaster operated for three seasons before being renamed American Thunder in 2011 [77]\n\n\nDeclining health\nIn the late 1990s, Knievel required a life-saving liver transplant as a result of suffering the long-term effects of Hepatitis C He contracted the disease after one of the numerous blood transfusions he received before 1992 In February 1999, Knievel was given only a few days to live and he requested to leave the hospital and die at his home En route to his home, Knievel received a phone call from the hospital stating a young man had died in a motorcycle accident and could be a donor Days later, Knievel received the transplant [4]\n\n\nChristian conversion\nOn April 1, 2007, Knievel appeared on Robert H Schuller's television program Hour of Power and announced that he \"believed in Jesus Christ\" for the first time [79] At his request, he was baptized at a televised congregation at the Crystal Cathedral by Schuller Knievel's televised testimony triggered mass baptisms at the Crystal Cathedral [80]\n\n\nDeath\nKnievel died in Clearwater, Florida, on November 30, 2007, aged 69 He had been suffering from diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years [81] A longtime friend reported that Knievel had trouble breathing while at his residence in Clearwater and died on the way to hospital The friend said, \"It's been coming for years but you just don't expect it Superman just doesn't die, right?\" [82]\n\n\nPosthumous recognition\nOn July 10, 2010, a special temporary exhibit entitled True Evel: The Amazing Story of Evel Knievel was opened at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin The exhibit was opened in collaboration with Harley-Davidson Motorcycles and Evel's oldest son, Kelly Among the various artifacts from Knievel's life, the exhibit included his \"Shark Jump\" Harley-Davidson XR-750, the Skycycle X-2, a blue jumpsuit from late in his career

Knievel**\n\nEvel Knievel, born Robert Craig Knievel on October 17, 1938, in Butte, Montana, was an American daredevil and stunt performer. He is best known for his death-defying motorcycle jumps and other high-risk stunts, which made him an international celebrity in the 1970s.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKnievel was born to Robert E. and Ann Marie Keough Knievel. His parents divorced in 1940, after the birth of their second child, Nicolas, known as Nic. Both parents decided to leave Butte. Growing up, Knievel was fascinated by the Joie Chitwood show, a daredevil motorcycle stunt performer who performed at the local fairgrounds. Knievel decided that he could do something similar using a motorcycle.\n\n**Career**\n\nAs a boy, Knievel had seen the Joie Chitwood show. He decided that he could do something similar using a motorcycle. Promoting the show himself, Knievel rented the venue, wrote the press releases, set up the show, sold the tickets, and served as his own master of ceremonies. After enticing the small crowd with a few wheelies, he proceeded to jump a 20-foot-long box of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions. Despite landing short and his back wheel hitting the box containing the rattlesnakes, Knievel managed to land safely.\n\n**Stunt Performance**\n\nAs a boy, Knievel had seen the Joie Chitwood show.

The jump was a major highlight of Knievel's career, but it ended in a crash that left him with serious injuries.\n\n**Insurance**\n\nIn a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, Knievel stated that he was uninsurable following the Caesars' crash, stating, \"I have trouble getting life insurance, accident insurance, hospitalization and even insurance for my automobile.

When he switched to the Triumph motorcycle, his jumpsuit changed to a white suit with stripes down the legs and sleeves.\n\n**Core Values**\n\nEvel Knievel took great pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life, he would repeatedly talk about the importance of \"keeping his word.\" He stated that although he knew he might not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would.\n\n**Anti-Drug Campaign**\n\nKnievel would regularly share his anti-drug message, one of his core values. Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts.\n\n**Motorcycle Helmet Safety**\n\nKnievel was a proponent of motorcycle helmet safety. He constantly encouraged his fans to wear motorcycle helmets. The Bell Star helmet he used in the Caesars Palace jump is credited for having saved Knievel's life after he fell off the motorcycle and struck his head on the ground.\n\n**Marketing Image**\n\nKnievel sought to make more money from his image. He was no longer satisfied with just receiving free motorcycles to jump with. Knievel wanted to be paid to use and promote a company's brand of motorcycles.\n\n**Ideal Toys**\n\nBetween 1972 and 1977, Ideal Toy Company released a series of Evel Knievel-related merchandise, designed initially by Joseph M Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates.

Written by Knievel's promoter for the Snake River Canyon jump, Shelly Saltman, the book painted him as \"an alcoholic, a pill addict, an anti-Semite and an immoral person\" through tape-recorded interviews done of Knievel and others.\n\n**Marriages and Children**\n\nKnievel was married twice. He and his wife Linda were married for 38 years. During their marriage, the couple had four children, two boys, Kelly and Robbie, and two girls, Tracey and Alicia. Throughout Kelly's and Robbie's adolescence, they performed at Knievel's stunt shows. Robbie continued into adulthood to perform as a professional motorcycle daredevil.\n\n**Post-Daredevil Years**\n\nDuring the 1980s, Knievel drove around the country in a recreational vehicle, selling works of art allegedly painted by him. After several years of obscurity, Knievel made a significant marketing comeback in the 1990s, representing Maxim Casino, Little Caesars, Harley-Davidson and other firms.\n\n**Evel Knievel: The Rock Opera**\n\nIn 2003, Knievel signed over exclusive rights to Los Angeles composer Jef Bek, authorizing the production of a rock opera based on Knievel's life.

The Evel Knievel Roller Coaster operated for three seasons before being renamed American Thunder in 2011.\n\n**Declining Health**\n\nIn the late 1990s, Knievel required a life-saving liver transplant as a result of suffering the long-term effects of Hepatitis C. He contracted the disease after one of the numerous blood transfusions he received before 1992. In February 1999, Knievel was given only a few days to live and he requested to leave the hospital and die at his home. En route to his home, Knievel received a phone call from the hospital stating a young man had died in a motorcycle accident and could be a donor. Days later, Knievel received the transplant.\n\n**Christian Conversion**\n\nOn April 1, 2007, Knievel appeared on Robert H Schuller's television program Hour of Power and announced that he \"believed in Jesus Christ\" for the first time. At his request, he was baptized at a televised congregation at the Crystal Cathedral by Schuller.

He had been suffering from diabetes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years. A longtime friend reported that Knievel had trouble breathing while at his residence in Clearwater and died on the way to hospital. The friend said, \"It's been coming for years but you just don't expect it Superman just doesn't die, right?\"\n\n**Posthumous Recognition**\n\nOn July 10, 2010, a special temporary exhibit entitled True Evel: The Amazing Story of Evel Knievel was opened at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Lloyd's of London has rejected me 37 times so if you hear the rumor that they insure anybody, don't pay too much attention to it.\" [22]  Four years later, a clause in Knievel's contract to jump 14 buses at Kings Island required a one-day $1 million liability insurance to the amusement park Lloyd's of London offered liability insurance for $17,500 [23] Knievel eventually paid $2,500 to a U.S.-based insurance company [23]\n\n\nJumps and records\nTo keep his name in the news, Knievel proposed his biggest stunt ever, a motorcycle jump across the Grand Canyon Just five months after his near-fatal crash in Las Vegas, Knievel performed another jump On May 25, 1968, in Scottsdale, Arizona, Knievel crashed while attempting to jump 15 Ford Mustangs Knievel ended up breaking his right leg and foot as a result of the crash.\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon jump\nAlthough Knievel never attempted to jump the Grand Canyon, rumors of the Canyon jump were started by Knievel himself in 1968, following the Caesars Palace crash During a 1968 interview, Knievel stated, \"I don't care if they say, 'Look, kid, you're going to drive that thing off the edge of the Canyon and die,' I'm going to do it I want to be the first If they'd let me go to the moon, I'd crawl all the way to Cape Kennedy just to do it I'd like to go to the moon, but I don't want to be the second man to go there.\" For the next several years, Knievel negotiated with the federal government to secure a jumping site and develop various concept bikes to make the jump, but the Interior Department denied him airspace over the northern Arizona canyon Knievel switched his attention in 1971 to the Snake River Canyon in southern Idaho.\n\n\nSnake River Canyon jump\nABC's Wide World of Sports was unwilling to pay the price Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he hired boxing promoter Bob Arum's company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed-circuit television and broadcast to movie theaters [31] Investors in the event took a substantial loss, including promoter Don E Branker, [32] as well as Vince McMahon of what was then called the World Wide Wrestling Federation [33] Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman's company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: first, the necessary financing for the jump, and second, the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America's premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps Knievel hired aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle to jump across the Snake River, and called it the Skycycle X-1 Malewicki's creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax On April 15, 1972, the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp The decision was then made to have Truax build two Skycycle X-2s, one to test and one for the actual jump Both the X-1 and the X-2 test vehicles went into the river.\n\n\nWembley jump\nAfter the Snake River jump, Knievel returned to motorcycle jumping with ABC's Wide World of Sports televising several jumps On May 26, 1975, in front of 90,000 people at Wembley Stadium in London, Knievel crashed while trying to land a jump over 13 redundant single-deck AEC Merlin buses (the term \"London Buses\" used in earlier publicity had led to the belief that the attempt was to be made over the higher and more traditional AEC Routemaster double-decker type) [citation needed]\n\n\nKings Island jump\nAfter recuperating, Knievel decided that he had spoken too soon and that he would continue jumping On October 25, 1975, Knievel jumped 14 Greyhound buses at Kings Island near Cincinnati, Ohio Although Knievel landed on the safety deck above the 14th bus, his landing was successful and he held the record for jumping the most buses on a Harley-Davidson for 24 years (until broken by Bubba Blackwell in late 1999 with 15 at 157 feet (48 m)) The Kings Island event scored the highest viewer ratings in the history of ABC's Wide World of Sports and would serve as Knievel's longest successful jump at 133 feet (41 m) (although the Caesars Palace jump was longer, it ended in a crash) In the end, Knievel was featured in seven of the ten highest-rated episodes of ABC's Wide World of Sports After the Kings Island jump, Knievel again announced his retirement.\n\n\nShark jump\nOn January 31, 1977, Knievel was scheduled for a major jump in Chicago, Illinois The jump was inspired by the 1975 film Jaws Knievel was scheduled to jump a tank full of live sharks which would be televised live nationally However, during his rehearsal, Knievel lost control of the motorcycle and crashed into a cameraman [41] Although Knievel broke his arms, he was more distraught over what he claimed was a permanent eye injury to cameraman Thomas Geren The cameraman was admitted to the hospital and received treatment for an injury near his eye, but received no permanent injury The footage of this crash was so upsetting to Knievel that he did not show the clip for 19 years until the documentary Absolute Evel: The Evel Knievel Story.\n\n\nFeature movies: Evel Knievel and Viva Knievel!\nA 1971 biopic film, Evel Knievel, fictionalized Knievel's life and exploits Knievel, portrayed by George Hamilton, calls himself \"the last gladiator in the new Rome\" in a nod to a January 1970 Esquire magazine article about the stunt rider, whose author, David Lyle, declared, \"Evel Knievel  [...] may be the last great gladiator.\" (Later, Knievel titled his 1988 self-produced documentary Last of the Gladiators.) A higher end B-movie, Evel Knievel was a minor hit, taking in $4 million in rentals [42] [43] (equivalent to approximately $30,093,673 in 2023 [44]) against a $450,000 budget [45]\n\n\nMotorcycles\nKnievel briefly used a Honda 250cc motorcycle to jump a crate of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions, his first known jump Knievel then used a Norton Motorcycle Company 750cc for only one year, 1966 Between 1967 and 1968, Knievel jumped using the Triumph Bonneville T120 (with a 650cc engine) Knievel used the Triumph at the Caesars Palace crash on New Year's Eve 1967 When Knievel returned to jumping after the crash, he used Triumph for the remainder of 1968.\n\n\nLeather jumpsuits\nThroughout his daredevil career, Knievel was known for his leather jumpsuits that were compared to the jumpsuits worn by Elvis Presley When Knievel began jumping, he used a black and yellow jumpsuit When he switched to the Triumph motorcycle, his jumpsuit changed to a white suit with stripes down the legs and sleeves In interviews, he said the reason for the switch was because he saw how Liberace had become not just a performer, but the epitome of what a showman should be, and Knievel sought to create his variation of that showmanship in his jumps [48] Two variations of the white suit appeared (one with three stars across the chest and one with the three stars on his right chest) The latter was worn at the Caesars Palace jump [49]\n\n\nCore values\nEvel Knievel took great pride in his core values Throughout his career and later life he would repeatedly talk about the importance of \"keeping his word\" [50] He stated that although he knew he might not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would Before the canyon jump, Knievel stated, \"If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word.\" [citation needed]\n\n\nAnti-drug campaign\nKnievel would regularly share his anti-drug message, one of his core values [51] Knievel would preach an anti-drug message to children and adults before each of his stunts.\n\n\nMotorcycle helmet safety\nKnievel was a proponent of motorcycle helmet safety He constantly encouraged his fans to wear motorcycle helmets The Bell Star helmet he used in the Caesars Palace jump is credited for having saved Knievel's life after he fell off the motorcycle and struck his head on the ground [49] (Following the Caesars Palace crash, each of Knievel's full-face helmets bore the slogan, \"Color Me Lucky.\") Knievel once offered a cash reward for anyone who witnessed him stunting on a motorcycle without a helmet [52]\n\n\nMarketing image\nKnievel sought to make more money from his image He was no longer satisfied with just receiving free motorcycles to jump with Knievel wanted to be paid to use and promote a company's brand of motorcycles After Triumph, the British motorcycle brand he had been jumping with, refused to meet his demands (it was part of the bankrupt BSA group that was merged with Norton in 1972), Knievel started to propose the idea to other manufacturers American Eagle Motorcycles, the brand under which Italian Laverda machines were sold in the US, was the first company to sign Knievel to an endorsement deal Knievel then used the new lightweight racing motorcycle Harley-Davidson XR-750 from December 1970 until his final jump in January 1977.\n\n\nIdeal Toys\nBetween 1972 and 1977, Ideal Toy Company released a series of Evel Knievel-related merchandise, designed initially by Joseph M Burck of Marvin Glass and Associates During the six years the toys were manufactured, Ideal claimed to have sold more than $125 million worth of Knievel toys [55] The toys included the original 1972 figures, which offered various outfits and accessories In 1973, Ideal released the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle After the release of the Stunt Cycle, the Knievel toys were the best-selling item for Ideal

In February 1992, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Wörner paid an official visit to Kyiv, and in July 1992, President Leonid Kravchuk visited NATO Headquarters in Brussels. The opening of the Ukrainian Embassy in Brussels in September 1992 was an important step in establishing formal diplomatic relations between the two sides.\n\n## Presidency of Leonid Kuchma (1994-2005)\n\nLeonid Kuchma, who became president in July 1994, signed the quadripartite Memorandum on security assurances in connection with Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 5 December 1994. This memorandum prohibited Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States from threatening or using military force or economic coercion against Ukraine, except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\n\nAs a result of other agreements and the memorandum, between 1993 and 1996, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons. This marked a significant step in Ukraine's relations with NATO, as the country was no longer considered a nuclear power. The memorandum also marked a significant improvement in Ukraine's relations with Russia, as it provided a framework for cooperation on security issues.\n\n## Presidency of Viktor Yushchenko (2005-2010)\n\nAfter the Orange Revolution in 2004, President Viktor Yushchenko, who was a strong supporter of Ukraine's NATO membership, came to power. Yushchenko's presidency marked a significant shift in Ukraine's relations with NATO, as the country began to move towards closer integration with the alliance.\n\n## Request for a NATO Membership Action Plan\n\nIn the beginning of 2008, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister, and head of parliament sent an official letter to apply for the Membership Action Plan (MAP). This marked a significant step in Ukraine's relations with NATO, as the country was seeking to join the alliance.\n\n## Bucharest Summit\n\nAt the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008, NATO decided not to offer membership to Georgia and Ukraine, despite the Ukrainian government's application for the MAP. However, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stated that Georgia and Ukraine would eventually become members.\n\n## Presidency of Viktor Yanukovych (2010-2014)\n\nDuring the 2010 presidential election campaign, Party of Regions leader and candidate Viktor Yanukovych stated that the current level of Ukraine's cooperation with NATO was sufficient and that the question of the country's accession to the alliance was not urgent. Yanukovych's victory in the election marked a turnaround in Ukraine's relations with NATO.\n\n## Presidency of Petro Poroshenko (2014-2019)\n\nYanukovych's ousting in 2014 marked a significant shift in Ukraine's relations with NATO. The country began to move closer to the alliance, and President Petro Poroshenko signed an agreement with NATO on reforms aimed at bringing Ukraine closer to membership.\n\n## Presidency of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (2019-present)\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was inaugurated in May 2019. Since then, Ukraine has continued to move closer to NATO, with the country joining the alliance's enhanced opportunity partner interoperability program in June 2020.\n\n**Russian Military Build-up around Ukraine**\n\nIn April 2021, Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis stated that his country intended to ask its NATO allies to provide Ukraine with a MAP in response to the Russian military build-up around Ukraine.\n\n**Russian Invasion of Ukraine**\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant escalation in the conflict between the two countries. The invasion has been widely condemned by the international community, with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urging Russia to reverse its military build-up.\n\n**Public Opinion in Ukraine**\n\nPublic opinion in Ukraine has traditionally been divided on the issue of NATO membership. Western Ukraine has been more pro-NATO, while eastern Ukraine has been more anti-NATO and pro-Russian.\n\n**Russian Opposition to Ukrainian NATO Membership**\n\nRussia has long been opposed to Ukraine's NATO membership, with President Vladimir Putin warning that it would be a threat to Russia. In 2008, Putin threatened to annex parts of Ukraine if it joined NATO.\n\n**Timeline of Relations**\n\n* 1990: Ukraine declares its intention to become a permanently neutral state.\n* 1991: Ukraine joins the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.\n* 1992: Ukraine joins the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n* 1994: Leonid Kuchma signs the quadripartite Memorandum on security assurances.\n* 2008: Ukraine applies for the Membership Action Plan.\n* 2014: Ukraine ousts President Viktor Yanukovych.\n* 2019: Volodymyr Zelenskyy becomes President of Ukraine.\n* 2020: Ukraine joins the NATO enhanced opportunity partner interoperability program.\n* 2022: Russia invades Ukraine.\n\n**Ukraine's Relations with NATO Member States**\n\nUkraine has developed close relations with several NATO member states, including the United States, Poland, and Romania.

composition that has revolutionized long-distance running since studies have shown that these shoes can improve marathon race time up to 4.2% [79] The composition of the sole contains a foamy material, Pebax, that Nike has altered and now calls it ZoomX (which can be found in other Nike products as well) Pebax foam can also be found in airplane insulation and is \"squishier, bouncier, and lighter\" than foams in typical running shoes [79] In the middle of the ZoomX foam there is a full-length carbon fiber plate \"designed to generate extra spring in every step\" [79] At the time of

We knew it could have only been made by this individual, and so made it our goal to officially release his records on our new label.\" [31] Several weeks later they contacted him to sign him on Paw Tracks Rather than Worn Copy, Rosenberg submitted what he believed to be his album with the least commercial potential, The Doldrums [25] The group initially rejected the album, but eventually warmed to it, and accepted it for release [2]\n\n\nPaw Tracks albums and Haunted Graffiti band\nIn the summer of 2003, Rosenberg gave a CD-R of Worn Copy to the band Animal Collective [25] after being introduced at one of their shows by a mutual friend, Beachwood Sparks drummer Jimi Hey [24] Unbeknownst to Rosenberg, Animal Collective had recently started their own record label, Paw Tracks [14] The band says in the reissued album's liner notes that it \"sat on the floor of the van for a week or so  [...] One day, we noticed it and randomly threw it on and were immediately blown away It was just like 'Woah, what is this!?

Tracks Rather than Worn Copy, Rosenberg submitted what he believed to be his album with the least commercial potential, The Doldrums [25] The group initially rejected the album, but eventually warmed to it, and accepted it for release [2]\n\n\nBefore Today, Mature Themes, and Pom Pom\nAfter securing a deal with 4AD, Rosenberg and his band recorded Before Today, his first album created in a professional studio, with a producer, and with an engineer [6] At the time, he called it the first official album of his discography and the first \"made with any kind of thought or consciousness that I have an audience.\" [23] Some of its songs were written years earlier, such as \"Beverly Kills\", which originally appeared on Scared Famous [39] Its making was fraught with personal difficulties, with some band members briefly quitting, including Rosenberg himself [23] Koh called the album \"a nightmare to record\" and said sessions \"got so bad, I quit, and Cole quit So we ended up recording most of it again at my house just to fix all the shit that producer Sunny Levine did wrong.\" [10]\n\n\nBobby Jameson and Mexican Summer remasters\nAfter Pom Pom, Pink collaborated on a variety of projects by other musicians, including Weyes Blood, Dâm-Funk, Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX, Miley Cyrus, Theophilus London, the Avalanches, Puro Instinct, Lushlife, Mild High Club, [53] Don Bolles, [54]

the moment.\" [45] The next month, he traveled to Washington D.C and attended the Donald Trump rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol Many publications, including New York Magazine, Spin, Vice, & others incorrectly reported that he was part of the group who stormed the Capitol [66]\n\n\nStyle and impact\nPink's music encompasses a diverse selection of styles, sometimes within the same song, and espouses a postmodern take on pop music [13] His initial recordings blended lo-fi psychedelic pop with elements drawn from 1980s soft rock and \"classic pop\" from California [81] He likened his early records to a compendium of what he believed to be \"everything good about music\" [30] Writing for Louder Than War, Maren McGlashan said that Pink typically draws from \"the fuzzy glow of 1970s radio, the unapologetic weirdness of Zappa, the cool enthusiasm of New Wave and Western popular culture At the center are the lo-fi aesthetics that have become the Haunted Graffiti speciality.\" [82] Pink opined that while his own music is heavily indebted to 1960s pop, it is not classifiable in any genre [83]\n\n\nApproach\nPink's music encompasses a diverse selection of styles, sometimes

referenced in early discussions of hauntology in music [86] The renewed discussion of hauntology, in itself, was prompted by his emergence [6] In an August 2009 piece for The Wire, journalist David Keenan coined \"hypnagogic pop\" to describe a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outmoded recording technology Pink was among his examples [87] Reynolds soon adopted the term and cited Pink, along with Spencer Clark and James Ferraro, as the \"godparents of hypnagogic\" [88] He also singled out Pink as the central figure in what he called the \"Altered Zones Generation\", an umbrella term for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, a sister site for Pitchfork [17]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMany of Pink's remarks in interviews have incited controversy Some of his provocations included \"It's not illegal to be racist\", \"This gay marriage stuff pisses me off\", and his expressed \"love\" for necrophiliacs, pedophiles, and the Westboro Baptist Church [13] His negative press reached a peak around the release of Pom Pom, when

Pink\n\nAriel Pink is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born on June 24, 1978, in Los Angeles, California, he is best known for his eclectic and often provocative music style, which blends elements of lo-fi psychedelic pop, soft rock, and postmodern pop.\n\n## Background\n\nAriel Marcus Rosenberg was born in Los Angeles on June 24, 1978. His father, Mario Z Rosenberg, is a Harvard-educated gastroenterologist born to a Jewish family in Mexico City, while his mother, Linda Rosenberg-Kennett, is from New Orleans. The family moved to Los Angeles after Mario completed his medical specialty work at Tulane University hospital in New Orleans. Ariel's first language was Spanish, and although his family is Jewish, with his mother having converted, he himself is not practicing. Mario and Linda divorced when Ariel was two years old.\n\n## 1996–2003: Early recordings\n\nAriel Pink's music career began at a young age. He started writing songs at around 10 years old and would often record them on his home cassette tape recorder. In an interview, Pink recalled: \"I used to write the lyrics down, but I'd have the songs arranged in my head. I didn't learn how to realize what I heard until years later. It's been a very slow process.\" During this period, Pink released several cassette tapes, including \"Scared Famous\" and \"Loofah Man\", which would later become cult classics.\n\n## 2003–2021: Label signings and touring\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Rosenberg gave a CD-R of \"Worn Copy\" to the band Animal Collective, who were introduced to him by a mutual friend, Beachwood Sparks drummer Jimi Hey. Unbeknownst to Rosenberg, Animal Collective had recently started their own record label, Paw Tracks. The band was immediately blown away by Rosenberg's music and made it their goal to officially release his records on their label. Several weeks later, they contacted him to sign him on Paw Tracks. Rather than \"Worn Copy\", Rosenberg submitted what he believed to be his album with the least commercial potential, \"The Doldrums\". The group initially rejected the album, but eventually warmed to it, and accepted it for release.\n\n## Before Today, Mature Themes, and Pom Pom\n\nAfter securing a deal with 4AD, Rosenberg and his band recorded \"Before Today\", his first album created in a professional studio, with a producer, and with an engineer. At the time, he called it the first official album of his discography and the first \"made with any kind of thought or consciousness that I have an audience.\" Some of its songs were written years earlier, such as \"Beverly Kills\", which originally appeared on \"Scared Famous\". The making of \"Before Today\" was fraught with personal difficulties, with some band members briefly quitting, including Rosenberg himself.\n\n## Bobby Jameson and Mexican Summer remasters\n\nAfter the release of \"Pom Pom\", Pink collaborated on a variety of projects by other musicians, including Weyes Blood, Dâm-Funk, Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX, Miley Cyrus, Theophilus London, the Avalanches, Puro Instinct, Lushlife, Mild High Club, Don Bolles, Water Tower, and MGMT. Pink and Weyes Blood jointly recorded the EP \"Myths 002\", which was released in January 2017 on the Brooklyn-based label Mexican Summer.\n\n## 2021–present: Ariel Pink's Dark Side\n\nIn a December 2020 interview, Pink intimated that he may never release another album due to contemporary social and political affairs, and wrote that he was \"not thinking about making art at the moment.\" The next month, he traveled to Washington D.C and attended the Donald Trump rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol. Many publications, including New York Magazine, Spin, Vice, and others, incorrectly reported that he was part of the group who stormed the Capitol.\n\n## Style and impact\n\nAriel Pink's music encompasses a diverse selection of styles, sometimes within the same song, and espouses a postmodern take on pop music. His initial recordings blended lo-fi psychedelic pop with elements drawn from 1980s soft rock and \"classic pop\" from California. He likened his early records to a compendium of what he believed to be \"everything good about music.\" Writing for Louder Than War, Maren McGlashan said that Pink typically draws from \"the fuzzy glow of 1970s radio, the unapologetic weirdness of Zappa, the cool enthusiasm of New Wave and Western popular culture. At the center are the lo-fi aesthetics that have become the Haunted Graffiti specialty.\"\n\n## Hauntology and lo-fi revival\n\nDuring the late 2000s, Pink was referenced in early discussions of hauntology in music. The renewed discussion of hauntology, in itself, was prompted by his emergence. In an August 2009 piece for The Wire, journalist David Keenan coined \"hypnagogic pop\" to describe a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia, childhood memory, and outmoded recording technology. Pink was among his examples.\n\n## Personal life\n\nMany of Pink's remarks in interviews have incited controversy. Some of his provocations included \"It's not illegal to be racist\", \"This gay marriage stuff pisses me off\", and his expressed \"love\" for necrophiliacs, pedophiles, and the Westboro Baptist Church. His negative press reached a peak around the release of \"Pom Pom\", when detractors variously labelled him a \"troll\", a \"beta male\", and a \"misogynist\". Fans argued that he is simply a glib speaker.\n\n## Relationships and family\n\nDuring his early 20s, Rosenberg was married to a woman named Alisa. They divorced around 2004. From 2006 to 2012, he was in a relationship with the artist Geneva Jacuzzi. Pink was also involved in a relationship with singer-songwriter Soko.\n\n## Beliefs\n\n\"I'm not really skilled at doing anything other than yapping and politicking. [...] No one really wants to hear a musician talk about stuff like that though so I have no business in bringing it up.\"\n\n## Influences\n\nPink's stated musical influences include The Velvet Underground, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, and David Bowie.\n\n## Selected discography\n\n* Studio albums:\n\t+ \"Scared Famous\" (1996)\n\t+ \"Loofah Man\" (1997)\n\t+ \"The Doldrums\" (2004)\n\t+ \"Before Today\" (2010)\n\t+ \"Mature Themes\" (2012)\n\t+ \"Pom Pom\" (2014)\n\t+ \"Myths 002\" (2017)\n\n## Explanatory notes\n\nAriel Pink's music career spans over two decades, with a diverse and eclectic discography that blends elements of lo-fi psychedelic pop, soft rock, and postmodern pop. His early recordings were released on cassette tape, while his later work was released on CD and vinyl. Pink has collaborated with various musicians and artists, including Weyes Blood, Dâm-Funk, and The Avalanches.\n\n## References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ariel_Pink\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nAriel Marcus Rosenberg was born in Los Angeles on June 24, 1978 [9] He is the only son of Mario Z Rosenberg and Linda Rosenberg-Kennett [3] [10] Mario is a Harvard-educated gastroenterologist born to a Jewish family in Mexico City, while Linda is from New Orleans They moved to Los Angeles after Mario completed his medical specialty work at Tulane University hospital in New Orleans [10] [nb 1] Ariel's first language was Spanish [3] Although his family is Jewish, with his mother having converted, [11] he himself is not practicing [12] Mario and Linda divorced when Ariel was two years old [13]\n\n\n1996–2003: Early recordings\n [I started writing songs at around] age 10 I used to write the lyrics down, but I'd have the songs arranged in my head I didn't learn how to realize what I heard until years later It's been a very slow process.\n\n\n2003–2021: Label signings and touring\nIn the summer of 2003, Rosenberg gave a CD-R of Worn Copy to the band Animal Collective [25] after being introduced at one of their shows by a mutual friend, Beachwood Sparks drummer Jimi Hey [24] Unbeknownst to Rosenberg, Animal Collective had recently started their own record label, Paw Tracks [14] The band says in the reissued album's liner notes that it \"sat on the floor of the van for a week or so  [...] One day, we noticed it and randomly threw it on and were immediately blown away It was just like 'Woah, what is this!?

Jaume Collet-Serra and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. The film is a live-action adaptation of the theme park attraction of the same name and is the seventh installment in the Disney theme park attraction-based film series. The film stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt as the main characters, along with Edgar Ramírez, Jack Whitehall, Jesse Plemons, Andy Serkis, and Veronica Falcón in supporting roles.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Jungle Cruise film is a thrilling adventure that follows the story of a riverboat captain and his crew as they navigate through the treacherous waters of the Amazon River. The film is a mix of action, romance, and humor, with a dash of fantasy and adventure. The movie is set in the early 20th century and follows the story of Dr. Lily Houghton, a determined and fearless explorer, and her brother MacGregor, who are on a quest to find the legendary Tree of Life. Along the way, they meet Frank Wolff, a charismatic and cunning riverboat captain, who becomes their ally in their quest.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film begins in 1556, where Don Aguirre leads a group of Spanish conquistadors to South America in search of the Lágrimas de Cristal Tree, whose flowers have the power to heal illnesses, injuries, and lift curses. However, after many conquistadors die, the Puka Michuna tribe heals the survivors with the Tree's flowers. The tribal chief refuses to reveal the Tree's location, so Aguirre stabs him and burns the village. The dying chief curses the conquistadors, making them immortal and unable to leave sight of the Amazon River without being dragged back by the jungle itself.\n\nThe story then shifts to 1916, where the Puka Michuna tribe has a centuries-long history of guarding the Tree.

{"title": "Maximiliano_Hernández_Martínez", "content": "\nEarly life\nMaximiliano Hernández Martínez was born on 21 October 1882 in San Matías, El Salvador His parents were Raymundo Hernández and Petronila Martínez Martínez [a] earned his bachelor's degree in San Salvador, El Salvador's capital city, after which he enrolled in the Polytechnic School of Guatemala  [es], a military academy where he earned the rank of sub-lieutenant He returned to El Salvador and attended the Jurisprudence and Social Sciences Faculty at the University of El Salvador; however, he abandoned his studies in favor of pursuing a military career [4]\n\n\n1931 election and vice presidency\nEl Salvador had a presidential election in 1931 Every election prior to that date had been held with a pre-designated winner; however, President Pío Romero Bosque decided in spring 1930 to hold free and fair elections for 1931 This led to numerous candidates registering presidential campaigns [9] Bosque did not endorse any specific candidate [10] Martínez was among those candidates, resigning his position as second inspector general of the army on 28 May 1930 in order to run for president Martínez attempted to rally popular support by taking socialist political positions [11] His campaign was supported by the National Republican Party, a minor political party [12]\n\n\nRise to power\nIn late 1931, Araujo attempted to reduce the military's budget in order to improve the government's financial situation, but the army's officers refused to comply with Araujo's proposed budget cut [21] Araujo's government had failed to pay the military's officers and enlisted men for several months, and on 1 December 1931, Araujo removed Martínez as minister of war, after questioning his loyalty, and replaced him with Salvador López Rochac, Araujo's brother-in-law [20] On 2 December, due to the government's failure to pay the military's wages [22] and Martínez's removal, [20] a group of junior officers overthrew Araujo, forced him to flee the country to Guatemala, [22] and arrested many of the army's senior officers [21]\n\n\n1931 coup and appointment as president\nIn late 1931, Araujo attempted to reduce the military's budget in order to improve the government's financial situation, but the army's officers refused to comply with Araujo's proposed budget cut [21] Araujo's government had failed to pay the

flee the country to Guatemala, [22] and arrested many of the army's senior officers [21]\n\n\nInternational recognition\nThe Legislative Assembly confirmed Martínez as president of El Salvador in 1932 [32] and designated him to serve the remainder of Araujo's term, that would end in 1935 [33] On 8 June 1932, Martínez confirmed that he would stay in office until 1935, after reportedly receiving 2,600 petitions containing thousands of signatures that requested that he do so in April 1932 [34] Although Martínez's government was recognized by the Legislative Assembly, his government did not receive recognition from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, or the United States due to the terms of the 1923 Central American Treaty of Peace and Amity [35] [36] Article 2 of the treaty stipulated that all its signatories [c] would not recognize governments that assumed power through undemocratic means, such as a coup d'état [37] [38]\n\n\nPresidency\nAraujo's government had scheduled municipal and legislative elections for 15 December 1931 After his overthrow, the military postponed the municipal elections to be held from 3 to 5 January and the legislative elections to be held from 10 to 12 January 1932 They promised that the elections would be free and fair, and allowed all political parties to participate, including the Communist Party [46] When the municipal elections took place, municipalities where the Communist Party won had their results suspended by the government [47] In the subsequent legislative election the following week, after early results indicated a Communist Party victory in the department of San Salvador, the official results published on 21 January announced that three non-communists had won the department's three legislative seats [48] Violence between the National Guard, communists, and civilians persisted throughout both the municipal and legislative election processes [49] The government ultimately canceled the results of both elections [50]\n\n\nLa Matanza\nAraujo's government had scheduled municipal and legislative elections for 15 December 1931 After his overthrow, the military postponed the municipal elections to

that three non-communists had won the department's three legislative seats [48] Violence between the National Guard, communists, and civilians persisted throughout both the municipal and legislative election processes [49] The government ultimately canceled the results of both elections [50]\n\n\nEconomic policies\nUpon assuming office, Martínez's government assumed control over the country's economy in an attempt to mitigate the situation, that ultimately resulted in Araujo's overthrow In January 1932, Martínez appointed Miguel Tomás Molina as his minister of finance in an effort to establish confidence in the country's financial stability and integrity Martínez's government then proceeded to make large budget reductions in anticipation of reduced government revenue The government also reduced interest rates by 40 percent, granted extensions to individuals who were unable to repay their loans, [87] and cut the wages of civil servants — with the exception of military personnel — by 30 percent [88]\n\n\nElections and constitutional changes\nIn June 1933, Martínez announced his intention to be elected as president of El Salvador in the upcoming 1935 presidential election He established the National Pro Patria Party (officially the \"National Party of the Fatherland\") to promote his presidential campaign [104] He had the previous year, in February 1932, established a network of informants known as the National Pro Patria Legion within the military, police, and intelligence agencies, [105] with the informants themselves known as orejas (Spanish for \"ears\") [106] The informants spied on and monitored individuals for potential political dissidence, including members of his own government [107] In 1937, the National Pro Patria Legion was renamed the Civic Guards [105] In 1941, Martínez later promoted the formation of militias within the National Pro Patria Party [108] The National Pro Patria Party was the only legal political party in El Salvador, and all politicians in elected or appointed offices had to be members of the party [109] [110]\n\n\nSocial policies\nIn 1932, Martínez revoked the autonomy previously granted to the University of El Salvador, putting it under direct government control His action led to students and professors protesting against the decision, and in 1934, the government restored the university's autonomy [122] Martínez revoked the university's autonomy again in 1938, resulting in students going on strike and refusing to attend classes [117] These protests were suppressed by 1939 without major resistance, and students eventually returned to the university [118]\n\n\nIdeology and foreign affairs\nIn May 1937, Frank P Corrigan, the United States ambassador to El Salvador, wrote a letter to Hull stating that Martínez had \"gained the approval of the greater part of the people\", allowed for \"free expression of opinion if he considers it well intentioned and not subversive\", and believed that Martínez had not become a dictator in an \"opprobrious sense\" [125] His opinion of Martínez changed after he began openly praising the works of totalitarian governments in Europe and told Hull to work to discourage the \"beginning of a Dictatorship\" in El Salvador [126] In mid-1938, Fay Allen Des Portes, the United States ambassador to Guatemala, told Hull that he had received reports that Martínez had \"turned Fascist in the letter and the spirit\" [116] After Manuel Castaneda left Martínez's government in 1939, he accused Martínez of being the most \"anti-democratic\" leader in the Americas and that he had shifted the economy in favor of \"Nazi-Fascist Imperialism\" [99]\n\n\nWorld War II\nDespite Martínez's personal sympathies with fascism, he continued to reiterate his commitment to democracy, his opposition to totalitarianism, and his support for the United States [141] Beginning in 1940, he began to crackdown on Nazi activity in El Salvador [142] and even suppressed a fascist demonstration based on the Italian Blackshirts on 10 June 1940, the day that Italy joined World War II on the side of the Axis powers [143] Although Martínez and many of his government officials supported fascist ideals, the majority of the Salvadoran population did not [144] In September 1939, both Hundelhausen and Bohnstedt resigned from their positions due to open public opposition to their appointments [145]\n\n\nFall from power\nFrom 1935 to 1939, five coup attempts were devised to overthrow Martínez Three were discovered before they could be executed, and the other two were crushed during the attempt [106] In August 1943, some opposition politicians, military officers, and anti-fascist activists began plotting to overthrow Martínez, but several of the plotters were arrested in late 1943 Shortly afterwards, Ernesto Interiano was killed by the police during an attempted assassination of Martínez in a lone wolf attack [101]\n\n\nPalm Sunday Coup\nOn Palm Sunday, 2 April 1944, the 1st and 5th Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Artillery Regiment launched an attempted coup against Martínez's government The coup was led by some military officers and politicians who had plotted the foiled 1943 coup attempt [152] The rebel military factions occupied strategic locations in San Salvador and in other major cities and took control of the air force and the YSP radio station [153] The National Police, the National Guard, and the remainder of the armed forces remained loyal to Martínez The coup eventually failed due to a lack of leadership [152] and the rebels' failure to capture Martínez [153]\n\n\nStrike of Fallen Arms\nThe various military officers and politicians that were executed following the attempted Palm Sunday Coup soon became seen as martyrs by students and other opponents of Martínez [154] On 28 April 1944, students at the University of El Salvador and doctors from hospitals in San Salvador declared that they would go on strike to protest against the executions until Martínez's government resigned [155] [156] They were later joined by postgraduate, high school, and primary school students [155] In the ensuing protests, soldiers killed over 100 students, leading to workers, bankers, business owners, and professors joining their protest and declaring a general strike to cripple the country's economy [156] [154]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 11 May 1944, two days after issuing his resignation, Martínez and his family fled to Guatemala [155] [156] with the assistance of Martínez's brother, Guadeloupe Afterwards, Martínez and his family moved to Honduras [160] He returned from exile in 9 July 1955, meeting President Óscar Osorio when his plane landed in San Salvador, but was greeted by protests [161] When the Legislative Assembly opened discussions on 23 July concerning whether to charge him with crimes committed during his time in office, he fled the country [162] On 15 May 1966, Martínez was stabbed seventeen times by his taxi driver, Cipriano Morales, in his kitchen in Hacienda Jamastrán, Honduras [160] Morales killed Martínez over a labor dispute, [158] although police initially suspected that robbery had been the primary motive [163]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMartínez married Araujo's former mistress, Concepción Monteagudo, as one of the conditions he agreed to with Araujo to become his vice president [1] The couple had eight children: Alberto, Carmen, Esperanza, Marina, Eduardo, Rosa, Gloria, and Maximiliano Martínez's uncle, Guadalupe Martínez, had helped him enroll in college [4]\n\n\nFamily\nMartínez married Araujo's former mistress, Concepción Monteagudo, as one of the conditions he agreed to with Araujo to become his vice president [1] The couple had eight children: Alberto, Carmen, Esperanza, Marina, Eduardo, Rosa, Gloria, and Maximiliano Martínez's uncle, Guadalupe Martínez, had helped him enroll in college [4]\n\n\nReligious and personal beliefs\nMartínez was a theosophist and a freemason [79] [164] [165] He believed in spiritualism [32] [44] and the occult, [44] [166] and he regularly performed séances at his home [19] In April 1944, when Luis Chávez y González, the archbishop of San Salvador, asked Martínez to stop the executions of revolutionaries \"in the name of God\", Martínez responded by telling Chávez, \"I am God in El Salvador\" [167] Martínez converted to Catholicism in his later life at the insistence of his wife [168]\n\n\nLegacy\nMartínez was the longest-serving president in Salvadoran history, [32] staying in office for over 12 years [113] His presidency is sometimes referred to as the Martinato [173] Martínez was the first of a series of military dictators who held power in El Salvador until the 1979 coup d'état [174] [175] [120]\n\n\nAwards and decorations\nDuring his presidency, Martínez was given the title \"Benefactor of the Fatherland\" (\"Benefactor de la Patria\") [4] Instead of styling himself as \"Mr President\" (\"señor Presidente\"), he styled himself as \"Master and Leader\" (\"Maestro y Líder\") [186] Martínez was awarded the grand cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy in 1934 [187] followed by the cross of the Order of Boyacá from Colombia in 1936 [188] He was also awarded the grand cross of the Order of the Quetzal by Guatemala in 1937, [189] [190] the Order of the Illustrious Dragon by the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in China in September 1938, [4] [191] the grand cross of the Imperial Order from Japan in October 1938, [192] and the Pan-American Order of Pétion and

He was a key figure in Salvadoran politics during the mid-20th century and played a significant role in shaping the country's history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMaximiliano Hernández Martínez was born on 21 October 1882 in San Matías, El Salvador. His parents were Raymundo Hernández and Petronila Martínez Martínez. Martínez earned his bachelor's degree in San Salvador, El Salvador's capital city, after which he enrolled in the Polytechnic School of Guatemala, a military academy where he earned the rank of sub-lieutenant. He returned to El Salvador and attended the Jurisprudence and Social Sciences Faculty at the University of El Salvador; however, he abandoned his studies in favor of pursuing a military career.\n\n**1931 Election and Vice Presidency**\n\nEl Salvador had a presidential election in 1931. Every election prior to that date had been held with a pre-designated winner; however, President Pío Romero Bosque decided in spring 1930 to hold free and fair elections for 1931. This led to numerous candidates registering presidential campaigns. Martínez was among those candidates, resigning his position as second inspector general of the army on 28 May 1930 in order to run for president. Martínez attempted to rally popular support by taking socialist political positions. His campaign was supported by the National Republican Party, a minor political party.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nIn late 1931, Araujo attempted to reduce the military's budget in order to improve the government's financial situation, but the army's officers refused to comply with Araujo's proposed budget cut. Araujo's government had failed to pay the military's officers and enlisted men for several months, and on 1 December 1931, Araujo removed Martínez as minister of war, after questioning his loyalty, and replaced him with Salvador López Rochac, Araujo's brother-in-law. On 2 December, due to the government's failure to pay the military's wages and Martínez's removal, a group of junior officers overthrew Araujo, forced him to flee the country to Guatemala, and arrested many of the army's senior officers.\n\n**1931 Coup and Appointment as President**\n\nIn late 1931, Araujo attempted to reduce the military's budget in order to improve the government's financial situation, but the army's officers refused to comply with Araujo's proposed budget cut. Araujo's government had failed to pay the military's officers and enlisted men for several months, and on 1 December 1931, Araujo removed Martínez as minister of war, after questioning his loyalty, and replaced him with Salvador López Rochac, Araujo's brother-in-law. On 2 December, due to the government's failure to pay the military's wages and Martínez's removal, a group of junior officers overthrew Araujo, forced him to flee the country to Guatemala, and arrested many of the army's senior officers.\n\n**International Recognition**\n\nThe Legislative Assembly confirmed Martínez as president of El Salvador in 1932 and designated him to serve the remainder of Araujo's term, that would end in 1935. On 8 June 1932, Martínez confirmed that he would stay in office until 1935, after reportedly receiving 2,600 petitions containing thousands of signatures that requested that he do so in April 1932. Although Martínez's government was recognized by the Legislative Assembly, his government did not receive recognition from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, or the United States due to the terms of the 1923 Central American Treaty of Peace and Amity.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nAraujo's government had scheduled municipal and legislative elections for 15 December 1931. After his overthrow, the military postponed the municipal elections to be held from 3 to 5 January and the legislative elections to be held from 10 to 12 January 1932. They promised that the elections would be free and fair, and allowed all political parties to participate, including the Communist Party. When the municipal elections took place, municipalities where the Communist Party won had their results suspended by the government. In the subsequent legislative election the following week, after early results indicated a Communist Party victory in the department of San Salvador, the official results published on 21 January announced that three non-communists had won the department's three legislative seats. Violence between the National Guard, communists, and civilians persisted throughout both the municipal and legislative election processes. The government ultimately canceled the results of both elections.\n\n**Economic Policies**\n\nUpon assuming office, Martínez's government assumed control over the country's economy in an attempt to mitigate the situation, that ultimately resulted in Araujo's overthrow. In January 1932, Martínez appointed Miguel Tomás Molina as his minister of finance in an effort to establish confidence in the country's financial stability and integrity. Martínez's government then proceeded to make large budget reductions in anticipation of reduced government revenue. The government also reduced interest rates by 40 percent, granted extensions to individuals who were unable to repay their loans, and cut the wages of civil servants — with the exception of military personnel — by 30 percent.\n\n**Elections and Constitutional Changes**\n\nIn June 1933, Martínez announced his intention to be elected as president of El Salvador in the upcoming 1935 presidential election. He established the National Pro Patria Party (officially the \"National Party of the Fatherland\") to promote his presidential campaign. He had the previous year, in February 1932, established a network of informants known as the National Pro Patria Legion within the military, police, and intelligence agencies, with the informants themselves known as orejas (Spanish for \"ears\"). The informants spied on and monitored individuals for potential political dissidence, including members of his own government. In 1937, the National Pro Patria Legion was renamed the Civic Guards. In 1941, Martínez later promoted the formation of militias within the National Pro Patria Party. The National Pro Patria Party was the only legal political party in El Salvador, and all politicians in elected or appointed offices had to be members of the party.\n\n**Social Policies**\n\nIn 1932, Martínez revoked the autonomy previously granted to the University of El Salvador, putting it under direct government control. His action led to students and professors protesting against the decision, and in 1934, the government restored the university's autonomy. Martínez revoked the university's autonomy again in 1938, resulting in students going on strike and refusing to attend classes. These protests were suppressed by 1939 without major resistance, and students eventually returned to the university.\n\n**Ideology and Foreign Affairs**\n\nIn May 1937, Frank P Corrigan, the United States ambassador to El Salvador, wrote a letter to Hull stating that Martínez had \"gained the approval of the greater part of the people\", allowed for \"free expression of opinion if he considers it well intentioned and not subversive\", and believed that Martínez had not become a dictator in an \"opprobrious sense\". His opinion of Martínez changed after he began openly praising the works of totalitarian governments in Europe and told Hull to work to discourage the \"beginning of a Dictatorship\" in El Salvador. In mid-1938, Fay Allen Des Portes, the United States ambassador to Guatemala, told Hull that he had received reports that Martínez had \"turned Fascist in the letter and the spirit\".\n\n**World War II**\n\nDespite Martínez's personal sympathies with fascism, he continued to reiterate his commitment to democracy, his opposition to totalitarianism, and his support for the United States. Beginning in 1940, he began to crackdown on Nazi activity in El Salvador and even suppressed a fascist demonstration based on the Italian Blackshirts on 10 June 1940, the day that Italy joined World War II on the side of the Axis powers. Although Martínez and many of his government officials supported fascist ideals, the majority of the Salvadoran population did not. In September 1939, both Hundelhausen and Bohnstedt resigned from their positions due to open public opposition to their appointments.\n\n**Fall from Power**\n\nFrom 1935 to 1939, five coup attempts were devised to overthrow Martínez. Three were discovered before they could be executed, and the other two were crushed during the attempt. In August 1943, some opposition politicians, military officers, and anti-fascist activists began plotting to overthrow Martínez, but several of the plotters were arrested in late 1943. Shortly afterwards, Ernesto Interiano was killed by the police during an attempted assassination of Martínez in a lone wolf attack.\n\n**Palm Sunday Coup**\n\nOn Palm Sunday, 2 April 1944, the 1st and 5th Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Artillery Regiment launched an attempted coup against Martínez's government. The coup was led by some military officers and politicians who had plotted the foiled 1943 coup attempt. The rebel military factions occupied strategic locations in San Salvador and in other major cities and took control of the air force and the YSP radio station. The National Police, the National Guard, and the remainder of the armed forces remained loyal to Martínez.

professors joining their protest and declaring a general strike to cripple the country's economy [156] [154]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 11 May 1944, two days after issuing his resignation, Martínez and his family fled to Guatemala [155] [156] with the assistance of Martínez's brother, Guadeloupe Afterwards, Martínez and his family moved to Honduras [160] He returned from exile in 9 July 1955, meeting President Óscar Osorio when his plane landed in San Salvador, but was greeted by protests [161] When the Legislative Assembly opened discussions on 23 July concerning whether to charge him with crimes committed during his time in office, he fled the country [162] On 15 May 1966, Martínez was stabbed seventeen times by his taxi driver, Cipriano Morales, in his kitchen in Hacienda Jamastrán, Honduras [160] Morales killed Martínez over a labor dispute, [158] although police initially suspected that robbery had been the primary motive [163]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMartínez married Araujo's former mistress, Concepción Monteagudo, as one of the conditions he agreed to with Araujo to become his vice president [1] The couple had eight children: Alberto, Carmen, Esperanza, Marina, Eduardo, Rosa, Gloria, and

helped him enroll in college [4]\n\n\nReligious and personal beliefs\nMartínez was a theosophist and a freemason [79] [164] [165] He believed in spiritualism [32] [44] and the occult, [44] [166] and he regularly performed séances at his home [19] In April 1944, when Luis Chávez y González, the archbishop of San Salvador, asked Martínez to stop the executions of revolutionaries \"in the name of God\", Martínez responded by telling Chávez, \"I am God in El Salvador\" [167] Martínez converted to Catholicism in his later life at the insistence of his wife [168]\n\n\nLegacy\nMartínez was the longest-serving president in Salvadoran history, [32] staying in office for over 12 years [113] His presidency is sometimes referred to as the Martinato [173] Martínez was the first of a series of military dictators who held power in El Salvador until the 1979 coup d'état [174] [175] [120]\n\n\nAwards and decorations\nDuring his presidency, Martínez was given the title \"Benefactor of the Fatherland\" (\"Benefactor de la Patria\") [4] Instead of styling himself as \"Mr President\" (\"señor Presidente\"), he styled himself as \"Master and Leader\" (\"Maestro y Líder\") [186] Martínez was awarded the grand cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy in 1934 [187] followed by the cross of the Order of Boyacá from Colombia in 1936 [188] He was also awarded the grand cross of the Order

was interested in Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine [85] The film had an estimated budget of $250–300 million, coming down to about $230 million after tax credits [3] Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated that he intended to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format [88] The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes) [89] [90] Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-president David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues [90]\n\n\nDesign\nCostume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\" [8] [122] [123] Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face [8] Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which took two years to complete Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary [8] The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling [124]\n\n\nCostume design\nCostume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps

fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty It's sort of a practical military aesthetic This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers The Dark Knight Rises is a war film.\" Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\" [125]\n\n\nMusic\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer Hans Zimmer confirmed that he would be returning to score The Dark Knight Rises James Newton Howard was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of Inception would make him seem like a \"third wheel\" [128] Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores but explained that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme [8]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote The Dark Knight The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\" Warner Bros removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag The website revealed the first official image of Bane [136]\n\n\nRelease\nOn July 6, 2012, Warner Bros held a special IMAX screening of The Dark Knight Rises for more than one hundred reporters and critics However, technical issues with the computer device synchronizing the sound and picture forced the studio to postpone the screening by a day [178] The film later premiered on July 16 at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City, [179] followed by a European premiere on July 18 at Leicester Square in London, England [180] The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, [181] and was later released in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20 [182] [183]\n\n\nColorado shooting\n\"I would not presume to know anything

superhero thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer. The film is the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, with Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, and Gary Oldman in supporting roles.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, in which the Joker's chaotic reign of terror had pushed Gotham City to the brink of collapse. Batman has since disappeared, and the city has been rebuilt under the watchful eye of the police department, led by Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman). However, a new threat emerges in the form of Bane (Tom Hardy), a masked terrorist who seeks to destroy Gotham and its people.\n\nBane, a former member of the League of Shadows, leads an attack on a CIA plane over Uzbekistan to abduct nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel and fake Pavel's death in the crash. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, still mourning the death of Rachel Dawes. Wayne Enterprises has stagnated, and the company is on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nAs Bane's plans unfold, Batman emerges from his self-imposed exile, determined to stop the terrorist and save the city. Along the way, he must confront his own demons and face off against Bane in an epic battle of wits and strength.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a star-studded cast, including:\n\n* Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman\n* Tom Hardy as Bane\n* Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle/Catwoman\n* Gary Oldman as Commissioner James Gordon\n* Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox\n* Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul\n* Juno Temple as Holly Robinson\n* Tom Conti as Mayor Anthony Garcia\n* Burn Gorman as Dr. Pavel\n* Rob Brown, Will Estes, and Desmond Harrington as police officers\n* Christopher Judge as one of Bane's henchmen\n* Noel Gugliemi as an ex-prisoner who is in charge of exiling corrupt elites during Bane's revolution\n* Thomas Lennon as a doctor\n* Glen Powell as a stock exchange trader\n\n**Production**\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises was filmed in various locations, including India, Romania, and Michigan. The film had an estimated budget of $250-300 million, which came down to about $230 million after tax credits. Christopher Nolan elected not to film in 3D, instead focusing on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format.\n\nThe film features over an hour of footage shot in IMAX, making it one of the longest IMAX sequences in a film to date. Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-president David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe costume design for the film was created by Lindy Hemming, who explained that Bane's costume was designed to look like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together. The mask was designed to look animalistic, and the costume effects supervisor created a three-dimensional model of Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask.\n\nThe coat worn by Bane was designed by Hemming and took two years to complete. It was inspired by a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, and was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music for the film was composed by Hans Zimmer, who confirmed in an interview that he would be returning to score The Dark Knight Rises. Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores but explained that he wanted to go in a completely different direction for Bane's theme.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe official website for the film launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote The Dark Knight. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting, and users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag, and the website revealed the first official image of Bane.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released in IMAX on July 6, 2012, at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City, followed by a European premiere on July 18 at Leicester Square in London, England. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, and was later released in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20.\n\n**Colorado Shooting**\n\nIn the wake of the mass shooting during a midnight screening of the film in Aurora, Colorado, Warner Bros delayed the release of box office figures for the movie until Monday, July 23, 2012. The shooting resulted in the deaths of 12 people and injured 59 others.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nThe film opened on Friday, July 20, 2012, and earned an estimated $30.6 million in midnight showings. It set an IMAX midnight-gross record with $2.3 million and made $75.8 million during its opening day. On July 23, 2012, it was announced that the film grossed $160.9 million for its debut weekend, which was the third-highest opening weekend ever at the time.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, with an approval rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes and a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic. The film was praised for its ambition, thoughtfulness, and action sequences. The cast, particularly Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway, received widespread critical acclaim.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe film has been analyzed as a reflection of the conservative agenda, with some critics accusing it of perpetuating a Tea Party-like message. The film's portrayal of the Occupy Wall Street movement has been criticized by some, with some accusing it of being anti-Occupy propaganda.\n\n**Internet Meme**\n\nThe film's CIA operative, Bill Wilson, played by Aidan Gillen, became the subject of an internet meme popular among 4chan users known as \"Baneposting\", which references the dialogue between Wilson and Bane in the film's opening plane scene.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film received numerous accolades, including a nomination for Special Visual Effects at the British Academy Film Awards, four nominations at the Critics' Choice Awards, two Satellite Awards, five Saturn Awards (winning one), and a Grammy Award.

[86] [87] According to the Romania Insider, Nolan was interested in Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine [85] The film had an estimated budget of $250–300 million, coming down to about $230 million after tax credits [3] Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated that he intended to focus on improving image quality

IMAX Vice-president David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues [90]\n\n\nDesign\nCostume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\" [8] [122] [123] Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face [8] Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which took two years to complete Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary [8] The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling [124]\n\n\nCostume design\nCostume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an

when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty It's sort of a practical military aesthetic This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers The Dark Knight Rises is a war film.\" Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\" [125]\n\n\nMusic\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer Hans Zimmer confirmed that he would be returning to score The Dark Knight Rises James Newton Howard was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of Inception would make him seem like a \"third wheel\" [128] Zimmer

{"title": "Sony's_Spider-Man_Universe", "content": "\nName\nSony officially announced their new shared universe—based on various Marvel Comics properties and characters commonly associated with Spider-Man—in May 2017, with the title \"Sony's Marvel Universe\" [1] By August 2018, it was being referred to as \"Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters\" internally at the company [2] In March 2019, a Sony Pictures Entertainment presentation referred to the \"Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters\" (SPUMC), [3] and Sony later confirmed that this was the official name for its shared universe [4] The presentation applied the title to Marvel Studios' Spider-Man films and the animated Spider-Verse films as well as Sony's own live-action Marvel adaptations [3] [4] The title was widely criticized, with commentators mocking its length compared to shorter franchise names like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and DC Extended Universe (DCEU), [5] [6] [7] as well as the acronym \"SPUMC\" [5] [6] James Whitbrook of io9 questioned why the term \"Spider-Verse\" was not being used [5] Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch stated that Sony did not want to refer to their shared universe as the \"Spider-Verse\" since it encompassed many characters separate from Spider-Man [8] Despite this, Sony announced in August 2021 that the franchise had been renamed \"Sony's Spider-Man Universe\" (SSU) [9]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn January 2010, Sony announced that the Spider-Man film franchise would be rebooted after director Sam Raimi decided to no longer continue his version of the franchise [10] By March 2012, Sony was still interested in a spin-off film they had been developing centered on the character Venom, looking to capitalize on the release of the first reboot film, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) [11] That June, producers Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach discussed Venom and The Amazing Spider-Man in reference to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and how the different franchises set in that world crossed over with The Avengers (2012) Tolmach stated, \"Hopefully all these worlds will live together in peace someday.\" [12] In December 2013, Sony revealed plans to use The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) to establish their own expanded universe based on the Marvel properties the studio had the film rights to, including Venom Arad and Tolmach would produce the films as part of a franchise brain trust that also included Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner, Ed Solomon, and Drew Goddard, and The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director Marc Webb [13] However, after The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed and with Sony \"under tremendous pressure to perform\", the direction of the new shared universe was rethought [14]\n\n\nBackground\nIn January 2010, Sony announced that the Spider-Man film franchise would be rebooted after director Sam Raimi decided to no longer continue his version of the franchise [10] By

Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed and with Sony \"under tremendous pressure to perform\", the direction of the new shared universe was rethought [14]\n\n\nSony's shared universe\nVenom was revived by Sony in March 2016, envisioned as a standalone film unrelated from Sony and Marvel's new Spider-Man films, which would launch its own franchise and shared universe [26] [27] In May 2017, Sony confirmed that Venom was not considered a spin-off of any other film, and would officially begin its own shared universe [1] Sony was looking to build out this new universe gradually rather than rush in as they had previously tried with the Amazing Spider-Man spin-offs [28] In July, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch explained that they were looking to \"do what's the absolute best for each individual property I just want to honor the original DNA.\" Because of this, Sony was hoping that individual filmmakers would give each film its own distinct style rather than having a single person in charge of the universe as with the MCU's Kevin Feige The studio also wanted to avoid \"conventional comic-book movies\", with the intention of dealing in different genres such as horror or comedy, potential R-ratings, and even lower-than-usual budgets, depending on each project [29]\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe connections\nFeige stated in June 2017 that because Venom was solely a Sony project, Marvel Studios had no plans to have it crossover with the MCU [36] However, producer Amy Pascal soon clarified that Sony intended to have their new Marvel-based films take place in \"the same world\" as Spider-Man: Homecoming, describing them as \"adjunct\" to that world She said that Venom would have connections with the next planned film in Sony's shared universe, Silver & Black, and that there was potential for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to crossover from the MCU films to the films in Sony's universe [37] Holland was not contracted to appear outside of a trilogy of Spider-Man films and several other MCU films, but Sony intended to have the actor appear in their other Marvel films eventually [28] According to several reports, Holland spent several days during Venom's production filming a cameo appearance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man for the film, [38] [39] but Marvel Studios asked Sony to exclude the scene from the final film [40] By August 2018, Sony was actively planning to crossover Spider-Man with their own Marvel films, describing the character and Venom as \"already in the same universe.. we are looking forward to the two of them eventually facing off in the future\" [32] Sony was also open to more of their characters appearing in MCU films in exchange for more MCU characters appearing in their own films [2] In December, Venom writer Jeff Pinkner was asked if that film was set in the same universe as Holland's Spider-Man films, and he said, \"without revealing anything that I'm not allowed to reveal, it is not impossible that in a future/upcoming Venom movie, Spider-Man will play a significant role\" [41] Pascal added, in reference to a crossover between the MCU Spider-Man films, Sony's own shared universe films, and Sony's animated Spider-Verse films, that \"there's a world in which everything comes together\", but Holland was restricted by his contract with Marvel Studios at that time [34]\n\n\nExpansion to television\nVinciquerra stated in March 2019 that the universe would be expanding to television with a set of Marvel projects developed specifically by Sony Pictures Television At the time, the studio was \"essentially internally auditioning\" characters from the 900 it could access to decide which medium they would appear in, with Sony Pictures Television chairman Mike Hopkins describing their progress in selecting characters for television as \"pretty far down the road\" Hopkins elaborated that Sony planned to have several series set in the shared universe that could \"pollinate between each other\", and that they would be released by a yet-to-be-determined network partner An announcement of this partner was expected within the next few months, with the networks owned by Marvel's parent Disney—including their new streaming service Disney+—being considered alongside others These television plans were attributed to the success of Venom and Into the Spider-Verse, which \"bolstered confidence that there's an appetite for Sony's slice of Marvel\" [35]\n\n\nFilms\nFollowing a scandal, journalist Eddie Brock attempts to revive his career by investigating the Life

Spider-Man spin-offs [28] In July, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch explained that they were looking to \"do what's the absolute best for each individual property I just want to honor the original DNA.\" Because of this, Sony was hoping that individual filmmakers would give each film its own distinct style rather than having a single person in charge of the universe as with the MCU's Kevin Feige The studio also wanted to avoid \"conventional comic-book movies\", with the intention of dealing in different genres such as horror or comedy, potential R-ratings, and even lower-than-usual budgets, depending on each project [29]\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe connections\nFeige stated in June 2017 that because Venom was solely a Sony project, Marvel Studios had no plans to have it crossover with the MCU [36] However, producer Amy Pascal soon clarified that Sony intended to have their new Marvel-based films take place in \"the same world\" as Spider-Man: Homecoming, describing them as \"adjunct\" to that world She said that Venom would have connections with the next planned film in Sony's shared universe, Silver & Black, and that there was potential for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to crossover from the MCU films to the films in Sony's universe [37] Holland was not contracted to appear outside of a trilogy of Spider-Man films and several other MCU films, but Sony intended to have the actor appear in their other Marvel films eventually [28] According to several reports, Holland spent several days during Venom's production filming a cameo appearance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man for the film, [38] [39] but Marvel Studios asked Sony to exclude the scene from the final film [40] By August 2018, Sony was actively planning to crossover Spider-Man with their own Marvel films, describing the character and Venom as \"already in the same universe.. we are looking forward to the two of them eventually facing off in the future\" [32] Sony was also open to more of their characters appearing in MCU films in exchange for more MCU characters appearing in their own films [2] In December, Venom writer Jeff Pinkner was asked if that film was set in the same universe as Holland's Spider-Man films, and he said, \"without revealing anything that I'm not allowed to reveal, it is not impossible that in a future/upcoming Venom movie, Spider-Man will play a significant role\" [41] Pascal added, in reference to a crossover between the MCU Spider-Man films, Sony's own shared universe films, and Sony's animated Spider-Verse films, that \"there's a world in which everything comes together\", but Holland was restricted by his contract with Marvel Studios at that time [34]\n\n\nExpansion to television\nVinciquerra stated in March 2019 that the universe would be expanding to television with a set of Marvel projects developed specifically by Sony Pictures Television At the time, the studio was \"essentially internally auditioning\" characters from the 900 it could access to decide which medium they would appear in, with Sony Pictures Television chairman Mike Hopkins describing their progress in selecting characters for television as \"pretty far down the road\" Hopkins elaborated that Sony planned to have several series set in the shared universe that could \"pollinate between each other\", and that they would be released by a yet-to-be-determined network partner An announcement of this partner was expected within the next few months, with the networks owned by Marvel's parent Disney—including their new streaming service Disney+—being considered alongside others These television plans were attributed to the success of Venom and Into the Spider-Verse, which \"bolstered confidence that there's an appetite for Sony's slice of Marvel\" [35]\n\n\nFilms\nFollowing a scandal, journalist Eddie Brock attempts to revive his career by investigating the Life Foundation, but comes into contact with the alien symbiote Venom

word [24] [4] [25]\n\n\nHistory\nIn ancient times, Hajipur was known as Ukkacala [26] and was the first village after crossing the Ganga at Patna The village of Hajipur gained significance, as it was the venue of one of the discourses given by Buddha Buddha preached the Cula Gopalaka Sutta, a Middle Length Discourse, here Along with that, it is also of interest because a portion of Ananda's ashes were enshrined in the town Ananda, the closest disciple of Buddha, acted as the Buddha's attendant for twenty years and outlived him by several decades [27] [25] Hajipur is also known for the land of Amrapali [28]\n\n\nGeography and climate\nHajipur is the headquarters of Vaishali after its separation from Muzaffarpur district on 12 October 1972 It is located at 25°41′N 85°13′E﻿ / ﻿25.69°N

{"title": "The_Golden_Girls", "content": "\nPremise\nThe show, featuring an ensemble cast, revolves around four older single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur) after they both responded to an ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store a year before the start of the series In the pilot episode, the three are joined by Dorothy's 80-year-old widowed mother, Sophia Petrillo (Getty), after the retirement home where she has been living has burned down [8] [9]\n\n\nPilot\nThe first episode features a cook/butler named Coco (played by Charles Levin), but the role was dropped before the second episode The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food They decided that a separate cook would distract from their friendship In addition, the character of Sophia had originally been planned as an occasional guest star, but Getty had tested positively with preview audiences, so the producers decided to make her a regular character [10]\n\n\nFinale\nThe Golden Girls came to an end when Bea Arthur chose to leave the series In the hour-long series finale, which aired in May 1992, Dorothy meets and marries Blanche's uncle Lucas (Leslie Nielsen) and moves to Hollingsworth Manor in Atlanta Sophia is to join her, but in the end, she stays behind with the other women in Miami This led into the spin-off series The Golden Palace.\n\n\nEpisodes\nIdeas for a comedy series about older women emerged during the filming of a television special at NBC Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984

be cast Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role as the feisty mother of character Dorothy Zbornak, due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of Torch Song Trilogy Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York, but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985 Getty figured it would be her last chance to find television or film work She would return home to New York if she were unsuccessful.\n\n\nWriting and taping\nThe show was the second television series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company under the Touchstone Television label, and was subsequently distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc (which holds as the ownership stake in Disney Channel Southeast Asia, now Disney–ABC Television Group) [43]\n\n\nExterior and interior sets\nThe house's address was mentioned as being 6151 Richmond Street, Miami [55] The model used for exterior shots of the house from the third season through the end of the series was part of the backstage studio tour ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios This façade, along with the Empty Nest house, sustained hurricane damage leading to Disney's 2003 decision to bulldoze the houses of \"Residential Street\" and construct its Lights, Motors, Action!: Extreme Stunt Show attraction, later replaced by Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge The façade was based on a real house at 245 North Saltair Avenue in the Westgate Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles [56] Producers used this residence for exterior shots during the first two seasons [57] In 2020, owners marketed the property for $3 million [58]\n\n\nCostumes\nCostume designer Judy Evans created distinctive looks for each of the four actresses to suit their characters' personalities and to reflect the Florida setting According to Evans, \"I wanted a sexy, soft, and flowing look for Rue, a tailored, pulled-together look for Bea, a down-home look for Betty, and comfort for Estelle.\" [61] Anna Wyckoff of the Costume Designers Guild wrote, \"Evans took the direction from the producers to create a vibrant look for the four mature leads, and ran with it...redefining what 'dressing your age' looked like.\" [62] Many of the characters' outfits were designed by Evans and made especially, but seven to ten costume changes per episode were made between the four actresses, which entailed a great deal of off-the-rack shopping [63] Evans generally dressed the actresses in expensive pieces and high-quality fabrics, despite the recurring theme that the four characters were struggling with money, because, \"The main idea was to make them look good We didn't want the show to be about four dowdy ladies.\" [63]\n\n\nFormat\nThe Golden Girls was shot on videotape in front of a live studio audience [69] Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake, ice cream, or some other dessert [70] One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled the others with a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous, made-up stories) Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began [71] [self-published source?] Although the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes Bea Arthur actually hated cheesecake [72]\n\n\nReception\nOn Metacritic, the series has an overall score of 82 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [73]\n\n\nCritical reception\nOn Metacritic, the series has an overall score of 82 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [73]\n\n\nRatings\nAn instant ratings hit, The Golden Girls became an NBC staple on Saturday nights [75] The show was the anchor of NBC's Saturday line-up, and almost always won its time slot, as ABC and CBS struggled to find shows to compete against it, the most notable being ABC's Lucille Ball sitcom Life With Lucy in the beginning of the 1986–87 season although it aired at 8:00, an hour earlier The Golden Girls was part of a series of Brandon Tartikoff shows that put an end to NBC's ratings slump, along with The Cosby Show, 227, Night Court, Miami Vice, and L.A Law.\n\n\nNBC timeslots\nThe Season 3 episode \"Mixed Blessings\" was noted as controversial In it, Dorothy's son Michael (Scott Jacoby) plans to marry a black woman, Lorraine (Rosalind Cash) In one scene, Blanche and Rose walk out of the kitchen wearing mud masks and Rose says \"We're not black.\" Hulu pulled the episode in 2020 due to blackface concerns but, as an article in Vulture pointed out this was not an example of blackface; they were just mud masks As of 2023, the episode is back streaming on Hulu

[109]\n\n\nEmpty Nest\nSusan Harris developed a spin-off centering on empty nest syndrome The initial pilot was aired as the 1987 Golden Girls episode \"Empty Nests\", and starred Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno as George and Renee Corliss, a married couple living next to the Golden Girls characters, who face empty nest syndrome after their teenaged daughter goes to college [110] When that idea was not well received, Harris retooled the series as a vehicle for Richard Mulligan, and the following year Empty Nest debuted, starring Mulligan as pediatrician Harry Weston, a widower whose two adult

The show was created by Susan Harris and produced by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions in association with Touchstone Television. The series follows the lives of four older women, who share a house in Miami, Florida, and their relationships with each other and the people around them.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe show, featuring an ensemble cast, revolves around four older single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Arthur) after they both responded to an ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store a year before the start of the series. In the pilot episode, the three are joined by Dorothy's 80-year-old widowed mother, Sophia Petrillo (Getty), after the retirement home where she has been living has burned down.\n\n**Pilot**\n\nThe first episode features a cook/butler named Coco (played by Charles Levin), but the role was dropped before the second episode. The writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts, the main interaction between the women occurred in the kitchen while preparing and eating food. They decided that a separate cook would distract from their friendship. In addition, the character of Sophia had originally been planned as an occasional guest star, but Getty had tested positively with preview audiences, so the producers decided to make her a regular character.\n\n**Finale**\n\nThe Golden Girls came to an end when Bea Arthur chose to leave the series. In the hour-long series finale, which aired in May 1992, Dorothy meets and marries Blanche's uncle Lucas (Leslie Nielsen) and moves to Hollingsworth Manor in Atlanta. Sophia is to join her, but in the end, she stays behind with the other women in Miami. This led into the spin-off series The Golden Palace.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nIdeas for a comedy series about older women emerged during the filming of a television special at NBC Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984. Produced to introduce the network's 1984–85 season schedule, two actresses appearing on NBC shows, Selma Diamond of Night Court and Doris Roberts of Remington Steele, appeared in a skit promoting the upcoming show Miami Vice as Miami Nice, a parody about old people living in Miami. NBC senior vice president Warren Littlefield was among the executive producers in the audience who were amused by their performance, and he envisioned a series based on the geriatric humor the two were portraying.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe part of Sophia Petrillo was the first of the four roles to be cast. Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role as the feisty mother of character Dorothy Zbornak, due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of Torch Song Trilogy. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York, but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985. Getty figured it would be her last chance to find television or film work. She would return home to New York if she were unsuccessful.\n\n**Recurring**\n\nIdeas for a comedy series about older women emerged during the filming of a television special at NBC Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984.

The show was shot on videotape in front of a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma.\n\n**Writing and Taping**\n\nThe show was the second television series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company under the Touchstone Television label, and was subsequently distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc (which holds as the ownership stake in Disney Channel Southeast Asia, now Disney–ABC Television Group).

For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma.\n\n**Costumes**\n\nCostume designer Judy Evans created distinctive looks for each of the four actresses to suit their characters' personalities and to reflect the Florida setting. According to Evans, \"I wanted a sexy, soft, and flowing look for Rue, a tailored, pulled-together look for Bea, a down-home look for Betty, and comfort for Estelle.\" Anna Wyckoff of the Costume Designers Guild wrote, \"Evans took the direction from the producers to create a vibrant look for the four mature leads, and ran with it...redefining what 'dressing your age' looked like.\"\n\n**Format**\n\nThe show was the second television series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company under the Touchstone Television label, and was subsequently distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc (which holds as the ownership stake in Disney Channel Southeast Asia, now Disney–ABC Television Group).

For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma.\n\n**Ratings**\n\nAn instant ratings hit, The Golden Girls became an NBC staple on Saturday nights. The show was the anchor of NBC's Saturday line-up, and almost always won its time slot, as ABC and CBS struggled to find shows to compete against it, the most notable being ABC's Lucille Ball sitcom Life With Lucy in the beginning of the 1986–87 season although it aired at 8:00, an hour earlier The Golden Girls was part of a series of Brandon Tartikoff shows that put an end to NBC's ratings slump, along with The Cosby Show, 227, Night Court, Miami Vice, and L.A Law.\n\n**NBC Timeslots**\n\nThe Season 3 episode \"Mixed Blessings\" was noted as controversial. In it, Dorothy's son Michael (Scott Jacoby) plans to marry a black woman, Lorraine (Rosalind Cash). In one scene, Blanche and Rose walk out of the kitchen wearing mud masks and Rose says \"We're not black.\" Hulu pulled the episode in 2020 due to blackface concerns but, as an article in Vulture pointed out this was not an example of blackface; they were just mud masks. As of 2023, the episode is back streaming on Hulu.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nDuring its original run, The Golden Girls received 68 Emmy nominations, 11 Emmy awards, 4 Golden Globe Awards, and 2 Viewers for Quality Television awards. All the lead actresses won Emmy awards for their role on the show. The Golden Girls is one of four live-action shows, along with All in the Family, Will & Grace, and Schitt's Creek, where all the principal actors have won at least one Emmy.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nBeginning July 3, 1989, NBC added daytime reruns of the show, replacing long-running Wheel of Fortune (which had moved to CBS) on the NBC schedule at 11:00 am (EST); it ran until September 1990.

On November 9, 2010, the studio released a complete-series box set titled The Golden Girls: 25th Anniversary Complete Collection. The 21-disc collection features all 180 episodes of the series as well as all special features contained on the previously released season sets; it is encased in special collectible packaging, a replica of Sophia's purse.\n\n**Continuation and Spin-Offs**\n\nAfter the original series ended, White, McClanahan, and Getty reprised their characters in the CBS series The Golden Palace, which featured Rose, Blanche, and Sophia selling their house to buy and run a hotel in Miami. It ran from September 1992 to May 1993 and also starred Cheech Marin and Don Cheadle. Bea Arthur was not a part of the main cast but did guest star in a double episode, reprising her role as Dorothy.\n\n**Empty Nest**\n\nSusan Harris developed a spin-off centering on empty nest syndrome. The initial pilot was aired as the 1987 Golden Girls episode \"Empty Nests\", and starred Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno as George and Renee Corliss, a married couple living next to the Golden Girls characters, who face empty nest syndrome after their teenaged daughter goes to college. When that idea was not well received, Harris retooled the series as a vehicle for Richard Mulligan, and the following year Empty Nest debuted, starring Mulligan as pediatrician Harry Weston, a widower whose two adult daughters moved back home.\n\n**Nurses**\n\nEmpty Nest launched its own spin-off in 1991 set in Miami in the same hospital where Dr Weston worked.

of the series was part of the backstage studio tour ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios This façade, along with the Empty Nest house, sustained hurricane damage leading to Disney's 2003 decision to bulldoze the houses of \"Residential Street\" and construct its Lights, Motors, Action!: Extreme Stunt Show attraction, later replaced by Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge The façade was based on a real house

[62] Many of the characters' outfits were designed by Evans and made especially, but seven to ten costume changes per episode were made between the four actresses, which entailed a great deal of off-the-rack shopping [63] Evans generally dressed the actresses in expensive pieces and high-quality fabrics, despite the recurring theme that the four characters were struggling with money, because, \"The main idea was to make them look good We didn't want the show to be about four dowdy ladies.\" [63]\n\n\nFormat\nThe Golden Girls was shot on videotape in front of a live studio audience [69] Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake, ice cream, or some other dessert [70] One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled the others with a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous, made-up stories) Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began [71] [self-published source?] Although the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes Bea Arthur actually hated cheesecake

The paradox is named after the ancient Greek hero Theseus, who, according to legend, killed the Minotaur and sailed back to Athens in a ship that had been repaired and replaced with new parts over time.\n\n# History\n\nThe Ship of Theseus paradox concerns a debate over whether or not a ship that had all of its components replaced one by one would remain the same ship. The account of the problem has been preserved by Plutarch in his Life of Theseus. According to Plutarch, the ship had been repaired and replaced with new parts so many times that it was no longer recognizable as the same vessel. The question was raised: if every part of the ship was replaced, was it still the same ship?\n\n# Proposed Resolutions\n\nThe Ship of Theseus paradox can be thought of as an example of a puzzle of material constitution – that is, a problem with determining the relationship between an object and the material of which it is made. Philosophers have proposed various solutions to this paradox, each attempting to address the question of what constitutes the identity of an object over time.\n\n## Constitution is not Identity\n\nOne of the most popular solutions is to accept the conclusion that the material out of which the ship is made is not the same object as the ship, but that the two objects simply occupy the same space at the same time. This view suggests that the identity of an object is not solely determined by its material constituents, but rather by its functional and relational properties.\n\n## Temporal Parts\n\nAnother common theory, put forth by David Lewis, is to divide up all objects into three-dimensional time-slices which are temporally distinct. This approach avoids the issue that the two different ships exist in the same space at one time and a different space at another time by considering the objects to be distinct from each other at all points in time.\n\n## Cognitive Science\n\nAccording to some scientists, the thought puzzle arises because of extreme externalism: the assumption that what is true in our minds also holds true in the world. Noam Chomsky has suggested that this is not an unassailable assumption, from the perspective of the natural sciences, because human intuition is often mistaken. Cognitive science would treat this thought puzzle as the subject of an investigation of the human mind. Studying this human confusion can reveal much about the brain's operation, but little about the nature of the human-independent external world.\n\n## Deflationism\n\nThe deflationist view is that the facts of the thought experiment are undisputed; the only dispute is over the meaning of the term \"ship\" and is thus merely verbal. American philosopher Hilary Putnam has asserted that \"the logical primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object and existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one absolute 'meaning'.\" This thesis – that there are many meanings for the existential quantifier that are equally natural and equally adequate for describing all the facts – is often referred to as \"the doctrine of quantifier variance.\"\n\n## Continued Identity Theory\n\nThis solution sees an object as staying the same as long as it continuously and metaphysically exists under the same identity without being fully transformed at one time. For instance, a house that has its front wall destroyed and replaced at Year One, the ceiling replaced at Year Two, and so on, until every part of the house has been replaced will still be understood as the same house. However, if every wall, the floor, and the roof are destroyed and replaced at the same time, it will be known as a new house.\n\n# Alternative Forms\n\nIn Europe, several independent tales and stories feature knives of which the blades and handles had been replaced several times but are still used and represent the same knife. France has Jeannot's knife, Spain uses Jeannot's knife as a proverb, and Hungary has \"Lajos Kossuth's pocket knife.\" Several variants or alternative statements of the underlying problem are known, including the grandfather's axe and Trigger's broom, where an old axe or broom has had both its head and its handle replaced, leaving no original components.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Paradox of the heap\n* Identity crisis\n* Material constitution\n* Temporal parts\n* Cognitive science\n* Deflationism\n* Quantifier variance\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* Lewis, D.

1866 elections [55] Anti-Johnson Republicans won a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress following the elections, which helped lead the way toward his impeachment and near ouster from office in 1868, [55] the same year Ulysses S Grant was elected as the next Republican president.\n\n\nFirst half of the 20th century\nThe 1896 realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while president Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his embrace of trust busting He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in the 1908 election, but they became enemies as the party split down the middle Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new Progressive Party He called for social reforms, many of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking, leading to

Republican Party [77]\n\n\nRoosevelt and the New Deal era\nThe New Deal coalition forged by Democratic president Franklin D Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excluding the presidency of Republican Dwight D Eisenhower in the 1950s After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933 The 1934 elections left the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats The House likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities [82]\n\n\nSecond half of the 20th century\nEisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator Robert A Taft for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position [87]\n\n\nPost-Roosevelt era\nEisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator Robert A Taft for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position [87]\n\n\nFrom Goldwater to Reagan\nHistorians cite the 1964 presidential election and its respective National Convention as a significant shift, which saw the conservative wing, helmed by Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, battle liberal New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and his eponymous Rockefeller Republican faction for the nomination With Goldwater poised to win, Rockefeller, urged to mobilize his liberal faction, retorted, \"You're looking at it, buddy I'm all that's left.\" [88] [89]\n\n\nReagan era\nThe Reagan presidency, lasting from 1981 to 1989, constituted what is known as \"the Reagan Revolution\" [91] It was seen as a fundamental shift from the stagflation of the 1970s, with the introduction of Reagan's economic policies intended to cut taxes, prioritize government deregulation and shift funding from the domestic sphere into the military to check the Soviet Union by utilizing deterrence theory During a visit to then-West Berlin in June 1987, he addressed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall, demanding that he \"Tear down this wall!\" The remark was later seen as influential in the fall of the wall in 1989, and was retroactively seen as a defining achievement [92] The Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991 [93] [94] [95] Following Reagan's presidency, Republican presidential candidates frequently claimed to share Reagan's views and aimed to portray themselves and their policies as heirs to his legacy [96]\n\n\nGingrich Revolution\nIn the 1994 elections, the Republican Party, led by House minority whip Newt Gingrich, who campaigned on the \"Contract with America\", won majorities in both chambers of Congress, gained 12 governorships, and regained control of 20 state legislatures The Republican Party won control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, and won a majority of U.S House seats in the South for the first time since Reconstruction [99] [100]\n\n\n21st century\nRepublicans began the 21st century with the election of George W Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the September 11 attacks through the War on Terror [218] The election of Barack Obama saw the formation of the Tea Party movement in 2009 that coincided with a global rise in right-wing populist movements from the 2010s to 2020's [219]\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush\nRepublican George W Bush won the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections [114] He campaigned as a \"compassionate conservative\" in 2000, wanting to better appeal to immigrants and minority voters [115] The goal was to prioritize drug rehabilitation programs and aid for prisoner reentry into society, a move intended to capitalize on President Clinton's tougher crime initiatives such as his administration's 1994 crime bill The platform failed to gain much traction among members of the party during his presidency [116]\n\n\nTea Party movement\nThe Republicans experienced electoral success in the 2010 elections The 2010 elections coincided with the ascendancy of the Tea Party movement, [127] [128] [129] [130] an anti-Obama protest movement of fiscal conservatives [131] Members of the movement called for lower taxes, and for a reduction of the national debt and federal budget deficit through decreased government spending [132] [133] The Tea Party movement was also described as a popular constitutional movement [134] composed of a mixture of libertarian, [135] right-wing populist, [136] and conservative activism [137]\n\n\nTrump era\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Republican nominee Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton The result was unexpected; polls leading up to the election showed Clinton leading the race [150] Trump's victory was fueled by narrow victories in three states—Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—that had been part of the Democratic blue wall for decades [151] It was attributed to strong support amongst working-class white voters, who felt dismissed and disrespected by the political establishment [152] [153] Trump became popular with them by abandoning Republican establishment orthodoxy in favor of a broader nationalist message [151] His election accelerated the Republican Party's shift towards right-wing populism and resulted in decreasing influence among its conservative factions [a]\n\n\nCurrent status\nAs of 2024, the GOP holds a majority in the U.S House of Representatives It also holds 27 state governorships, 28 state legislatures, and 23 state government trifectas Six of the nine current U.S Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents Its most recent presidential nominee is Donald Trump, who served as the 45th president of the United States and was the party's candidate again in the 2024 presidential election [199] There have been 19 Republican presidents, the most from any one political party.\n\n\nName and symbols\nThe Republican Party's founding members chose its name as homage to the values of republicanism promoted by Democratic-Republican Party, which its founder, Thomas Jefferson, called the \"Republican Party\" [200] The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party's leading publicist, Horace Greeley, who called for \"some simple name like 'Republican'  [that] would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery\" [201] The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption [202] \"Republican\" has a variety of meanings around the world, and the Republican Party has evolved such that the meanings no longer always align [203] [123]\n\n\nFactions\nDuring the 19th century, Republican factions included the Radical Republicans They were a major factor of the party from its inception in 1854 until the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877 They strongly opposed slavery, were hard-line abolitionists, and later advocated equal rights for the freedmen and women They were heavily influenced by religious ideals and evangelical Christianity; many were Christian reformers who saw slavery as evil and the Civil War as God's punishment for it [214] Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of Abraham Lincoln as both too lenient on the Confederates and not going far enough to help former slaves who had been freed during or after the Civil War by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment After the war's end and Lincoln's assassination, the Radicals clashed with Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction policy Radicals led efforts after the war to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement emancipation After unsuccessful measures in 1866 resulted in violence against former slaves in the rebel states, Radicals pushed the Fourteenth Amendment for statutory protections through Congress They opposed allowing ex-Confederate officers to retake political power in the Southern U.S., and emphasized liberty, equality, and the Fifteenth Amendment which provided voting rights for the freedmen Many later became Stalwarts, who supported machine politics.\n\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction era\nDuring the 19th century, Republican factions included

the Northeast that eventually became known as Rockefeller Republicans Opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal saw the formation of the conservative coalition [83] The 1950s saw fusionism of traditionalist and social conservatism and right-libertarianism, [216] along with the rise of the First New Right to be followed in 1964 with a more populist Second New Right [217] The rise of the Reagan coalition via the \"Reagan Revolution\" in the 1980s began what has been called the Reagan era Reagan's rise displaced the liberal-moderate faction of the GOP and established Reagan-style conservatism as the prevailing ideological faction of the Party for the next thirty years, until the rise of the right-wing populist faction [9] [23]\n\n\n21st century\nRepublicans began the 21st century with the election of George W Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the

from the 2010s to 2020's [219]\n\n\nConservatives\nRonald Reagan's presidential election in 1980 established Reagan-style American conservatism as the dominant ideological faction of the Republican Party until the election of Donald Trump in 2016 [9] [22] [13] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] Trump's election split both the GOP and larger conservative movement into Trumpist and anti-Trump factions [230] [231] The party has since undergone a major decrease in the influence of its establishment conservative faction [22] [13] [232] [24] The party has also lost majority support from white voters with college degrees, while continuing to gain among white voters without college degrees [32] [33]\n\n\nChristian right\nSince the rise of the Christian right in the 1970s, the Republican Party has drawn significant support from evangelicals, Mormons, [250] and traditionalist Catholics, partly due to opposition to abortion after Roe v Wade [251] The Christian right faction is characterized by strong support of socially conservative and Christian nationalist policies [c] Christian conservatives seek to use the teachings of Christianity to influence law and public policy [264] Compared to other Republicans, the socially conservative Christian right faction of the party is more likely to oppose LGBT rights, marijuana legalization, and support significantly restricting the legality of abortion [265]\n\n\nLibertarians\nThe Republican Party has a prominent right-libertarian faction [12] [246] This faction of the party tends to prevail in the Midwestern and Western United States [246] Right-libertarianism emerged from fusionism in the 1950s and 60s [270] Barry Goldwater had a substantial impact on the conservative-libertarian movement of the 1960s [271] Compared to other Republicans, they are more likely to favor the legalization of marijuana, LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage, gun rights, oppose mass surveillance, and support reforms to current laws surrounding civil asset forfeiture Right-wing libertarians are strongly divided on the subject of abortion [272] Prominent libertarian conservatives within the Republican Party include Rand Paul, a U.S senator from Kentucky, [273] [274] Kentucky's 4th congressional district congressman Thomas Massie, [275] Utah senator Mike Lee [276] [273] and Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis [277]\n\n\nModerates\nModerates in the Republican Party are an ideologically centrist group that predominantly come from the Northeastern United States, [278] and are typically located in swing states or blue states Moderate Republican voters are typically highly educated, [279] affluent, fiscally conservative, socially moderate or liberal and often Never Trump [246] [278] While they sometimes share the economic views of other Republicans (i.e lower taxes, deregulation, and welfare reform), moderate Republicans differ in that some are for affirmative action, [280] LGBT rights and same-sex marriage, legal access to and even public funding for abortion, gun control laws, more environmental regulation and action on climate change, fewer restrictions on immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants [281] In the 21st century, some former Republican moderates have switched to the Democratic Party [282] [283] [284]\n\n\nRight-wing populists\nRight-wing populism is the dominant political faction of the GOP [d] Sometimes referred to as the MAGA or \"America First\" movement, [301] [302] Republican populists have been described as consisting of a range of right-wing ideologies including but not limited to right-wing populism, [152] [303] [304] national conservatism, [305] neo-nationalism, [306] and Trumpism [294] [307] [308] They have been described as the American political variant of the far-right [e] The election of Trump in 2016 split the party into pro-Trump and anti-Trump factions [230] [231]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDefunct\n\n\nEconomic policies\nRepublicans believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity [355] Reduction in income taxes is a core component of Republicans' fiscal agenda [356]\n\n\nTaxes\nTax cuts have been at the core of Republican economic policy since 1980 [357] At the national level and state level, Republicans tend to pursue policies of tax cuts and deregulation [358] Modern Republicans advocate the theory of supply-side economics, which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth [359] Many Republicans oppose higher tax rates for higher earners, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending Republican lawmakers have also sought to limit funding for tax enforcement and tax collection [360]\n\n\nSpending\nRepublicans frequently advocate in favor of fiscal conservatism during Democratic administrations; however, the party has a record of increasing federal debt during periods when it controls the government (the implementation of the Bush tax cuts, Medicare Part D and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are examples of this record) [366] [367] [368] Republican administrations have, since the late 1960s, sustained or increased previous levels of government spending [369] [370]\n\n\nEntitlements\nRepublicans believe individuals should take responsibility for their own circumstances They also believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor through charity than the government is through welfare programs and that social assistance programs often cause government dependency [371] As of November 2022, all 11 states that had not expanded Medicaid had Republican-controlled state legislatures [372]\n\n\nLabor unions and the minimum wage\nThe Republican Party is generally opposed to labor unions [373] [374] Republicans believe corporations should be able to establish their own employment practices, including benefits and wages, with the free market deciding the price of work Since the 1920s, Republicans have generally been opposed by labor union organizations and members At the national level, Republicans supported the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various right-to-work laws [f] [citation needed]\n\n\nTrade\nThe Republican Party has taken widely varying views on international trade throughout its history The official Republican Party platform adopted in 2024 opposes free trade and supports enacting tariffs on imports, though it supports maintaining existing free trade agreements [378] At its inception, the Republican Party supported protective tariffs, with the Morrill Tariff being implemented during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln [379] [377] In the 1896 presidential election, Republican presidential candidate William McKinley campaigned heavily on high tariffs, having been the creator and namesake for the McKinley Tariff of 1890 [72]\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nHistorically, progressive leaders in the Republican Party supported environmental protection Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the National Park Service [397] While Republican President Richard Nixon was not an environmentalist, he signed legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and had a comprehensive environmental program [398] However, this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy [399] Since then, Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation, [400] [401] [402] with many Republicans rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change [399] [403] [404] [405] Republican voters are divided over the human causes of climate change and global warming [406] Since 2008, [407] many members of the Republican Party have been criticized for being anti-environmentalist [408] [409] [410] and promoting climate change denial [411] [412] [413] in opposition to the general scientific consensus, making them unique even among other worldwide conservative parties [413]\n\n\nHealth care\nThe party opposes a single-payer health care system, [429] [430] describing it as socialized medicine It also opposes the Affordable Care Act [431] and expansions of Medicaid [432] Historically, there have been diverse and overlapping views within both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party on the role of government in health care, but the two parties became highly polarized on the topic during 2008–2009 and onwards [433]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe Republican Party has a persistent history of skepticism and opposition to multilateralism in American foreign policy [440] Neoconservatism, which supports unilateralism and emphasizes the use of force and hawkishness in American foreign policy, has had some influence in all Republican presidential administration since Ronald Reagan's presidency [441] Some, including paleoconservatives, [442] call for non-interventionism and an isolationist \"America First\" foreign policy agenda [34] [241] [242] This faction gained strength starting in 2016 with the rise of Donald Trump, demanding that the United States reset its previous interventionist foreign policy and encourage allies and partners to take greater responsibility for their own defense [443]\n\n\nIsrael\nDuring the 1940s, Republicans predominantly opposed the cause of an independent Jewish state due to the influence of conservatives of the Old Right [444] In 1948, Democratic President Harry Truman became the first world leader to recognize an independent state of Israel, [445] though Truman's pro-Israel stance had the notable support of Robert A Taft, a leading Senate Republican and an early advocate for military support to Israel [446]\n\n\nTaiwan\nIn the party's 2016 platform, [454] its stance on Taiwan is: \"We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island's future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan.\" In addition, if \"China were to violate those principles, the United States, in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act, will help Taiwan defend itself\".\n\n\nWar on terror\nSince the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, neoconservatives in the party have supported the War on Terror, including the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War The George W Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants, while other prominent Republicans, such as Ted Cruz, strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which they view as torture [455] In the 2020s, Trumpist Republicans such as Matt Gaetz supported reducing U.S military presence abroad and ending intervention in countries such as Somalia [456]\n\n\nEurope, Russia and Ukraine\nThe 2016 Republican platform eliminated references to giving weapons to Ukraine in its fight with Russia and rebel forces; the removal of this language reportedly resulted from intervention from staffers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump [457] However, the Trump administration approved a new sale of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in 2017 [458] Republicans generally question European NATO members' insufficient investment in defense funding, and some are dissatisfied with U.S aid to Ukraine [459] [460] Some Republican members of the U.S Congress support foreign aid to Israel but not to Ukraine, [325] [326] and are accused by U.S media of being pro-Russian [246] [327] [328] [329] [330] [331] [332]\n\n\nForeign relations and aid\nIn a 2014 poll, 59% of Republicans favored doing less abroad and focusing on the country's own problems instead [471]\n\n\nSocial issues\nThe Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies, although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions The social conservatives support laws that uphold their traditional values, such as opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and marijuana [476] The Republican Party's positions on social and cultural issues are in part a reflection of the influential role that the Christian right has had in the party since the 1970s [477] [478] [479] Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control, affirmative action, and illegal immigration [476] [480]\n\n\nAbortion and embryonic stem cell research\nThe Republican position on abortion has changed significantly over time [251] [481] During the 1960s and early 1970s, opposition to abortion was concentrated among members of the political left and the Democratic Party; most liberal Catholics — which tended to vote for the Democratic Party — opposed expanding abortion access while most conservative evangelical Protestants supported it [481]\n\n\nAffirmative action\nRepublicans generally oppose affirmative action, often describing it as a \"quota system\" and believing that it is not meritocratic and is counter-productive socially by only further promoting discrimination According to a 2023 ABC poll, a majority of Americans (52%) and 75% of Republicans supported the Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard prohibiting race as a factor in college admissions, compared to only 26% of Democrats [501]\n\n\nGun ownership\nRepublicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 45% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents personally own firearms, compared to 32% for the general public and 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [507]\n\n\nDrug legalization\nRepublican elected officials have historically supported the War on Drugs They generally oppose legalization or decriminalization of drugs such as marijuana [513] [514] [515]\n\n\nImmigration\nThe Republican Party has taken widely varying views on immigration throughout its history [9] In the period between 1850 and 1870, the Republican Party was more opposed to immigration than the Democrats The GOP's opposition was, in part, caused by its reliance on the support of anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant parties such as the Know-Nothings In the decades following the Civil War, the Republican Party grew more supportive of immigration, as it represented manufacturers in the northeast (who wanted additional labor); during this period, the Democratic Party came to be seen as the party of labor (which wanted fewer laborers with which to compete) Starting in the 1970s, the parties switched places again, as the Democrats grew more supportive of immigration than Republicans [519]\n\n\nLGBT issues\nSimilar to the Democratic Party, the Republican position on LGBT rights has changed significantly over time, with continuously increasing support among both parties on the issue [528] [529] The Log Cabin Republicans is a group within the Republican Party that represents LGBT conservatives and allies and advocates for LGBT rights [530] [531]\n\n\nVoting rights\nVirtually all restrictions on voting have in recent years been implemented by Republicans Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as the purging of voter rolls, limiting voting locations, and limiting early and mail-in voting) are vital to prevent voter fraud, saying that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections Polling has found majority support for early voting, automatic voter registration and voter ID laws among the general population [574] [575] [576]\n\n\nComposition\nAccording to a 2015 Gallup poll, 25% of Americans identify as Republican and 16% identify as leaning Republican In comparison, 30% identify as Democratic and 16% identify as leaning Democratic The Democratic Party has typically held an overall edge in party identification since Gallup began polling on the issue in 1991 [601] In 2016, The New York Times stated that the party was strongest in the South, most of the Midwestern and Mountain States, and Alaska [602]\n\n\nDemographics\nSince 1980, a \"gender gap\" has seen stronger support for the Republican Party among men than among women Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Democrat John Kerry than for Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election [613] In 2006 House races, 43% of women voted Republican while 47% of men did so [614] In the 2010 midterms, the \"gender gap\" was reduced, with women supporting Republican and Democratic candidates equally (49%–49%) [615] [616] Exit polls from the 2012 elections revealed a continued weakness among unmarried women for the GOP, a large and growing portion of the electorate [617] Although women supported Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of 55–44% in 2012, Romney prevailed amongst married women, 53–46% [618] Obama won unmarried women 67–31% [619]\n\n\nGender\nSince 1980, a \"gender gap\" has seen stronger support for the Republican Party among men than among women Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Democrat John Kerry than for Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election [613] In 2006 House races, 43% of women voted Republican while 47% of men did so [614] In the 2010 midterms, the \"gender gap\" was reduced, with women supporting Republican and Democratic candidates equally (49%–49%) [615] [616] Exit polls from the 2012 elections revealed a continued weakness among unmarried women for the GOP, a large and growing portion of the electorate [617] Although women supported Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of 55–44% in 2012, Romney prevailed amongst married women, 53–46% [618] Obama won unmarried women 67–31% [619]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Republican Party has steadily increased the percentage of votes it receives from white voters without college degrees since the 1970s, while the educational attainment of the United States has steadily increased [33] [314] White voters without college degrees tend to be more socially conservative and are more likely to live in rural areas [623] [624]\n\n\nEthnicity\nRepublicans have been winning under 15% of the African American vote in national elections since 1980 The party abolished chattel slavery under Abraham Lincoln, defeated the Slave Power, and gave Black people the legal right to vote during Reconstruction in the late 1860s Until the New Deal of the 1930s, Black people supported the Republican Party by large margins [635] Black delegates were a sizable share of southern delegates to the national Republican convention from Reconstruction until the start of the 20th century when their share began to decline [636] Black people shifted in large margins to the Democratic Party in the 1930s, when Black politicians such as Arthur Mitchell and William Dawson supported the New Deal because it would better serve the interest of Black Americans [637] Black voters would become one of the core components of the New Deal coalition In the South, after the Voting Rights Act to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a bipartisan coalition in 1965, Black people were able to vote again and ever since have formed a significant portion (20–50%) of the Democratic vote in that region [638]\n\n\nReligious communities\nReligion has always played a major role for both parties, but in the course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960, with Catholics, Jews, and southern Protestants heavily Democratic and northeastern Protestants heavily Republican Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 1980s that undercut the New Deal coalition [662] Voters who attended church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in 2004; those who attended occasionally gave him only 47%; and those who never attended gave him 36% Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though John Kerry was Catholic) Since 1980, a large majority of evangelicals has voted Republican; 70–80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004 and 70% for Republican House candidates in 2006.\n\n\nMembers of the business community\nThe Republican Party has traditionally been a pro-business party It garners major support from a wide variety of industries from the financial sector to small businesses Republicans are 24 percent more likely to be business owners than Democrats [675] Prominent business lobbying groups such as the U.S Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers have traditionally supported Republican candidates and economic policies [676] [677] Although both major parties support capitalism, the Republican Party is more likely to favor private property rights (including intellectual property rights) than the Democratic Party over competing interests such as protecting the environment or lowering medication costs [678] [679] [680]\n\n\nRepublican presidents\nAs of 2021, there have been a total of 19 Republican presidents.\n\n\nRecent electoral history\n\n\nIn congressional elections: 1950–present\n\n\nIn presidential elections: 1856–present\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

It is also known as the Grand Old Party (GOP). The party was founded in 1854 by anti-slavery activists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers. The party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant Democratic Party and the briefly popular Know Nothing Party.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe Republican Party was founded in the Northern United States by forces opposed to the expansion of slavery, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers. The party grew out of opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise and opened the Kansas and Nebraska Territories to slavery and future admission as slave states. They denounced the expansion of slavery as a great evil, but did not call for complete abolition, including in the Southern states. While opposition to the expansion of slavery was the most consequential founding principle of the party, like the Whig Party it replaced, Republicans also called for economic and social modernization.\n\n19th century\n------------\n\nIn the 1854 election, the Republican Party was founded in the Northern United States by forces opposed to the expansion of slavery, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers.

Johnson was vitriolic in his criticisms of the Radical Republicans during a national tour ahead of the 1866 elections. Anti-Johnson Republicans won a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress following the elections, which helped lead the way toward his impeachment and near ouster from office in 1868, the same year Ulysses S Grant was elected as the next Republican president.\n\nFirst half of the 20th century\n-----------------------------\n\nThe 1896 realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while president Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his embrace of trust busting. He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in the 1908 election, but they became enemies as the party split down the middle. Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination. Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new Progressive Party. He called for social reforms, many of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s. He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking, leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party.\n\nProgressives vs. Standpatters\n-----------------------------\n\nThe 1896 realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while president Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his embrace of trust busting.

He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking, leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party.\n\nRoosevelt and the New Deal era\n-----------------------------\n\nThe New Deal coalition forged by Democratic president Franklin D Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excluding the presidency of Republican Dwight D Eisenhower in the 1950s. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. The 1934 elections left the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats. The House likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.\n\nSecond half of the 20th century\n-----------------------------\n\nEisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator Robert A Taft for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration. Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position.\n\nFrom Goldwater to Reagan\n------------------------\n\nHistorians cite the 1964 presidential election and its respective National Convention as a significant shift, which saw the conservative wing, helmed by Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, battle liberal New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and his eponymous Rockefeller Republican faction for the nomination. With Goldwater poised to win, Rockefeller, urged to mobilize his liberal faction, retorted, \"You're looking at it, buddy. I'm all that's left.\"\n\nReagan era\n------------\n\nThe Reagan presidency, lasting from 1981 to 1989, constituted what is known as \"the Reagan Revolution.\" It was seen as a fundamental shift from the stagflation of the 1970s, with the introduction of Reagan's economic policies intended to cut taxes, prioritize government deregulation, and shift funding from the domestic sphere into the military to check the Soviet Union by utilizing deterrence theory. During a visit to then-West Berlin in June 1987, he addressed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall, demanding that he \"Tear down this wall!\" The remark was later seen as influential in the fall of the wall in 1989, and was retroactively seen as a defining achievement. The Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991.\n\nGingrich Revolution\n-------------------\n\nIn the 1994 elections, the Republican Party, led by House minority whip Newt Gingrich, who campaigned on the \"Contract with America,\" won majorities in both chambers of Congress, gained 12 governorships, and regained control of 20 state legislatures. The Republican Party won control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years and won a majority of U.S House seats in the South for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\n21st century\n------------\n\nRepublicans began the 21st century with the election of George W Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the September 11 attacks through the War on Terror. The election of Barack Obama saw the formation of the Tea Party movement in 2009 that coincided with a global rise in right-wing populist movements from the 2010s to 2020's.\n\nConservatives\n-------------\n\nRonald Reagan's presidential election in 1980 established Reagan-style American conservatism as the dominant ideological faction of the Republican Party until the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Trump's election split both the GOP and larger conservative movement into Trumpist and anti-Trump factions. The party has since undergone a major decrease in the influence of its establishment conservative faction.\n\nChristian right\n-----------------\n\nSince the rise of the Christian right in the 1970s, the Republican Party has drawn significant support from evangelicals, Mormons, and traditionalist Catholics, partly due to opposition to abortion after Roe v Wade. The Christian right faction is characterized by strong support of socially conservative and Christian nationalist policies. Christian conservatives seek to use the teachings of Christianity to influence law and public policy.\n\nLibertarians\n-------------\n\nThe Republican Party has a prominent right-libertarian faction. This faction of the party tends to prevail in the Midwestern and Western United States. Right-libertarians are more likely to favor the legalization of marijuana, LGBT rights, gun rights, oppose mass surveillance, and support reforms to current laws surrounding civil asset forfeiture.\n\nModerates\n----------\n\nModerates in the Republican Party are an ideologically centrist group that predominantly come from the Northeastern United States. They are typically located in swing states or blue states. Moderate Republican voters are typically highly educated, affluent, fiscally conservative, socially moderate or liberal, and often Never Trump.\n\nRight-wing populists\n-------------------\n\nRight-wing populism is the dominant political faction of the GOP. Sometimes referred to as the MAGA or \"America First\" movement, right-wing populists have been described as consisting of a range of right-wing ideologies, including but not limited to right-wing populism, national conservatism, neo-nationalism, and Trumpism.\n\nEconomic policies\n-----------------\n\nRepublicans believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity.

enemies as the party split down the middle Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new Progressive Party He called for social reforms, many of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking, leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party [77]\n\n\nProgressives vs. Standpatters\nThe 1896 realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big businesses while president Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his embrace of trust busting He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in the 1908 election, but they became enemies as the party split down the middle Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new Progressive Party He called for social reforms, many of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP, they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking, leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party [77]\n\n\nRoosevelt and the New Deal era\nThe New Deal coalition forged by Democratic president Franklin D Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excluding the presidency of Republican Dwight D Eisenhower in the 1950s After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933 The 1934 elections left the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats The House likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities [82]\n\n\nSecond half of the 20th century\nEisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator Robert A Taft for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position [87]\n\n\nPost-Roosevelt era\nEisenhower had defeated conservative leader senator Robert A Taft for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position [87]\n\n\nFrom Goldwater to Reagan\nHistorians cite the 1964 presidential election and its respective National Convention as a significant shift, which saw the conservative wing, helmed by Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, battle liberal New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and his eponymous Rockefeller Republican faction for the nomination With Goldwater poised to win, Rockefeller, urged to mobilize his liberal faction, retorted, \"You're looking at it, buddy I'm all that's left.\" [88] [89]\n\n\nReagan era\nThe Reagan presidency, lasting from 1981 to 1989, constituted what is known as \"the Reagan Revolution\" [91] It was seen as a fundamental shift from the stagflation of the 1970s, with the introduction of Reagan's economic policies intended to cut taxes, prioritize government deregulation and shift funding from the domestic sphere into the military to check the Soviet Union by utilizing deterrence theory During a visit to then-West Berlin in June 1987, he addressed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall, demanding that he \"Tear down this wall!\" The remark was later seen as influential in the fall of the wall in 1989, and was retroactively seen as a defining achievement [92] The Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991 [93] [94] [95] Following Reagan's presidency, Republican presidential candidates frequently claimed to share Reagan's views and aimed to portray themselves and their policies as heirs to his legacy [96]\n\n\nGingrich Revolution\nIn the 1994 elections, the Republican Party, led by House minority whip Newt Gingrich, who campaigned on the \"Contract with America\", won majorities in both chambers of Congress, gained 12 governorships, and regained control of 20 state legislatures The Republican Party won control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years, and won a majority of U.S House seats in the South for the first time since Reconstruction [99] [100]\n\n\n21st century\nRepublicans began the 21st century with the election of George W Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the September 11 attacks through the War on Terror [218] The election of Barack Obama saw the formation of the Tea Party movement in 2009 that coincided with a global rise in right-wing populist movements from the 2010s to 2020's [219]\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush\nRepublican George W Bush won the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections [114] He campaigned as a \"compassionate conservative\" in 2000, wanting to better appeal to immigrants and minority voters [115] The goal was to prioritize drug rehabilitation programs and aid for prisoner reentry into society, a move intended to capitalize on President Clinton's tougher crime initiatives such as his administration's 1994 crime bill The platform failed to gain much traction among members of the party during his presidency [116]\n\n\nTea Party movement\nThe Republicans experienced electoral success in the 2010 elections The 2010 elections coincided with the ascendancy of the Tea Party movement, [127] [128] [129] [130] an anti-Obama protest movement of fiscal conservatives [131] Members of the movement called for lower taxes, and for a reduction of the national debt and federal budget deficit through decreased government spending [132] [133] The Tea Party movement was also described as a popular constitutional movement [134] composed of a mixture of libertarian, [135] right-wing populist, [136] and conservative activism [137]\n\n\nTrump era\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Republican nominee Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton The result was unexpected; polls leading up to the election showed Clinton leading the race [150] Trump's victory was fueled by narrow victories in three states—Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—that had been part of the Democratic blue wall for decades [151] It was attributed to strong support amongst working-class white voters, who felt dismissed and disrespected by the political establishment [152] [153] Trump became popular with them by abandoning Republican establishment orthodoxy in favor of a broader nationalist message [151] His election accelerated the Republican Party's shift towards right-wing populism and resulted in decreasing influence among its conservative factions [a]\n\n\nCurrent status\nAs of 2024, the GOP holds a majority in the U.S House of Representatives It also holds 27 state governorships, 28 state legislatures, and 23 state government trifectas Six of the nine current U.S Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents Its most recent presidential nominee is Donald Trump, who served as the 45th president of the United States and was the party's candidate again in the 2024 presidential election [199] There have been 19 Republican presidents, the most from any one political party.\n\n\nName and symbols\nThe Republican Party's founding members chose its name as homage to the values of republicanism promoted by Democratic-Republican Party, which its founder, Thomas Jefferson, called the \"Republican Party\" [200] The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party's leading publicist, Horace Greeley, who called for \"some simple name like 'Republican'  [that] would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery\" [201] The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption [202] \"Republican\" has a variety of meanings around the world, and the Republican Party has evolved such that the meanings no longer always align [203] [123]\n\n\nFactions\nDuring the 19th century, Republican factions included the Radical Republicans They were a major factor of the party from its inception in 1854 until the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877 They strongly opposed slavery, were hard-line abolitionists, and later advocated equal rights for the freedmen and women They were heavily influenced by religious ideals and evangelical Christianity; many were Christian reformers who saw slavery as evil and the Civil War as God's punishment for it [214] Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of Abraham Lincoln as both too lenient on the Confederates and not going far enough to help former slaves who had been freed during or after the Civil War by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment After the war's end and Lincoln's assassination, the Radicals clashed with Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction policy Radicals led efforts after the war to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement emancipation After unsuccessful measures in 1866 resulted in violence against former slaves in the rebel states, Radicals pushed the Fourteenth Amendment for statutory protections through Congress They opposed allowing ex-Confederate officers to retake political power in the Southern U.S., and emphasized liberty, equality, and the Fifteenth Amendment which provided voting rights for the freedmen Many later became Stalwarts, who supported machine politics.\n\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction era\nDuring the 19th century, Republican factions included the Radical Republicans They were a major factor of the party from its inception in 1854 until the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877 They strongly opposed slavery, were hard-line abolitionists, and later advocated equal rights for the freedmen and women They were heavily influenced by religious ideals and evangelical Christianity; many were Christian reformers who saw slavery as evil and the Civil War as God's punishment for it [214] Radical Republicans pressed for abolition as a major war aim and they opposed the moderate Reconstruction plans of Abraham Lincoln as both too lenient on the Confederates and not going far enough to help former slaves who had been freed during or after the Civil War by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment After the war's end and Lincoln's assassination, the Radicals clashed with Andrew Johnson over Reconstruction policy Radicals led efforts after the war to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement

They opposed allowing ex-Confederate officers to retake political power in the Southern U.S., and emphasized liberty, equality, and the Fifteenth Amendment which provided voting rights for the freedmen Many later became Stalwarts, who supported machine politics.\n\n\n20th century\nThe dawn on the 20th century saw the Republican party split into an Old Right and a moderate-liberal faction in the Northeast that eventually became known as Rockefeller Republicans Opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal saw the formation of the conservative coalition [83] The 1950s saw fusionism of traditionalist and social conservatism and right-libertarianism, [216] along with the rise of the First New Right to be followed in 1964 with a more populist Second New Right [217] The rise of the Reagan coalition via the \"Reagan Revolution\" in the 1980s began what has been called the Reagan era Reagan's rise displaced the liberal-moderate faction of the GOP and established Reagan-style conservatism as the prevailing ideological faction of the Party for the next thirty years, until the rise of the right-wing populist faction [9] [23]\n\n\n21st century\nRepublicans began the 21st century with the election of George W Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election and saw the peak of a neoconservative faction that held significant influence over the initial American response to the September 11 attacks through the War on Terror [218] The election of Barack Obama saw the formation of the Tea Party movement in 2009 that coincided with a global rise in right-wing populist movements from the 2010s to 2020's [219]\n\n\nConservatives\nRonald Reagan's presidential election in 1980 established Reagan-style American conservatism as the dominant ideological faction of the Republican Party until the election of Donald Trump in 2016 [9] [22] [13] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] Trump's election split both the GOP and larger conservative movement into Trumpist and anti-Trump factions [230] [231] The party has since undergone a major decrease in the influence of its establishment conservative faction [22] [13] [232] [24] The party has also lost majority support from white voters with college degrees, while continuing to gain among white voters without college degrees [32] [33]\n\n\nChristian right\nSince the rise of the Christian right in the 1970s, the Republican Party has drawn significant support from evangelicals, Mormons, [250] and traditionalist Catholics, partly due to opposition to abortion after Roe v Wade [251] The Christian right faction is characterized by strong support of socially conservative and Christian nationalist policies [c] Christian conservatives seek to use the teachings of Christianity to influence law and public policy [264] Compared to other Republicans, the socially conservative Christian right faction of the party is more likely to oppose LGBT rights, marijuana legalization, and support significantly restricting the legality of abortion [265]\n\n\nLibertarians\nThe Republican Party has a prominent right-libertarian faction [12] [246] This faction of the party tends to prevail in the Midwestern and Western United States [246] Right-libertarianism emerged from fusionism in the 1950s and 60s [270] Barry Goldwater had a substantial impact on the conservative-libertarian movement of the 1960s [271] Compared to other Republicans, they are more likely to favor the legalization of marijuana, LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage, gun rights, oppose mass surveillance, and support reforms to current laws surrounding civil asset forfeiture Right-wing libertarians are strongly divided on the subject of abortion [272] Prominent libertarian conservatives within the Republican Party include Rand Paul, a U.S senator from Kentucky, [273] [274] Kentucky's 4th congressional district congressman Thomas Massie, [275] Utah senator Mike Lee [276] [273] and Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis [277]\n\n\nModerates\nModerates in the Republican Party are an ideologically centrist group that predominantly come from the Northeastern United States, [278] and are typically located in swing states or blue states Moderate Republican voters are typically highly educated, [279] affluent, fiscally conservative, socially moderate or liberal and often Never Trump [246] [278] While they sometimes share the economic views of other Republicans (i.e lower taxes, deregulation, and welfare reform), moderate Republicans differ in that some are for affirmative action, [280] LGBT rights and same-sex marriage, legal access to and even public funding for abortion, gun control laws, more environmental regulation and action on climate change, fewer restrictions on immigration and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants [281] In the 21st century, some former Republican moderates have switched to the Democratic Party [282] [283] [284]\n\n\nRight-wing populists\nRight-wing populism is the dominant political faction of the GOP [d] Sometimes referred to as the MAGA or \"America First\" movement, [301] [302] Republican populists have been described as consisting of a range of right-wing ideologies including but not limited to right-wing populism, [152] [303] [304] national conservatism, [305] neo-nationalism, [306] and Trumpism [294] [307] [308] They have been described as the American political variant of the far-right [e] The election of Trump in 2016 split the party into pro-Trump and anti-Trump factions [230] [231]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDefunct\n\n\nEconomic policies\nRepublicans believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity [355] Reduction in income taxes is a core component of Republicans' fiscal agenda [356]\n\n\nTaxes\nTax cuts have been at the core of Republican economic policy since 1980 [357] At the national level and state level, Republicans tend to pursue policies of tax cuts and deregulation [358] Modern Republicans advocate the theory of supply-side economics, which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth [359] Many Republicans oppose higher tax rates for higher earners, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending Republican lawmakers have also sought to limit funding for tax enforcement and tax collection [360]\n\n\nSpending\nRepublicans frequently advocate in favor of fiscal conservatism during Democratic administrations; however, the party has a record of increasing federal debt during periods when it controls the government (the implementation of the Bush tax cuts, Medicare Part D and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are examples of this record) [366] [367] [368] Republican administrations have, since the late 1960s, sustained or increased previous levels of government spending [369] [370]\n\n\nEntitlements\nRepublicans believe individuals should take responsibility for their own circumstances They also believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor through charity than the government is through welfare programs and that social assistance programs often cause government dependency [371] As of November 2022, all 11 states that had not expanded Medicaid had Republican-controlled state legislatures [372]\n\n\nLabor unions and the minimum wage\nThe Republican Party is generally opposed to labor unions [373] [374] Republicans believe corporations should be able to establish their own employment practices, including benefits and wages, with the free market deciding the price of work Since the 1920s, Republicans have generally been opposed by labor union organizations and members At the national level, Republicans supported the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, which gives workers the right not to participate in unions Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various right-to-work laws [f] [citation needed]\n\n\nTrade\nThe Republican Party has taken widely varying views on international trade throughout its history The official Republican Party platform adopted in 2024 opposes free trade and supports enacting tariffs on imports, though it supports maintaining existing free trade agreements [378] At its inception, the Republican Party supported protective tariffs, with the Morrill Tariff being implemented during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln [379] [377] In the 1896 presidential election, Republican presidential candidate William McKinley campaigned heavily on high tariffs, having been the creator and namesake for the McKinley Tariff of 1890 [72]\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nHistorically, progressive leaders in the Republican Party supported environmental protection Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the National Park Service [397] While Republican President Richard Nixon was not an environmentalist, he signed legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and had a comprehensive environmental program [398] However, this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy [399] Since then, Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation, [400] [401] [402] with many Republicans rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change [399] [403] [404] [405] Republican voters are divided over the human causes of climate change and global warming [406] Since 2008, [407] many members of the Republican Party have been criticized for being anti-environmentalist [408] [409] [410] and promoting climate change denial [411] [412] [413] in opposition to the general scientific consensus, making them unique even among other worldwide conservative parties [413]\n\n\nHealth care\nThe party opposes a single-payer health care system, [429] [430] describing it as socialized medicine It also opposes the Affordable Care Act [431] and expansions of Medicaid [432] Historically, there have been diverse and overlapping views within both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party on the role of government in health care, but the two parties became highly polarized on the topic during 2008–2009 and onwards [433]\n\n\nForeign policy\nThe Republican Party has a persistent history of skepticism and opposition to multilateralism in American foreign policy [440] Neoconservatism, which supports unilateralism and emphasizes the use of force and hawkishness in American foreign policy, has had some influence in all Republican presidential administration since Ronald Reagan's presidency [441] Some, including paleoconservatives, [442] call for non-interventionism and an isolationist \"America First\" foreign policy agenda [34] [241] [242] This faction gained strength starting in 2016 with the rise of Donald Trump, demanding that the United States reset its previous interventionist foreign policy and encourage allies and partners to take greater responsibility for their own defense [443]\n\n\nIsrael\nDuring the 1940s, Republicans predominantly opposed the cause of an independent Jewish state due to the influence of conservatives of the Old Right [444] In 1948, Democratic President Harry Truman became the first world leader to recognize an independent state of Israel, [445] though Truman's pro-Israel stance had the notable support of Robert A Taft, a leading Senate Republican and an early advocate for military support to Israel [446]\n\n\nTaiwan\nIn the party's 2016 platform, [454] its stance on Taiwan is: \"We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island's future must be resolved peacefully, through dialogue, and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan.\" In addition, if \"China were to violate those principles, the United States, in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act, will help Taiwan defend itself\".\n\n\nWar on terror\nSince the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, neoconservatives in the party have supported the War on Terror, including the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War The George W Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants, while other prominent Republicans, such as Ted Cruz, strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which they view as torture [455] In the 2020s, Trumpist Republicans such as Matt Gaetz supported reducing U.S military presence abroad and ending intervention in countries such as Somalia [456]\n\n\nEurope, Russia and Ukraine\nThe 2016 Republican platform eliminated references to giving weapons to Ukraine in its fight with Russia and rebel forces; the removal of this language reportedly resulted from intervention from staffers to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump [457] However, the Trump administration approved a new sale of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine in 2017 [458] Republicans generally question European NATO members' insufficient investment in defense funding, and some are dissatisfied with U.S aid to Ukraine [459] [460] Some Republican members of the U.S Congress support foreign aid to Israel but not to Ukraine, [325] [326] and are accused by U.S media of being pro-Russian [246] [327] [328] [329] [330] [331] [332]\n\n\nForeign relations and aid\nIn a 2014 poll, 59% of Republicans favored doing less abroad and focusing on the country's own problems instead [471]\n\n\nSocial issues\nThe Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies, although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions The social conservatives support laws that uphold their traditional values, such as opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and marijuana [476] The Republican Party's positions on social and cultural issues are in part a reflection of the influential role that the Christian right has had in the party since the 1970s [477] [478] [479] Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control, affirmative action, and illegal immigration [476] [480]\n\n\nAbortion and embryonic stem cell research\nThe Republican position on abortion has changed significantly over time [251] [481] During the 1960s and early 1970s, opposition to abortion was concentrated among members of the political left and the Democratic Party; most liberal Catholics — which tended to vote for the Democratic Party — opposed expanding abortion access while most conservative evangelical Protestants supported it [481]\n\n\nAffirmative action\nRepublicans generally oppose affirmative action, often describing it as a \"quota system\" and believing that it is not meritocratic and is counter-productive socially by only further promoting discrimination According to a 2023 ABC poll, a majority of Americans (52%) and 75% of Republicans supported the Supreme Court's decision in Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard prohibiting race as a factor in college admissions, compared to only 26% of Democrats [501]\n\n\nGun ownership\nRepublicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 45% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents personally own firearms, compared to 32% for the general public and 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents [507]\n\n\nDrug legalization\nRepublican elected officials have historically supported the War on Drugs They generally oppose legalization or decriminalization of drugs such as marijuana [513] [514] [515]\n\n\nImmigration\nThe Republican Party has taken widely varying views on immigration throughout its history [9] In the period between 1850 and 1870, the Republican Party was more opposed to immigration than the Democrats The GOP's opposition was, in part, caused by its reliance on the support of anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant parties such as the Know-Nothings In the decades following the Civil War, the Republican Party grew more supportive of immigration, as it represented manufacturers in the northeast (who wanted additional labor); during this period, the Democratic Party came to be seen as the party of labor (which wanted fewer laborers with which to compete) Starting in the 1970s, the parties switched places again, as the Democrats grew more supportive of immigration than Republicans [519]\n\n\nLGBT issues\nSimilar to the Democratic Party, the Republican position on LGBT rights has changed significantly over time, with continuously increasing support among both parties on the issue [528] [529] The Log Cabin Republicans is a group within the Republican Party that represents LGBT conservatives and allies and advocates for LGBT rights [530] [531]\n\n\nVoting rights\nVirtually all restrictions on voting have in recent years been implemented by Republicans Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as the purging of voter rolls, limiting voting locations, and limiting early and mail-in voting) are vital to prevent voter fraud, saying that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections Polling has found majority support for early voting, automatic voter registration and voter ID laws among the general population [574] [575] [576]\n\n\nComposition\nAccording to a 2015 Gallup poll, 25% of Americans identify as Republican and 16% identify as leaning Republican In comparison, 30% identify as Democratic and 16% identify as leaning Democratic The Democratic Party has typically held an overall edge in party identification since Gallup began polling on the issue in 1991 [601] In 2016, The New York Times stated that the party was strongest in the South, most of the Midwestern and Mountain States, and Alaska [602]\n\n\nDemographics\nSince 1980, a \"gender gap\" has seen stronger support for the Republican Party among men than among women Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Democrat John Kerry than for Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election [613] In 2006 House races, 43% of women voted Republican while 47% of men did so [614] In the 2010 midterms, the \"gender gap\" was reduced, with women supporting Republican and Democratic candidates equally (49%–49%) [615] [616] Exit polls from the 2012 elections revealed a continued weakness among unmarried women for the GOP, a large and growing portion of the electorate [617] Although women supported Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of 55–44% in 2012, Romney prevailed amongst married women, 53–46% [618] Obama won unmarried women 67–31% [619]\n\n\nGender\nSince 1980, a \"gender gap\" has seen stronger support for the Republican Party among men than among women Unmarried and divorced women were far more likely to vote for Democrat John Kerry than for Republican George W Bush in the 2004 presidential election [613] In 2006 House races, 43% of women voted Republican while 47% of men did so [614] In the 2010 midterms, the \"gender gap\" was reduced, with women supporting Republican and Democratic candidates equally (49%–49%) [615] [616] Exit polls from the 2012 elections revealed a continued weakness among unmarried women for the GOP, a large and growing portion of the electorate [617] Although women supported Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of 55–44% in 2012, Romney prevailed amongst married women, 53–46% [618] Obama won unmarried women 67–31% [619]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Republican Party has steadily increased the percentage of votes it receives from white voters without college degrees since the 1970s, while the educational attainment of the United States has steadily increased [33] [314] White voters without college degrees tend to be more socially conservative and are more likely to live in rural areas [623] [624]\n\n\nEthnicity\nRepublicans have been winning under 15% of the African American vote in national elections since 1980 The party abolished chattel slavery under Abraham Lincoln, defeated the Slave Power, and gave Black people the legal right to vote during Reconstruction in the late 1860s Until the New Deal of the 1930s, Black people supported the Republican Party by large margins [635] Black delegates were a sizable share of southern delegates to the national Republican convention from Reconstruction until the start of the 20th century when their share began to decline [636] Black people shifted in large margins to the Democratic Party in the 1930s, when Black politicians such as Arthur Mitchell and William Dawson supported the New Deal because it would better serve the interest of Black Americans [637] Black voters would become one of the core components of the New Deal coalition In the South, after the Voting Rights Act to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a bipartisan coalition in 1965, Black people were able to vote again and ever since have formed a significant portion (20–50%) of the Democratic vote in that region [638]\n\n\nReligious communities\nReligion has always played a major role for both parties, but in the course of a century, the parties' religious compositions have changed Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960, with Catholics, Jews, and southern Protestants heavily Democratic and northeastern Protestants heavily Republican Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 1980s that undercut the New Deal coalition [662] Voters who attended church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in 2004; those who attended occasionally gave him only 47%; and those who never attended gave him 36% Fifty-nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush, along with 52% of Catholics (even though John Kerry was Catholic) Since 1980, a large majority of evangelicals has voted Republican; 70–80% voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004 and 70% for Republican House candidates in 2006.\n\n\nMembers of the business community\nThe Republican Party has traditionally been a pro-business party It garners major support from a wide variety of industries from the financial sector to small businesses Republicans are 24 percent more likely to be business owners than Democrats [675] Prominent business lobbying groups such as the U.S Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers have traditionally supported Republican candidates and

rock, blues, and country music. The band has a rich history spanning over five decades, with a legacy that continues to inspire and influence music fans around the world.\n\n## History\n\nThe story of Lynyrd Skynyrd began in the early 1960s in Jacksonville, Florida, where the band's original members first met. Allen Collins, a young guitarist, received his first guitar in 1963 and soon formed a band called The Mods, which included J.R Rice and Larry Steele. In 1964, Ronnie Van Zant joined another local band, The Squires, which he later renamed to Us. That year, The Mods and Us competed in a local \"Battle of the Bands\" competition, with Us emerging victorious.\n\nHowever, Van Zant left Us shortly after, and the band's lineup continued to change throughout the 1960s. In the early summer of 1964, bassist Larry Junstrom, drummer Bob Burns, and guitarist Gary Rossington formed a trio called Me, You, and Him. This lineup would eventually become the core of Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\n## Early Years (1963-1973)\n\nThe early years of Lynyrd Skynyrd were marked by frequent lineup changes and a struggle to establish themselves as a professional band. However, the band's unique sound and energetic live performances began to gain attention from local music fans. In 1970, the band won a local music competition called the \"Battle of the Bands\" and was awarded a recording contract with MCA Records.\n\nIn 1972, the band was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper, who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta. Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by MCA Records, and produced their first album. The album, titled (Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd), was released on August 13, 1973, and sold over one million copies, earning a gold disc from the RIAA.\n\nThe album featured the hit song \"Free Bird,\" which received national airplay and eventually reached No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's success marked a turning point for the band, establishing them as a major force in the music industry.\n\n## Peak (1973-1977)\n\nThe success of the band's debut album led to a string of hit singles and albums, cementing their status as one of the leading rock bands of the 1970s. Their follow-up album, Second Helping, was released in 1974 and featured the hit singles \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Don't Ask Me No Questions.\"\n\nThe band's music was a unique blend of Southern rock, blues, and country, with lyrics that often reflected their Southern roots and values. Their live performances were known for their high energy and camaraderie, with the band members often engaging in banter and joking with the audience.\n\n## Plane Crash (1977)\n\nOn October 20, 1977, the band boarded a chartered Convair CV-240 bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they were scheduled to appear at LSU the following night. However, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of Gillsburg, Mississippi. Killed on impact were Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, along with backup singer Cassie Gaines (Steve's older sister), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot John Gray.\n\nThe crash marked a devastating blow to the band and their fans, who were left to mourn the loss of the band's lead singer and several other loved ones. The surviving members of the band were shaken but grateful to have escaped the crash with their lives.\n\n## Hiatus (1977-1987)\n\nFollowing the crash, Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded, with the surviving members going their separate ways. However, the band reunited on one occasion to perform an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\" at Charlie Daniels' Volunteer Jam V in January 1979.\n\n## Return (1987-1995)\n\nIn 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson, and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter.\n\n## Member Changes and Deaths (1996-2019)\n\nEd King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had previously played and recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s.\n\n## Farewell Tour and the Death of Rossington (2018-Present)\n\nOn January 25, 2018, Lynyrd Skynyrd announced their Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour, which started on May 4, 2018. The band's farewell tour was a major production, with a large crew and elaborate stage setup.

{"title": "Cicada", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name is directly from the onomatopoeic Latin cicada [5] [6] [b]\n\n\nTaxonomy and diversity\nThe superfamily Cicadoidea is a sister of the Cercopoidea (the froghoppers) Cicadas are arranged into two families: the Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae The two extant species of the Tettigarctidae include one in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies Cicadettinae, Cicadinae, Derotettiginae, Tibicininae (or Tettigadinae), and Tettigomyiinae [8] they are found on all continents except Antarctica Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada Megapomponia imperatoria; its wingspan is up to about 20 cm (8 in) [9] Cicadas are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature [10]\n\n\nPalaeontology\nFossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Late Triassic The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families The Upper Permian Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China The Upper Triassic Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa [20] This group, though, is currently thought to be more distantly related to Cicadomorpha than previously thought [21]\n\n\nBiology\nCicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males They are characterized by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments, including a seta at the tip [26] The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on the rear of the fore wing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing [11]\n\n\nDescription\nCicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males They are characterized by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments, including a seta at the tip [26] The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on the rear of the fore wing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing [11]\n\n\nTemperature regulation\nDesert cicadas such as Diceroprocta apache are unusual among insects in controlling their temperature by evaporative cooling, analogous to sweating in mammals When their temperature rises above about 39 °C (102 °F), they suck excess sap from the food plants and extrude the excess water through pores in the tergum at a modest cost in energy Such a rapid loss of water can be sustained only by feeding on water-rich xylem sap At lower temperatures, feeding cicadas would normally need to excrete the excess water By evaporative cooling, desert cicadas can reduce their bodily temperature by some 5 °C [32] [33] Some non-desert cicada species such as Magicicada tredecem also cool themselves evaporatively, but less dramatically [34] Conversely, many other cicadas can voluntarily raise their body temperatures as much as 22 °C (40 °F) above ambient temperature [35]\n\n\nSong\nThe \"singing\" of male cicadas is produced principally and in the majority of species using a special structure called a tymbal, a pair of which lies below each side of the anterior abdominal region The structure is buckled by muscular action and, being made of resilin, unbuckles rapidly on muscle relaxation, producing their characteristic sounds Some cicadas, however, have mechanisms for stridulation, sometimes in addition to the tymbals Here, the wings are rubbed over a series of midthoracic ridges In the Chinese species Subpsaltria yangi, both males and females can stridulate [36] The sounds may further be modulated by membranous coverings and by resonant cavities [26]\n\n\nLife cycle\nIn some species of cicadas, the males remain in one location and call to attract females Sometimes, several males aggregate and call in chorus In other species, the males move from place to place, usually with quieter calls, while searching for females The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds [11] After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs [11] Both male and female cicadas die within a few weeks after emerging from the soil Although they have mouthparts and are able to consume some plant liquids for nutrition, the amount eaten is very small and the insects have a natural adult lifespan of less than two months.\n\n\nDiet\nCicada nymphs drink sap from the xylem of various species of trees, including oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple While common folklore indicates that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap using their sucking mouthparts [58] [59]\n\n\nLocomotion\nCicadas, unlike other Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation) [63] They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight, but they do not walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel distances greater than a few centimetres [11]\n\n\nPredators, parasites, and pathogens\nCicadas are commonly eaten by birds and mammals, [64] as well as bats, wasps, mantises, spiders, and robber flies In times of mass emergence of cicadas, various amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds change their foraging habits so as to benefit from the glut Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals such as moles [28] In northern Japan, brown bears prey on final instar nymphs of cicadas during summer by digging up the ground [65] In Australia, cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees, making them drop to the ground, where the cicada hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its

"lang": "en", "article": "**Cicada**\n\nThe cicada is a large, conspicuous insect characterized by its distinctive courtship calls. With a long history of human fascination, cicadas have been featured in literature, art, and mythology since ancient times. These insects have also played important roles in various cultures, serving as a source of food, medicine, and inspiration.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"cicada\" is directly derived from the onomatopoeic Latin word \"cicada,\" which mimics the insect's distinctive sound.\n\n**Taxonomy and Diversity**\n\nThe superfamily Cicadoidea is a sister group to the Cercopoidea (froghoppers). Cicadas are divided into two families: Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae. The Tettigarctidae family includes two extant species, one found in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania. The Cicadidae family is further divided into five subfamilies: Cicadettinae, Cicadinae, Derotettiginae, Tibicininae, and Tettigomyiinae. These subfamilies are found on all continents except Antarctica. The largest species of cicada, the Malaysian emperor cicada (Megapomponia imperatoria), has a wingspan of up to 20 cm (8 in).\n\n**Palaeontology**\n\nFossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Late Triassic. The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families: Dunstaniidae, Mesogereonidae, and Palaeontinidae. The Dunstaniidae family is found in Australia and South Africa, as well as in younger rocks from China. The Mesogereonidae family is also found in Australia and South Africa, but is thought to be more distantly related to Cicadomorpha than previously believed.\n\n**Biology**\n\nCicadas are characterized by their three-jointed tarsi and small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments. They have a distinct sound-producing mechanism, which involves the use of specialized membranes and a tymbal. The tymbal is a pair of structures found on either side of the anterior abdominal region, which is buckled by muscular action to produce sound. Some cicadas also have a mechanism for stridulation, where the wings are rubbed over a series of midthoracic ridges. The sounds produced by cicadas can be modulated by membranous coverings and resonant cavities.\n\n**Temperature Regulation**\n\nDesert cicadas, such as the Diceroprocta apache, are unique in their ability to control their body temperature through evaporative cooling. When their body temperature rises above 39°C (102°F), they can rapidly lose water by sucking excess sap from the food plants and extruding it through pores in the tergum. This rapid loss of water can be sustained only by feeding on water-rich xylem sap. At lower temperatures, feeding cicadas would normally need to excrete excess water. Some non-desert cicada species, such as Magicicada tredecem, also cool themselves evaporatively, but less dramatically.\n\n**Song**\n\nThe \"singing\" of male cicadas is produced primarily using a tymbal. The tymbal is a pair of structures found on either side of the anterior abdominal region, which is buckled by muscular action to produce sound. Some cicadas also have a mechanism for stridulation, where the wings are rubbed over a series of midthoracic ridges. The sounds produced by cicadas can be modulated by membranous coverings and resonant cavities.\n\n**Life Cycle**\n\nIn some species of cicadas, the males remain in one location and call to attract females. In other species, the males move from place to place, usually with quieter calls, while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae family differs from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs. Both male and female cicadas die within a few weeks after emerging from the soil.\n\n**Diet**\n\nCicada nymphs drink sap from the xylem of various species of trees, including oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While common folklore indicates that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap using their sucking mouthparts.\n\n**Locomotion**\n\nCicadas, unlike other Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight, but they do not walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel distances greater than a few centimeters.\n\n**Predators, Parasites, and Pathogens**\n\nCicadas are commonly eaten by birds and mammals. They are also preyed upon by bats, wasps, mantises, spiders, and robber flies. In times of mass emergence of cicadas, various amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds change their foraging habits to benefit from the glut. Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed upon by burrowing mammals such as moles.\n\n**Antipredator Adaptations**\n\nCicadas use a variety of strategies to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. Being colored like tree bark and disruptively patterned to break up their outlines, they are difficult to discern. Their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.\n\n**In Human Culture**\n\nCicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty (1766–1122 BCE). They are described by Aristotle in his History of Animals and by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History.

subfamilies Cicadettinae, Cicadinae, Derotettiginae, Tibicininae (or Tettigadinae), and Tettigomyiinae [8] they are found on all continents except Antarctica Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada Megapomponia imperatoria; its wingspan is up to about 20 cm (8 in) [9] Cicadas are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature [10]\n\n\nPalaeontology\nFossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Late Triassic The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families The Upper

characterized by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments, including a seta at the tip [26] The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on the rear of the fore wing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing [11]\n\n\nDescription\nCicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males They are characterized by

and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing [11]\n\n\nTemperature regulation\nDesert cicadas such as Diceroprocta apache are unusual among insects in controlling their temperature by evaporative cooling, analogous to sweating in mammals When their temperature rises above about 39 °C (102 °F), they suck excess sap from the food plants and extrude the excess water through pores in the tergum at a modest cost in energy Such a rapid loss of water can be sustained only by feeding on water-rich xylem sap At lower temperatures, feeding cicadas would normally need to excrete the excess water By evaporative cooling, desert cicadas can reduce their bodily temperature by some 5 °C [32] [33] Some non-desert cicada species such as Magicicada tredecem also cool themselves evaporatively, but less dramatically [34] Conversely, many other cicadas can voluntarily raise their body temperatures as much as 22 °C (40 °F) above ambient temperature [35]\n\n\nSong\nThe \"singing\" of male cicadas is produced principally and in the majority of species using a special structure called a tymbal, a pair of which lies below each side of the anterior abdominal region The structure is buckled by muscular action and, being made of resilin, unbuckles rapidly on muscle relaxation, producing their characteristic sounds Some cicadas, however, have mechanisms for stridulation, sometimes in addition to the tymbals Here, the wings are rubbed over a series of midthoracic ridges In the Chinese species Subpsaltria yangi, both males and females can stridulate [36] The sounds may further be modulated by membranous coverings and by resonant cavities [26]\n\n\nLife cycle\nIn some species of cicadas, the males remain in one location and call to attract females Sometimes, several males aggregate and call in chorus In other species, the males move from place to place, usually with quieter calls, while searching for females The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds [11] After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs [11] Both male and female cicadas die within a few weeks after emerging from the soil Although they have mouthparts and are able to consume some plant liquids for nutrition, the amount eaten is very small and the insects have a natural adult lifespan of less than two months.\n\n\nDiet\nCicada nymphs drink sap from the xylem of various species of trees, including oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple While common folklore indicates that adults do not eat, they

mammals, and birds change their foraging habits so as to benefit from the glut Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals such as moles [28] In northern Japan, brown bears prey on final instar nymphs of cicadas during summer by digging up the ground [65] In Australia, cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees, making them drop to the ground, where the cicada hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100 m, until they can be shoved down into its burrow, where the numb cicadas are placed onto one of many shelves in a \"catacomb\", to form the food stock for the wasp grub that grows out of the egg deposited there [66] A katydid predator from Australia is capable of attracting singing male cicadas of a variety of species by imitating the timed click replies of sexually receptive female cicadas,

using IVF would Preimplantation risks of the embryo include unintentional epigenetic effects, influence of media which the embryo is cultured on, and undesirable consequences of invasive manipulation of the embryo Often, multiple embryos are transferred to increase the chance of implantation, and if multiple gestations occur, both the surrogate and the embryos face higher risks of complications [10]\n\n\nSurrogate mothers\nGestational surrogates have a smaller chance of having hypertensive disorder during pregnancy compared to mothers pregnant by oocyte donation This is possibly because gestational carriers tend to be healthier and more fertile than women who use oocyte donation Gestational carriers also have low rates of placenta previa / placental abruptions (1.1–7.9%) [11]\n\n\nOutcomes\nAmong gestational surrogacy arrangements, between 19–33% of gestational surrogates will successfully become pregnant from an embryo transfer Of these cases, 30–70% will successfully allow the intended parent(s) to become parent(s) of the resulting child [13]\n\n\nIndications for surrogacy\nOpting for surrogacy is a choice for single men desiring to raise a child from infancy, same sex couples unable or unwilling for pregnancy, or women unable or unwilling to carry children on their own Surrogacy is chosen by women for a number of medical reasons, such as abnormal or absent uterus, either congenitally (also known as Mayer–Rokitansky–Kuster–Hauser syndrome) [14]  or post-hysterectomy [15] Women may have a hysterectomy due to complications in childbirth such as heavy bleeding or a ruptured uterus Medical diseases such as cervical cancer or endometrial cancer can also lead to surgical removal of the uterus [15] Past implantation failures, history of multiple miscarriages, or concurrent severe heart or renal conditions that can make pregnancy harmful may also prompt women to consider surrogacy [16] The biological impossibility of single men and same-sex couples having a baby also may indicate surrogacy as an option [16]\n\n\nGestational surrogacy\nIn gestational surrogacy, the child is not biologically related to the surrogate, who is often referred to as a gestational carrier Instead, the embryo is created via in vitro fertilization (IVF), using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or donors, and is then transferred to the surrogate [17]\n\n\nHistory\nHaving another woman bear a child for a couple to raise, usually with the male half of the couple as the genetic father, has been referenced since the ancient times Babylonian law and custom allowed this practice, and a woman unable to give birth could use the practice to avoid a divorce, which would otherwise be inevitable [20] [21]\n\n\nPsychological concerns\nAnthropological studies of surrogates have shown that surrogates engage in various distancing techniques throughout the surrogate pregnancy so as to ensure that they do not become emotionally attached to the baby [28] [29] [30] Many surrogates intentionally try to foster the development of emotional attachment between the intended mother and the surrogate child [31] Some surrogates describe feeling empowered by the experience [29] [32]\n\n\nSurrogate\nAnthropological studies of surrogates have shown that surrogates engage in various distancing techniques throughout the surrogate pregnancy so as to ensure that they do not become emotionally attached to the baby [28] [29] [30] Many surrogates intentionally try to foster the development of emotional attachment between the intended mother and the surrogate child [31] Some surrogates describe feeling empowered by the experience [29] [32]\n\n\nChild and parents\nA systematic review [34] of 55 studies examining the outcomes for surrogacy for gestational carriers and resulting families showed that there were no major psychological differences in children up to the age of 10 years old that were born from surrogacy compared to those children born from other assisted reproductive technology or those children conceived naturally.\n\n\nLegal issues\nThe legality of surrogacy varies around the world Many countries do not have laws which specifically deal with surrogacy Some countries ban surrogacy outright, while others ban commercial surrogacy but allow altruistic surrogacy (in which the surrogate is not financially compensated) Some countries allow commercial surrogacy, with few restrictions Some jurisdictions extend a ban on surrogacy to international surrogacy In some jurisdictions rules applicable to adoptions apply while others do not regulate the practice.\n\n\nCitizenship\nThe citizenship and legal status of the children resulting from surrogacy arrangements can be problematic The Hague Conference Permanent Bureau identified the question of citizenship of these children as a \"pressing problem\" in the Permanent Bureau 2014 Study (Hague Conference Permanent Bureau, 2014a: 84–94) [48] [49] According to U.S Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, for a child born abroad to be a U.S citizen one or both of the child's genetic parents must be a U.S citizen In other words, the only way for a foreign born surrogate child to acquire U.S citizenship automatically at birth is if they are the biological child of a U.S citizen Furthermore, in some countries, the child will not be a citizen of the country in which they are born because the gestational carrier is not legally the parent of said child This could result in a child being born without citizenship [50]\n\n\nEast Asia\nIn South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, and India, surrogacies are all regulated “through national laws that expressly ban it or explicitly set the parameters for its legality” [51]\n\n\nChina\nParticularly in China, surrogacy operates within a legally gray area Scholars mostly claim that surrogacy incites social instability both for the Chinese Government and the public, such as civil disputes, gender disproportion, crime, and the spread of disease [52] However, no law legislation or enforcement has been published against surrogacy, whether it is a surrogate mother or a connecting third agency, despite the state government's attitude to ban such practice [53]\n\n\nEthical issues\nNumerous ethical questions have been raised with regards to surrogacy They generally stem from concerns relating to social justice, women's rights, child welfare, bioethics, [54] and societal traditional values.\n\n\nGestational carrier\nThose who view surrogacy as a social justice issue argue that it leads to the exploitation of women in developing countries whose wombs are commodified to meet the reproductive needs of the more affluent [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] While opponents of this stance argue that surrogacy provides a much-needed source of revenue for women facing poverty in developing countries, others purport that the lack of legislation in such countries often leads to much of the profit accruing to middlemen and commercial agencies rather than the gestational carriers themselves [55] [56] It has been argued that under laws of countries where surrogacy falls under the umbrella of adoption, commercial surrogacy can be considered problematic as payment for adoption is unethical, but not paying a gestational carrier for her service is a form of exploitation [60] Both opponents and supporters of surrogacy have agreed that implementing international laws on surrogacy can limit the social justice issues that gestational carriers face in transnational surrogacy [61]\n\n\nChild\nThose concerned with the rights of the child in the context of surrogacy reference issues related to identity and parenthood, abandonment and abuse, and child trafficking.\n\n\nTraditional values in Chinese society\nIn China, surrogacy has been argued to contradict traditional Chinese values [52]\n\n\nFinancial aspects\nAccording to the Assisted Human Reproduction Act adopted in 2004, it is prohibited in Canada to compensate a female for acting as a surrogate mother or to advertise the payment of such compensation [66] However, on October 1, 2016, Health Canada announced its intention to update and strengthen the Assisted Human Reproduction Act to regulate the financial aspects of contracts between intended parents and surrogate mothers [66] According to research, surrogate mothers are mostly motivated by their low socioeconomic status or family debt; [12] they are more likely to be forced into surrogacy due to financial pressures In 2020, Section 12 of the Assisted Human Reproduction Act provides for the reimbursement of expenses and monetary compensation to the surrogate mother to alleviate the financial burden associated with surrogacy [66] According to this proposed regulation, the reimbursement of eligible expenses is not obligatory [66] Aiming at emphasizing the voluntary nature of the gesture The proposed regulation provides a non-exhaustive list of different categories of eligible expenses, such as parking fees, travel expenses, caregiver expenses, meals, psychological consultations, etc [66] Additionally, the surrogate mother can be reimbursed for any lost wages during pregnancy if she obtains written confirmation from a qualified physician that the work posed a risk to the pregnancy [66]\n\n\nReligious issues\nDifferent religions take different approaches to surrogacy, often related to their stances on assisted reproductive technology in general.\n\n\nBuddhism\nBuddhist thought is inconclusive on the matter of surrogacy The prominent belief is that Buddhism totally accepts surrogacy since there are no Buddhist teachings suggesting that infertility treatments or surrogacy are immoral [67] This stance is further supported by the common conception that serving as a gestational carrier is an expression of compassion and therefore automatically aligns with Buddhist values [68]\n\n\nChristianity\nThe Catholic Church is opposed to surrogacy, which it views as immoral and incompatible with Biblical texts surrounding topics of birth, marriage, and life [citation needed] Paragraph 2376 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \"Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral.\" [71] Many proponents of this stance express concern that the sanctity of marriage may be compromised by the insertion of a third party into the marriage contract [72] Additionally, the practice of in vitro fertilisation involved in gestational surrogacy is generally viewed as morally impermissible due to its removal of human conception from the act of sexual intercourse [72] Catholics also condemn in vitro fertilisation due to the destruction of embryos that accompanies the frequent practice of discarding, freezing, or donating non-implanted eggs to stem cell research [72] As such, the Catholic Church deems all practices involving in vitro fertilisation, including gestational surrogacy, as morally problematic [citation

\nWhile Hindu scholars have not debated the issue extensively, T C Anand Kumar, an Indian reproductive biologist, argues that there is no conflict between Hinduism and assisted reproduction [73] Others have supported this stance with reference to Hindu faith, including a story in the Bhagavata Purana which suggests the practice of gestational carrier-hood: [67]\n\n\nIslam\nFor Muslims, the Qur'anic injunction that \"their mothers are only those who conceived them and gave birth to them (waladna hum)\" denies the distinction between genetic and gestational mothers, hence complicating notions of lineage within the context of surrogacy, which are central to the Muslim faith [75]\n\n\nJainism\nJain scholars have not debated the issue of surrogacy extensively Nonetheless, the practice of surrogacy is referenced in the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism according to which the embryo of Lord Mahavira was transferred from a Brahmin woman Devananada to the womb of Trishala, the queen of Kshatriya ruler Siddharth, by a divinity named Harinegameshin [76] This account is not present in Digambara Jain texts, however.\n\n\nJudaism\nIn general, there is a lack of consensus within the Jewish community on the matter of surrogacy Jewish scholars and rabbis have long debated this topic, expressing conflicting views on both sides of the debate.\n\n\nFertility tourism\nSome countries, such as the United States, Canada, Greece, Georgia and Mexico are popular surrogacy destinations for foreign intended parents [80] Ukraine, Belarus and Russia were also destinations before the Russian invasion of Ukraine Eligibility, processes and costs differ from country to country Fertility tourism for surrogacy is driven by legal restrictions in the home country or the incentive of lower prices abroad Previously popular destinations, India, Nepal and Thailand have all recently implemented bans on commercial surrogacy for non-residents [81] China is also a famous destination, even though surrogacy is legally banned [2]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Surrogacy**\n\nSurrogacy is a reproductive technology where a woman carries and gives birth to a child for another person or couple. This can be done through traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother's egg is fertilized by the intended father's or a donor's sperm, or gestational surrogacy, where the embryo is created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or donors.\n\n**Methods**\n\n### Traditional Surrogacy\n\nTraditional surrogacy, also known as partial, natural, or straight surrogacy, is a type of surrogacy where the surrogate mother's egg is fertilized by the intended father's or a donor's sperm. This type of surrogacy is less common than gestational surrogacy and is considered to be less legally complex.\n\n### Gestational Surrogacy\n\nGestational surrogacy is a type of surrogacy where the embryo is created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or donors. The embryo is then transferred to the surrogate mother's uterus, where it implants and develops. This type of surrogacy is more common than traditional surrogacy and is considered to be less legally complex.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe embryo implanted in gestational surrogacy faces the same risks as anyone using IVF would. Preimplantation risks of the embryo include unintentional epigenetic effects, influence of media which the embryo is cultured on, and undesirable consequences of invasive manipulation of the embryo.

needed]\n\n\nCatholicism\nThe Catholic Church is opposed to surrogacy, which it views as immoral and incompatible with Biblical texts surrounding topics of birth, marriage, and life [citation needed] Paragraph 2376 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \"Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral.\" [71] Many proponents of this stance express concern that the sanctity of marriage may be compromised by the insertion of a third party into the marriage contract [72] Additionally, the practice of in vitro fertilisation involved in gestational surrogacy is generally viewed as morally impermissible due to its removal of human conception from the act of sexual intercourse [72] Catholics also condemn in vitro fertilisation due to the destruction of embryos that accompanies the frequent practice of discarding, freezing, or donating non-implanted eggs to stem cell research [72] As such, the Catholic Church deems all practices involving in vitro fertilisation, including gestational surrogacy, as morally problematic [citation needed]\n\n\nHinduism\nSurrogacy does not conflict with the Hindu religion [67]  Surrogacy and other scientific methods of assisted reproduction are generally supported within the Hindu community \nWhile Hindu scholars have not debated the issue extensively, T C Anand Kumar, an Indian reproductive biologist, argues that there is no conflict between Hinduism and assisted reproduction [73] Others have supported this stance with reference to Hindu faith, including a story in the Bhagavata Purana which suggests the practice of gestational carrier-hood: [67]\n\n\nIslam\nFor Muslims, the Qur'anic injunction that \"their mothers are only those who conceived them and gave birth to them (waladna hum)\" denies the distinction between genetic and gestational mothers, hence complicating notions of lineage within the context of surrogacy, which are central to the Muslim faith [75]\n\n\nJainism\nJain scholars have not debated the issue of surrogacy extensively Nonetheless, the practice of surrogacy is referenced in the Śvētāmbara tradition of Jainism according to which the embryo of Lord Mahavira was transferred from a Brahmin woman Devananada to the womb of Trishala, the queen of Kshatriya ruler Siddharth, by a divinity named Harinegameshin [76] This account is not present in Digambara Jain texts, however.\n\n\nJudaism\nIn general, there is a lack of consensus within the Jewish community on the matter of surrogacy Jewish scholars and rabbis have long debated this topic, expressing conflicting views on both sides of the debate.\n\n\nFertility tourism\nSome countries, such as the United States, Canada, Greece, Georgia and Mexico are popular surrogacy destinations for foreign intended parents [80] Ukraine, Belarus and Russia were also destinations before the Russian invasion of Ukraine Eligibility, processes and costs differ from country to country Fertility tourism for surrogacy is driven by legal restrictions in the home country or the incentive of lower prices abroad Previously popular destinations, India, Nepal and Thailand have all recently implemented bans on commercial surrogacy for non-residents [81] China is also a famous destination, even though surrogacy is legally banned [2]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Boogaloo_movement", "content": "\nOverview\nThe term boogaloo alludes to the 1984 sequel film Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, which was derided by critics as a derivative rehash [2] [34] Subsequently, appending \"2: Electric Boogaloo\" to a name became a jocular verbal template for any kind of sequel, especially one that strongly mimics the original [2] [34] The boogaloo movement adopted its identity based on the anticipation of a second American Civil War or second American Revolution, which was referred to as \"Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo\" and became popularly known among adherents as \"the boogaloo\" [6] [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nNaming and identity\nThe term boogaloo alludes to the 1984 sequel film Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, which was derided by critics as a derivative rehash [2] [34] Subsequently, appending \"2: Electric Boogaloo\" to a name became a jocular verbal template for any kind of sequel, especially one that strongly mimics the original [2] [34] The boogaloo movement adopted its identity based on the anticipation of a second American Civil War or second American Revolution, which was referred to as \"Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo\" and became popularly known among adherents as \"the boogaloo\" [6] [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nPolitical beliefs\nGroups in the boogaloo movement are far-right, [5] [6] [8] [10] [23] [40] anti-government, and pro-gun [1] [10] Some groups have also been variously described as being alt-right, [41] [42] anarchist, [41] [42] libertarian, [3] [8] [10] [21] [20] [43] or right-libertarian [10] According to Alex Newhouse, a digital researcher at Middlebury's CTEC, \"the way we know the 'boogaloo' movement is a far-right movement is because they draw a line directly from Waco and Ruby Ridge They hold up things like the McVeigh bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building and the armed response to Ruby Ridge as heroic moments in American history\", which they view as citizens standing up to government oppression [20] Newhouse also identified the choice by adherents of the movement to provide armed protection to private businesses during anti-lockdown protests and George Floyd protests as evidence that the movement is right-wing, saying that leftists would not be likely to do the same as they are more likely to view large corporations as an integral component of capitalist exploitation [20] According to Newhouse, this emphasis on the importance of private property is part of what makes the boogaloo movement \"very much an extreme right libertarian ideology\" [20]\n\n\nStructure and membership\nWhile boogaloo groups are often described as a part of a larger boogaloo movement, J J MacNab, a George Washington University fellow researching anti-government extremist groups, has said that she does not agree with this characterization: \"since the majority of participants were radicalized elsewhere prior to donning a Hawaiian shirt—either in anti-government militant groups such as the Three Percenters or the militias, or in white supremacy groups—the Boogaloo shouldn't be considered an independent movement at this time\" [36] Speaking to the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism on July 16, 2020, MacNab testified that the boogaloo movement \"isn't really a movement It's a dress code, it's a way of talking, it's jargon The people who belong to it came from other extremist groups, usually on Facebook They might have been militia, they might have been a white supremacy  [group] They picked it up somewhere and they donned that Hawaiian shirt, and yet they're treated as a separate movement, and the problem is you're ignoring the underlying areas that they came from\" [53] Bellingcat and the SPLC have also stated that other groups with their own distinct identities have adopted the boogaloo meme, including militias, groups comprising the patriot movement, and the Proud Boys [8] [3]\n\n\nHistory\nMemes referring to \"the boogaloo\", a violent uprising or civil war, developed simultaneously among anti-government and white supremacist online communities in the early 2010s According to the SPLC, both types of communities regularly used the term to refer to racist violence or a race war [3] Researchers at Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) and the Middlebury's CTEC both traced the origins of the boogaloo meme and the later movement based around it in part to the imageboard website 4chan, where the meme was often accompanied by references to \"racewar\" and \"dotr\" (day of the rope, a neo-Nazi reference to a fantasy involving murdering what the posters view to be \"race traitors\") [1] [48] On /k/, 4chan's board devoted to discussing weapons, the term was found in posts tracing at least back to 2012 [7] [8] [3] According to Bellingcat researchers, users of /k/ overlap with those of the political discussion board /pol/, where \"militant white nationalism\" is the \"default ideological position\" [7] Although the researchers do not consider the /k/ board to be white nationalist, and the community actively discourages political discussion, they note racist content is commonplace [8] CTEC researchers attribute the growth of the movement to the /k/ board, but write that the meme itself also \"grew organically on the racist board /pol/, due to significant user overlap between the two communities\" [7] [3] The boogaloo meme migrated to other online communities and the SPLC wrote that boogaloo was a \"well-established meme in some of the most violently racist spaces on the internet\" by 2015 They traced usage of the meme back to 2013 on the now-defunct Iron March website, a fascist and neo-Nazi web forum known as the birthplace of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi terrorist organization [7]\n\n\nEmergence\nMemes referring to \"the boogaloo\", a violent uprising or civil war, developed simultaneously among anti-government and white supremacist online communities in the early 2010s According to the SPLC, both types of communities regularly used the term to refer to racist violence or a race war [3] Researchers at Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) and the Middlebury's CTEC both traced the origins of the boogaloo meme and the later movement based around it in part to the imageboard website 4chan, where the meme was often

and neo-Nazi web forum known as the birthplace of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi terrorist organization [7]\n\n\nShooting of Duncan Lemp\nOn March 12, 2020, Duncan Lemp, a boogaloo Facebook group leader, was fatally shot by police in a no-knock raid of his home in Potomac, Maryland Police had obtained a no-knock search warrant based on a tip that Lemp was violating a restriction from possessing firearms However, Lemp's family has said they were unaware that he was under any such restriction [59] Lemp's family has also asserted that he was asleep when he was killed by police [60] Some far-right groups have theorized that Lemp was killed by police for his anti-government beliefs and his position in the boogaloo movement [27] J J MacNab, a fellow of the George Washington University extremism program, has described Lemp as a \"martyr\" of the boogaloo movement and warned that the increase in anti-police sentiment among boogaloo group members following his death may lead to violence against the police in the \"foreseeable future\" [4] Some adherents of the boogaloo movement use phrases including \"we are Duncan Lemp\" and \"his name was Duncan Lemp\", which The New York Times has said they \"repeat.. like mantras\" [16] Adherents of the boogaloo have posted to Lemp's girlfriend's Instagram account promising to someday avenge his death [16]\n\n\nOffline activities\nAdherents of the boogaloo movement have been observed at pro-gun rights demonstrations, protests against COVID-19 lockdowns, and the George Floyd protests which began in May 2020 and continued through the year [1] [4] [33] Believers in the movement can also appear unexpectedly at events and protests initiated by others with apparently different affiliations [10] [33] [44]\n\n\nGeorge Floyd protests\nSome members of boogaloo groups attended the protests that occurred across the United States beginning in May 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd [21] [22] On July 25, 2020, 28-year old Black Lives Matter protester Garrett Foster, who identified with the boogaloo movement and had expressed anti-racist, libertarian, and anti-police views, was shot and killed in an altercation with a motorist accelerating their vehicle into a crowd of protesters [64] According to Vice, although the boogaloo groups tried to position themselves as allies of the Black Lives Matter movement, they generally avoided addressing police brutality in the United States as a racial issue [21] Extremism researcher Robert Futrell spoke of the varied motivations of the adherents of the boogaloo movement who attended the protests, saying: \"Some folks who identify as Boogaloo Bois share anti-police sentiments Some are acting as self-appointed security, vowing to protect businesses from protesters Some say they're monitoring the protests Some are white supremacists trying to antagonize protesters\" [11] Posts in some online boogaloo groups called for their members to loot police stations and set fire to government buildings while some encouraged actions emulating the \"rooftop Koreans\", a reference to Korean store owners who shot at looters from roofs during the 1992 Los Angeles riots [40] There were a number of criminal incidents related to boogaloo adherents attending the George Floyd protests as well as the murders of a security contractor and a police officer believed to have been committed by two men associated with the boogaloo movement who used the protests as a distraction to commit their attacks [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nOnline activities\nGroups belonging to the boogaloo movement organize on mainstream online platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, in chat rooms on Discord and Telegram, and on more obscure platforms such as 4chan [1] [35] [54] [33] Online extremism researcher Megan Squire observed references to the boogaloo in white supremacist Telegram chat rooms in the summer of 2019, before the movement began to become popular on gun forums in September of the same year [11] Vice has also noted the boogaloo meme was popular on the TikTok video sharing application, where the #Boogaloo hashtag had over two million views as of June 2020 [update], although many posters are not believed to be serious adherents of the movement [68]\n\n\nCriminality and violence\n\nPeople affiliated with the boogaloo movement have been arrested and five deaths have been publicly linked to boogaloo rhetoric [20] [31] Some of the charges against people affiliated with the movement include murder, [69] conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, possession of unregistered firearms, [65] making a terroristic threat against a peace officer, [27] inciting a riot, aggravated breach of peace, and drugs charges [66] [70]\n\n\nMurders of police and security officers in California\nUnited States Air Force sergeant Steven Carrillo was charged with the June 6, 2020 murder of a Santa Cruz County deputy and the May 29 murder of a Federal Protective Service officer in Oakland At the time of the attacks, Carrillo was an active-duty member of an elite Air Force unit tasked with guarding American military personnel at unsecure foreign airfields [67] Carrillo wrote \"Boog\" and the phrases \"I became unreasonable\" (a popular meme among boogaloo groups) and \"Stop the duopoly\" in his own blood on the hood of a vehicle he hijacked A patch with a boogaloo symbol and a ballistic vest bearing the boogaloo symbol of an American flag with an igloo instead of stars were also found in the white van allegedly used in the murders [69] [71]\n\n\nPlot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\nOn October 8, 2020, a federal indictment against six men associated with the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based militia group, was unsealed The indictment charges the men with plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and violently overthrow the state government [73] The FBI became aware of the scheme in early 2020 after communications among the far-right group were discovered, and via an undercover agent who met with more than a dozen individuals at a meeting in Dublin, Ohio [74] Another seven men were charged with state crimes in relation to the plot [75]\n\n\nActs during George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests\nThree boogaloo movement members pleaded guilty to federal charges in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis that occurred in late May 2020 As riots broke out after the murder of George Floyd on May 25, Michael Robert Solomon of New Brighton, Minnesota, recruited boogaloo movement members to participate with the hopes that chaos would lead to a civil war and would be blamed on the Black Lives Matter movement [77] Benjamin Ryan Teeter of Hampstead, North Carolina, and Ivan Harrison Hunter of Boerne, Texas, were among those who traveled to Minneapolis to participate in the unrest [78] [79] After the riots abated, boogaloo adherents attempted to raise money to buy a training facility in South America Solomon and Teeter connected with an FBI informant who had posed as a member of the Hamas organization, who they agreed to supply weapons to, and they also made plans to bomb a courthouse in the Twin Cities metropolitan area Solomon and Teeter were arrested by federal agents in September 2020 before their plans were carried out [78] The two pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges, Teeter in December 2020 and Solomon in May 2021, and faced potential prison sentences of up to 20 years [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nOther incidents\nOn November 23, 2019, a police officer approached the Mahopac, New York, home of a 28-year-old Afghanistan War veteran, to investigate an accusation of domestic violence When the man refused to come out, police set up a cordon around his home The man began streaming the events on his gun-themed Instagram account, where he used the username \"Whiskey Warrior 556\" The man, who was wearing body armor and armed with a knife, believed police had arrived to confiscate a 30-round magazine under his state's red flag laws [1] [93] During the standoff, he began livestreaming on Instagram, referencing the boogaloo and posting memes [2] He gained over 100,000 followers during the incident, some of whom urged him not to surrender to police One follower with a large following of his own encouraged others to travel to the town and \"shoot traitors\" The man's own posts became increasingly threatening, but he surrendered to police after a seven-hour standoff He was arrested on charges related to the domestic violence accusation The county sheriff's office denied the man's claims that the arrest was related to weapons and reported that officers had found no firearms or magazines in the home [1] [93] The event was later identified as the cause of a large spike in boogaloo-related comments on the 4chan /pol/ board as well as on other boogaloo sites and right-wing militia social media pages, where followers had organized during the incident to disrupt police by bombarding them with phone calls and posted incitements of violence [2]\n\n\nParticipation in the January 6 United States Capitol attack\nSupporters of the boogaloo movement participated in the January 6, 2021, U.S Capitol attack [29] Some wore emblematic gear or symbols [100] A follower said several groups under his command helped storm the Capitol, taking the opportunity to strike against the federal government [101] Rioters also echoed boogaloo themes and used related terminology to express their readiness for \"the boogaloo\" [102] Steven Daniel Thurlow, 50, of St Clair Shores, Michigan, a Boogaloo member who wore military-style gear with a \"Boogaloo\" patch before participating in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, pleaded guilty in May 2022 to storming the Capitol [103] [104]\n\n\nReactions\nFederal law enforcement agencies and supporting organizations have issued statements warning of the possibility of violence related to the boogaloo movement In April 2020, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) published a Threat Awareness Message about the movement and the potential danger it posed to police and government entities [55] [56]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and government\nFederal law enforcement agencies and supporting organizations have issued

movement and the potential danger it posed to police and government entities [55] [56]\n\n\nThreats related to 2020–2021 racial unrest\nA May 29, 2020, memo published by the DHS warned officers of an extremist white supremacist Telegram channel encouraging its members to commit acts of violence and inciting them to \"start the 'boogaloo'\" during the George Floyd protests [107] Following the filing of terrorism charges against three Nevada men who had allegedly planned to incite a riot at the protests, the NCIS published a report on June 4 warning that boogaloo adherents had discussed recruiting former or active-duty military servicemen and they could not \"discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement.\" [55] On June 15, 2020, the Trump administration issued a warning to police and public safety organizations that adherents of the boogaloo movement might target Washington, D.C The National Capital Region Threat Intelligence Consortium, a fusion center that aids the DHS and other federal national security and law enforcement groups, wrote, \"the District  [of Columbia] is likely an attractive target for violent adherents of the boogaloo ideology due to the significant presence of US law enforcement entities, and the wide range of First Amendment-Protected events hosted here\" The report also warned that adherents may live in D.C or may be prepared to travel long distances to D.C \"to incite civil unrest or conduct violence encouraged in online forums associated with the movement\" On June 19, the DHS published an intelligence report that drew a similar conclusion and stated that \"domestic terrorists advocating for the boogaloo very likely will take advantage of any regional or national situation involving heightened fear and tensions to promote their violent extremist ideology and call supporters to action\" [45] [108]\n\n\nSocial media platforms\n\nOn May 1, 2020, Facebook amended its policy on violence and incitement to prohibit boogaloo and similar terms \"when used with images or statements depicting armed violence\" [32] On June 5, 2020, Facebook told Reuters that it would make it harder to find groups associated with the boogaloo movement by no longer recommending such groups to members of similar associations [114] Facebook also told The Verge that it would be demoting boogaloo-related content in search results [32] On June 30, 2020, Facebook announced that it had removed a network of 220 boogaloo groups and 95 Instagram accounts as well as over 400 other groups that hosted similar content [9] [115] [116] Writing for CNBC, journalist Salvador Rodriguez observed that the removals occurred amidst a Facebook boycott in which companies including Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Volkswagen announced they would no longer advertise on the platform due to \"the hate speech and misinformation that persists on Facebook\" [117] Paid advertisements for body armor and other products using boogaloo keywords ran on Facebook and Instagram for several months prior to the removals [118]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en",

been variously described as being alt-right, [41] [42] anarchist, [41] [42] libertarian, [3] [8] [10] [21] [20] [43] or right-libertarian [10] According to Alex Newhouse, a digital researcher at

Oklahoma City federal building and the armed response to Ruby Ridge as heroic moments in American history\", which they view as citizens standing up to government oppression [20] Newhouse also identified the choice by adherents of the movement to provide armed protection to private businesses during anti-lockdown protests and George Floyd protests as evidence that the movement is right-wing, saying that leftists would not be likely to do the same as they are more likely to view large corporations as an integral component of capitalist exploitation [20] According to Newhouse, this emphasis on the importance of private property is part of what makes the boogaloo movement \"very much an extreme right libertarian ideology\" [20]\n\n\nStructure and membership\nWhile boogaloo groups are often described as a part of a larger boogaloo movement, J J MacNab, a George Washington University fellow researching anti-government extremist groups, has said that she does not agree with this characterization: \"since the majority of participants were radicalized elsewhere prior to donning a Hawaiian shirt—either in anti-government militant groups such as the Three Percenters or the militias, or in white supremacy groups—the Boogaloo shouldn't be considered an independent movement at this time\" [36] Speaking to the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism on July 16, 2020, MacNab testified that the boogaloo movement \"isn't really a movement It's a dress code, it's a way of talking, it's jargon The people who belong to

own distinct identities have adopted the boogaloo meme, including militias, groups comprising the patriot movement, and the Proud Boys [8] [3]\n\n\nHistory\nMemes referring to \"the boogaloo\", a violent uprising or civil war, developed simultaneously among anti-government and white supremacist online communities in the early 2010s According to the SPLC, both types of communities regularly used the term to refer to racist violence or a race war [3] Researchers at Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) and the Middlebury's CTEC both traced the origins of the boogaloo meme and the later movement based around it in part to the imageboard website 4chan, where the meme was often accompanied by references to \"racewar\" and \"dotr\" (day of the rope, a neo-Nazi reference to a fantasy involving murdering what the posters view to be \"race traitors\") [1] [48] On /k/, 4chan's board devoted to discussing weapons, the term was found in posts tracing at least back to 2012 [7]

Although the researchers do not consider the /k/ board to be white nationalist, and the community actively discourages political discussion, they note racist content is commonplace [8] CTEC researchers attribute the growth of the movement to the /k/ board, but write that the meme itself also \"grew organically on the racist board /pol/, due to significant user overlap between the two communities\" [7] [3] The boogaloo meme migrated to other online communities and the SPLC wrote that boogaloo was a \"well-established meme in some of the most violently racist spaces on the

\"repeat.. like mantras\" [16] Adherents of the boogaloo have posted to Lemp's girlfriend's Instagram account promising to someday avenge his death [16]\n\n\nOffline activities\nAdherents of the boogaloo movement have been observed at pro-gun rights demonstrations, protests against COVID-19 lockdowns, and the George Floyd protests which began in May 2020 and continued through the year [1] [4] [33] Believers in the movement can also appear unexpectedly at events and protests initiated by others with apparently different affiliations [10] [33] [44]\n\n\nGeorge Floyd protests\nSome members of boogaloo groups attended the protests that occurred across the United States beginning in May 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd [21] [22] On July 25, 2020, 28-year old Black Lives Matter protester Garrett Foster, who identified with the boogaloo movement and had expressed anti-racist, libertarian, and anti-police views, was shot and killed in an altercation with a motorist accelerating their vehicle into a crowd of protesters [64] According to Vice, although the boogaloo groups tried to position themselves as allies of the Black Lives Matter movement, they generally avoided addressing police brutality in the United States as a racial issue [21] Extremism researcher Robert Futrell spoke of the varied motivations of the adherents of the boogaloo movement who attended the protests, saying: \"Some folks who identify as Boogaloo Bois share anti-police sentiments Some are acting as self-appointed security, vowing to protect businesses from protesters Some say they're monitoring the protests Some are white supremacists trying to antagonize protesters\" [11] Posts in some online boogaloo groups called for their members to loot police stations and set fire to government buildings while some encouraged actions emulating the \"rooftop Koreans\", a reference to Korean store owners who shot at looters from roofs during the 1992 Los Angeles riots [40] There were a number of criminal incidents related to boogaloo adherents attending the George Floyd protests as well as the murders of a security contractor and a police officer believed to have been committed by two men associated with the boogaloo movement who used the protests as a distraction to commit their attacks [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nOnline activities\nGroups belonging to the boogaloo movement organize on mainstream online platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, in chat rooms on Discord and Telegram, and on more obscure platforms such as 4chan [1] [35] [54] [33] Online extremism researcher Megan Squire observed references to the boogaloo in white supremacist Telegram chat rooms in the summer of 2019, before the movement began to become popular on gun forums in September of the same year [11] Vice has also noted the boogaloo meme was popular on the TikTok video sharing application, where the #Boogaloo hashtag had over two million views as of June 2020 [update], although many posters are not believed to be serious adherents of the movement [68]\n\n\nCriminality and violence\n\nPeople affiliated with the boogaloo movement have been arrested and five deaths have been publicly linked to boogaloo rhetoric [20] [31] Some of the charges against people affiliated with the movement include murder, [69] conspiracy to damage and destroy by fire and explosive, possession of unregistered firearms, [65] making a terroristic threat against a peace officer, [27] inciting a riot, aggravated breach of peace, and drugs charges [66] [70]\n\n\nMurders of police and security officers in California\nUnited States Air Force sergeant Steven Carrillo was charged with the June 6, 2020 murder of a Santa Cruz County deputy and the May 29 murder of a Federal Protective Service officer in Oakland At the time of the attacks, Carrillo was an active-duty member of an elite Air Force unit tasked with guarding American military personnel at unsecure foreign airfields [67] Carrillo wrote \"Boog\" and the phrases \"I became unreasonable\" (a popular meme among boogaloo groups) and \"Stop the duopoly\" in his own blood on the hood of a vehicle he hijacked A patch with a boogaloo symbol and a ballistic vest bearing the boogaloo symbol of an American flag with an igloo instead of stars were also found in the white van allegedly used in the murders [69] [71]\n\n\nPlot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer\nOn October 8, 2020, a federal indictment against six men associated with the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan-based militia group, was unsealed The indictment charges the men with plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and violently overthrow the state government [73] The FBI became aware of the scheme in early 2020 after communications among the far-right group were discovered, and via an undercover agent who met with more than a dozen individuals at a meeting in Dublin, Ohio [74] Another seven men were charged with state crimes in relation to the plot [75]\n\n\nActs during George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests\nThree boogaloo movement members pleaded guilty to federal charges in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis that occurred in late May 2020 As riots broke out after the murder of George Floyd on May 25, Michael Robert Solomon of New Brighton, Minnesota, recruited boogaloo movement members to participate with the hopes that chaos would lead to a civil war and would be blamed on the Black Lives Matter movement [77] Benjamin Ryan Teeter of Hampstead, North Carolina, and Ivan Harrison Hunter of Boerne, Texas, were among those who traveled to Minneapolis to participate in the unrest [78] [79] After the riots abated, boogaloo adherents attempted to raise money to buy a training facility in South America Solomon and Teeter connected with an FBI informant who had posed as a member of the Hamas organization, who they agreed to supply weapons to, and they also made plans to bomb a courthouse in the Twin Cities metropolitan area Solomon and Teeter were arrested by federal agents in September 2020 before their plans were carried out [78] The two pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges, Teeter in December 2020 and Solomon in May 2021, and faced potential prison sentences of up to 20 years [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nOther incidents\nOn November 23, 2019, a police officer approached the Mahopac, New York, home of a 28-year-old Afghanistan War veteran, to investigate an accusation of domestic violence When the man refused to come out, police set up a cordon around his home The man began streaming the events on his gun-themed Instagram account, where he used the username \"Whiskey Warrior 556\" The man, who was wearing body armor and armed with a knife, believed police had arrived to confiscate a 30-round magazine under his state's red flag laws [1] [93] During the standoff, he began livestreaming on Instagram, referencing the boogaloo and posting memes [2] He gained over 100,000 followers during the incident, some of whom urged him not to surrender to police One follower with a large following of his own encouraged others to travel to the town and \"shoot traitors\" The man's own posts became increasingly threatening, but he surrendered to police after a seven-hour standoff He was arrested on charges related to the domestic violence accusation The county sheriff's office denied the man's claims that the arrest was related to weapons and reported that officers had found no firearms or magazines in the home [1] [93] The event was later identified as the cause of a large spike in boogaloo-related comments on the 4chan /pol/ board as well as on other boogaloo sites and right-wing militia social media pages, where followers had organized during the incident to disrupt police by bombarding them with phone calls and posted incitements of violence [2]\n\n\nParticipation in the January 6 United States Capitol attack\nSupporters of the boogaloo movement participated in the January 6, 2021, U.S Capitol attack [29] Some wore emblematic gear or symbols [100] A follower said several groups under his command helped storm the Capitol, taking the opportunity to strike against the federal government [101] Rioters also echoed boogaloo themes and used related terminology to express their readiness for \"the boogaloo\" [102] Steven Daniel Thurlow, 50, of St Clair Shores, Michigan, a Boogaloo member who wore military-style gear with a \"Boogaloo\" patch before participating in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, pleaded guilty in May 2022 to storming the Capitol [103] [104]\n\n\nReactions\nFederal law enforcement agencies and supporting organizations have issued statements warning of the possibility of violence related to the boogaloo movement In April 2020, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) published a Threat Awareness Message about the movement and the potential danger it posed to police and government entities [55] [56]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and government\nFederal law enforcement agencies and supporting organizations have issued statements warning of the possibility of violence related to the boogaloo movement In April 2020, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) published a Threat Awareness Message about the movement and the potential danger it posed to police and government entities [55] [56]\n\n\nThreats related to 2020–2021 racial unrest\nA May 29, 2020, memo published by the DHS warned officers of an extremist white supremacist Telegram channel encouraging its members to commit acts of violence and inciting them to \"start the 'boogaloo'\" during the George Floyd protests [107] Following the filing of terrorism charges against three Nevada men who had allegedly planned to incite a riot at the protests, the NCIS published a report on June 4 warning that boogaloo adherents had discussed recruiting former or active-duty military servicemen and they could not \"discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement.\" [55] On June 15, 2020, the Trump administration issued a warning to police and public safety organizations that adherents of the boogaloo movement might target Washington, D.C The National Capital Region Threat Intelligence Consortium, a fusion center that aids the DHS and other federal national security and law enforcement groups, wrote, \"the District  [of Columbia] is likely an attractive target for violent adherents of the boogaloo ideology due to the significant presence of US law enforcement entities, and the wide range of First Amendment-Protected events hosted here\" The report also warned that adherents may live in D.C or may be prepared to travel long distances to D.C \"to incite civil unrest or conduct violence encouraged in online forums associated with the movement\" On June 19, the DHS published an intelligence report that drew a similar conclusion and stated that \"domestic terrorists advocating for the boogaloo very likely will take advantage of any regional or national situation involving heightened fear and tensions to promote their violent extremist ideology and call supporters to action\" [45] [108]\n\n\nSocial media platforms\n\nOn May 1, 2020, Facebook amended its policy on violence and incitement to prohibit boogaloo and similar terms \"when used with images or statements depicting armed violence\" [32] On June 5, 2020, Facebook told Reuters that it would make it harder to find groups associated with the boogaloo movement by no longer recommending such groups to members of similar associations [114] Facebook also told The Verge that it would be demoting boogaloo-related content in search results [32] On June 30, 2020, Facebook announced that it had removed a network of 220 boogaloo groups and 95 Instagram accounts as well as over 400 other groups that hosted similar content [9] [115] [116] Writing for CNBC, journalist Salvador Rodriguez observed that the removals occurred amidst a Facebook boycott in which companies including Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and Volkswagen announced they would no longer advertise on the platform due to \"the hate speech and misinformation that persists on Facebook\" [117] Paid advertisements for body armor and other products using boogaloo keywords ran on Facebook and Instagram for several months prior to the removals [118]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Tiger_Woods", "content": "\nBackground and family\nWoods was born on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, [18] to Earl [19] and Kultida \"Tida\" Woods [20] He is their only child, though he has two half-brothers and a half-sister from his father's first marriage [21] Earl was a retired U.S Army officer and Vietnam War veteran Earl was born to African-American parents and was also said to have had European and Native American descent [22] [23] Kultida (née Punsawad) is originally from Thailand, where Earl met her when he was on a tour of duty there in 1968 She is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry [24] In 2002, ESPN claimed: \"For the record, he is one-quarter Thai, one-quarter Chinese, one-quarter African American, one-eighth Caucasian and one-eighth Native American.\" [25] Tiger has described his ethnic make-up as \"Cablinasian\" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian) [26]\n\n\nEarly life and amateur golf career\nWoods grew up in Orange County, California He was a child prodigy who was introduced to golf before the age of two by his athletic father Earl Woods Earl was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer who also was one of the earliest African-American college baseball players at Kansas State University [29] Woods told reporters he had wanted to be a baseball player like his father but abandoned that goal after tearing his rotator cuff [30] His father was a member of the military and had playing privileges at the Navy golf course beside the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, which allowed Tiger to play there Tiger also played at the par 3 Heartwell golf course in Long Beach, as well as some of the municipals in Long Beach [31]\n\n\nCollege golf career\nWoods was heavily recruited by college golf powers He chose Stanford University, the 1994 NCAA champions He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship and won his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H Tucker Invitational, that September [56] He selected a major in economics and was nicknamed \"Urkel\" by college teammate Notah Begay III [57] In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island [49] and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports) [58] [59]\n\n\nProfessional career\nWoods turned professional at age 20 in August 1996 and immediately signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time [64] [65] Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year [66] On April 13, 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest winner at age 21 [67] Two months later, he set the record for the fastest ascent to No 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking [68] After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA Championship, a feat not achieved since Johnny Miller did it in 1974 [69] [70]\n\n\nHonors\nOn August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame He was inducted December 5, 2007 at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento [139] In May 2019, following his 2019 Masters Tournament win, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump [140]\n\n\nEndorsements\nDuring the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most marketable athlete [147] Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he signed endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional athlete at that time [148] Woods's endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a \"start-up\" golf company earlier in the previous decade to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market [147] [149] Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600 million in sales [150] Woods has been described as the \"ultimate endorser\" for Nike Golf, [150] frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products [148] Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls, [147] and has a building named after him at Nike's headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon [151]\n\n\nAccumulated wealth\nWoods has appeared on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes [168] [169] According to Golf Digest, Woods earned $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, [170] and the magazine predicted that Woods would pass a billion dollars in earnings by 2010 [171] In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first professional athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career, after accounting for the $10 million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title [172] The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600 million, making him the second richest person of color in the United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey [173] In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans [174] As of 2017, Woods was considered to be the highest-paid golfer in the world [175] In 2022, Woods was the first golfer to have a net worth over one billion dollars [176]\n\n\nTiger-proofing\nEarly in Woods's career, a small number of golf industry analysts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not) [177] At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\n\n\nCareer achievements\nWoods has won 82 official PGA Tour events, including 15 majors He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as \"the greatest closer in history\" [181] He has the lowest career scoring average and the largest career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.\n\n\nMajor championships\n1Defeated May in three-hole playoff by 1 stroke: Woods (3–4–5=12), May (4–4–5=13) \n2Defeated DiMarco in a

style\nWhen Woods first joined the PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf, [186] but he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years He insisted upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance [187] Many opponents caught up to him, and Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using \"inferior equipment\", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist, or Woods [188] During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, again made him one of the tour's longest players off the tee.\n\n\nOther ventures\nThe TGR Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl as the Tiger Woods Foundation with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children [199] The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships [200] [201] As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people [202] [203]\n\n\nTGR Foundation\nThe TGR Foundation

Born on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, Woods is the only child of Earl and Kultida Woods. His father, a retired U.S. Army officer and Vietnam War veteran, was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer and introduced Tiger to golf at a young age.\n\nBackground and Family\nWoods was born to Earl, a retired U.S. Army officer and Vietnam War veteran, and Kultida, a Thai immigrant. His father was of African-American descent, with European and Native American ancestry, while his mother was of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry. Woods has described his ethnic make-up as \"Cablinasian,\" a term he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian.\n\nEarly Life and Amateur Golf Career\nWoods grew up in Orange County, California, and was a child prodigy who was introduced to golf by his father at a young age. His father was a member of the military and had playing privileges at the Navy golf course in Los Alamitos, which allowed Tiger to play there. Woods also played at the par 3 Heartwell golf course in Long Beach and some of the municipals in Long Beach.\n\nCollege Golf Career\nWoods was heavily recruited by college golf powers and chose Stanford University, the 1994 NCAA champions. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship and won his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H Tucker Invitational, that September. Woods was nicknamed \"Urkel\" by college teammate Notah Begay III and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year.\n\nProfessional Career\nWoods turned professional at age 20 in August 1996 and immediately signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist, which were the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time. Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. On April 13, 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest winner at age 21. Two months later, he set the record for the fastest ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nHonors\nOn August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was inducted on December 5, 2007, at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento. In May 2019, following his 2019 Masters Tournament win, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump.\n\nEndorsements\nDuring the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most marketable athlete. He signed endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional athlete at that time.\n\nAccumulated Wealth\nWoods has appeared on Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes. According to Golf Digest, Woods earned $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007, and the magazine predicted that he would pass a billion dollars in earnings by 2010. In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first professional athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career, after accounting for the $10 million bonus he received for the FedEx Cup title.\n\nTiger-Proofing\nEarly in Woods' career, some golf industry analysts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\n\nCareer Achievements\nWoods has won 82 official PGA Tour events, including 15 majors. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. Multiple golf experts have heralded Woods as \"the greatest closer in history.\" He has the lowest career scoring average and the largest career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.\n\nMajor Championships\nWoods has won 15 major championships, including five Masters titles, four PGA Championships, three U.S. Open titles, and three Open Championships.\n\nWins (15)\n1. 1997 Masters, Augusta National Golf Club\n2. 2000 U.S. Open, Pebble Beach Golf Links\n3. 2000 Open Championship, St Andrews\n4. 2000 PGA Championship, Valhalla Golf Club\n5. 2001 Masters, Augusta National Golf Club\n6. 2002 U.S. Open, Bethpage Black Course\n7. 2002 Open Championship, Muirfield\n8. 2005 Masters, Augusta National Golf Club\n9. 2006 Open Championship, Royal Liverpool Golf Club\n10. 2006 PGA Championship, Medinah Country Club\n11. 2006 U.S. Open, Winged Foot Golf Club\n12. 2007 PGA Championship, Southern Hills Country Club\n13. 2008 U.S. Open, Torrey Pines Golf Course\n14. 2019 Masters, Augusta National Golf Club\n15. 2019 Masters, Augusta National Golf Club\n\nResults Timeline\nWorld Golf Championships\nResults not in chronological order before 2015.\n\nWins (18)\nResults not in chronological order before 2015.\n\nPlaying Style\nWhen Woods first joined the PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf, but he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years. He insisted upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance. Many opponents caught up to him, and Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using \"inferior equipment,\" which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist, or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, again made him one of the tour's longest players off the tee.\n\nOther Ventures\nThe TGR Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl as the Tiger Woods Foundation with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children. The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships.\n\nTGR Foundation\nThe TGR Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl as the Tiger Woods Foundation with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children.

Thunberg shares her second name with the adventuring creation of Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known as Hergé.\" [30] She has a younger sister, Beata [26]\n\n\nActivism\nIn August 2018, Thunberg began the school climate strikes and public speeches for which she has become an internationally recognized climate activist In an interview with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, she said she got the idea of a climate strike after school shootings in the United States in February 2018 led several youths to refuse to return to school [25] These teen activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, went on to organize the March for Our Lives in support of greater gun control [45] [46] In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet In part, she wrote: \"I want to feel safe How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?\" [47]\n\n\nStrike at the Riksdag\nIn August 2018,

newspaper Svenska Dagbladet In part, she wrote: \"I want to feel safe How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?\" [47]\n\n\nSocial media activism\nAfter Thunberg posted a photo of her first strike day on Instagram and Twitter, other social media accounts quickly took up her cause High-profile youth activists amplified her Instagram post, and on the second day, other activists joined her A representative of the Finnish bank Nordea quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters, whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week [51]\n\n\nProtests and speeches in Europe\nThunberg's speech during the plenary session of the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) went viral [65] She said that the world leaders present were \"not mature enough to tell it like it is\" [66] In the first half of 2019, she joined various student protests around Europe, and was invited to speak at various forums and parliaments At the January 2019 World Economic Forum, Thunberg gave a speech in which she declared: \"Our house is on fire.\" [67] She addressed the British, European and French parliaments; in the latter case several right-wing politicians boycotted her [68] [69] In a short meeting with Thunberg, Pope Francis thanked her and encouraged her to continue her activism [70]\n\n\nSabbatical year\nIn August 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth, England, to New York City, in the 60-foot (18 m) racing yacht Malizia II, equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines The trip was announced as a carbon-neutral transatlantic crossing serving as a demonstration of Thunberg's declared beliefs of the importance of reducing emissions [74] The voyage took 15 days, from 14 to 28 August 2019 France 24 reported that several crew members would fly to New York to sail the Malizia II yacht back to Europe [75] On Thunberg's return voyage aboard the La Vagabonde catamaran, she was quoted that she chose sailing as a way to send a message to the world that there is no real sustainable option to travel across the oceans [76] While in New York, Thunberg was invited to give testimony in the US House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis on 18 September Instead of testifying, she gave an eight-sentence statement and submitted the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C as evidence [77]\n\n\nUN Climate Action Summit\n     This is all wrong I shouldn't be up here I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean Yet you all come to us young people for hope How dare you!\n     You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words And yet I'm one of the lucky ones People are suffering People are dying Entire ecosystems are collapsing We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth How dare you!\n\n\nAutumn global climate strikes\nIn late September 2019 Thunberg entered Canada where she participated in climate protests in the cities of Montreal, Edmonton and Vancouver, including leading a climate rally as part of the 27 September 2019 Global Climate Strike in Montreal [86] The school strikes for climate on 20 and 27 September 2019 were attended by over four million people, according to one of the co-organisers [87] Hundreds of thousands took part in the protest, described as the largest in the city's history The mayor of Montreal gave her the Freedom of the City award Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in attendance, and Thunberg spoke briefly with him [88] While in the United States, Thunberg participated in climate protests in New York City with Alexandria Villaseñor and Xiye Bastida, in Washington, D.C., with Jerome Foster II, Iowa City, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Denver with Haven Coleman, and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation with Tokata Iron Eyes In various cities, Thunberg's keynote speech began by acknowledging that she was standing on land that originally belonged to Indigenous peoples, saying: \"In acknowledging the enormous injustices inflicted upon these people, we must also mention the many enslaved and indentured servants whose labour the world still profits from today.\" [89] [90]\n\n\nParticipation at COP25\nThunberg had intended to remain in the Americas to travel overland to attend the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) originally planned in Santiago, Chile, in December However, it was announced on short notice that COP25 was to be moved to Madrid, Spain, because of serious public unrest in Chile [91] Thunberg has refused to fly because of the carbon emissions from air travel, so she posted on social media that she needed a ride across the Atlantic Ocean Riley Whitelum and his wife, Elayna Carausu, two Australians who had been sailing around the world aboard their 48-foot (15 m) catamaran La Vagabonde, offered to take her So on 13 November 2019, Thunberg set sail from Hampton, Virginia, for Lisbon, Portugal Her departing message was the same as it has been since she began her activism: \"My message to the Americans is the same as to everyone – that is to unite behind the science and to act on the science.\" [6] [92] [93]\n\n\nFurther activism in Europe and end of sabbatical year\nOn 30 December 2019, Thunberg was guest editor of the BBC Radio's flagship current affairs programme, the Today Programme [98] Thunberg's edition of the programme featured interviews on climate change with Sir David Attenborough, Bank of England chief Mark Carney, Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja, and Shell Oil executive Maarten Wetselaar The BBC subsequently released a podcast [99] containing these interviews and other highlights On 11 January 2020, Thunberg called on German company Siemens to stop the delivery of railway equipment to the controversial Carmichael coal mine, operated by a subsidiary of Indian company Adani Group in Australia, [100] but on 13 January, Siemens said that it would continue to honour its contract with Adani [101]\n\n\nActivism during the COVID-19 pandemic\nIn early 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused worldwide implementation of mitigation measures, including social distancing, quarantine, and face coverings [109] On 13 March 2020, Thunberg stated that \"In a crisis we change our behavior and adapt to the new circumstances for the greater good of society.\" Thunberg and School Strike for Climate subsequently moved their activities online [110] [111] On 20 August 2020, the second anniversary of Thunberg's first strike, Thunberg and fellow climate activists Luisa Neubauer, Anuna de Wever van der Heyden and Adélaïde Charlier met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin [112] They subsequently announced plans for another global climate strike on 25 September 2020 Neubauer said that whether the strike in September is virtual in nature or in the streets would be determined by the pandemic situation At a joint press conference with fellow activists echoing her sentiment, Neubauer said: \"The climate crisis doesn't pause.\" [113]\n\n\nPost-COVID-19 pandemic\nOn 6 February 2022, Thunberg condemned the British firm Beowulf and its mining of iron on Sámi land She said, \"We believe that the climate, the environment, clean air, water, reindeer herding, indigenous rights and the future of humanity should be prioritized above the short-term profit of a company The Swedish government needs to stop the colonization of Sami.\" [131]\n\n\nPost-high school graduation\nOn 9 June 2023, Thunberg graduated high school and marked the day by attending what would technically be her last school strike for climate protest before receiving her diploma She wore the Swedish traditional graduation white dress and white studentmössa (cap) to the protest She vowed to continue, saying that her \"fight has only just begun.\" [147] [148] In Thunberg's subsequent protest pictures that she posts to her social media accounts, some of the group photos have featured \"School Strike for Climate\" signage.\n\n\nPro-Palestinian activism\nOn 20 October 2023, Thunberg posted a photo during her usual Friday climate protests, showing her and three other protesters holding signs One sign read \"climate justice now\" and the other three displayed support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip amidst the Israel–Hamas war Her post on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram also included fourteen links to \"Palestine solidarity\" social media accounts where, she suggested, \"you can find information on how you can help.\" [164] Thunberg was immediately criticized for not condemning Hamas's attack on Israel [165] The following day Thunberg posted \"It goes without saying – or so I thought – that I'm against the horrific attacks by Hamas As I said, 'the world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected.'\" The Israeli Ministry of Education responded to Thunberg's initial \"statements in support of Gaza without condemning Hamas\" by removing \"various references in the educational curriculum that present Thunberg as a role model and a source of inspiration for youth.\" [166]\n\n\nPosition on climate change\nThunberg asserts that humanity is facing an existential crisis because of global warming [172] and holds the baby boomers, and each subsequent generation, responsible for creating and perpetuating detrimental changes to the Earth's climate [173] She uses graphic analogies (such as \"our house is on fire\") to highlight her concerns and often speaks bluntly to business and political leaders about their failure to take concerted action [174] [175]\n\n\nPublic response and impact\nIn February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by Thunberg's actions and the striking school children in making their voices heard [197] This support from academics, including many scientists, is in sharp contrast with the opposition Thunberg usually receives from politicians, a reflection of the increasing ignorance of environmental science among political circles [198]\n\n\nAcademics\nIn February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by Thunberg's actions and the striking school children in making their voices heard [197] This support from academics, including many scientists, is in sharp contrast with the opposition Thunberg usually receives from politicians, a reflection of the increasing ignorance of environmental science among political circles [198]\n\n\nPoliticians\nThunberg has met with many politicians and world leaders but said she could not think of a single politician who has impressed her Asked about New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who described the climate crisis as a matter of life or death, Thunberg commented, \"It's funny that people believe Jacinda Ardern and people like that are climate leaders That just tells you how little people know about the climate crisis.\" Thunberg says that she ignores words and sentiments: \"Obviously the emissions haven't fallen It goes without saying that these people are not doing anything.\" In fact, New Zealand's greenhouse-gas emissions had increased by 2% in 2019 [26]\n\n\nPress\nIn August 2019, Scott Walsman wrote in Scientific American that Thunberg's detractors have \"launched personal attacks\", \"bash  [her] autism\", and \"increasingly rely on ad hominem attacks to blunt her influence\" [219] Writing in The Guardian, Aditya Chakrabortty said that columnists including Brendan O'Neill, Toby Young, the blog Guido Fawkes, as well as Helen Dale and Rod Liddle at The Spectator and The Sunday Times, had been making \"ugly personal attacks\" on Thunberg [220] British TV presenter Piers Morgan also mocked Thunberg [221] As part of its climate change denial, Germany's right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has attacked Thunberg \"in fairly vicious ways\", according to Jakob Guhl, a researcher for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue [222]\n\n\n\"The Greta effect\"\nIn summarizing Thunberg's global impact on the climate debate, the BBC encapsulated her influence: \"she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people Many commentators call this 'the Greta effect'\" [227]\n\n\nFlight shame\nThunberg has spearheaded the anti-flying movement, promoting rail travel over flying on environmental grounds [240] The buzzword associated with this movement is flygskam or \"flight shame\" [241] [242] It is a phenomenon in which people feel social pressure not to fly because of the rising greenhouse gas emissions of the airline industry It was originally championed by Swedish Olympic athlete Björn Ferry, but has gained significant momentum after Thunberg's refusal to fly on environmental grounds Thunberg backed the campaign to fly less and made it part of her 2019 \"awareness tour\" in Europe [243]\n\n\nX-Site sticker\nIn February 2020, X-Site Energy Services of Alberta, Canada, distributed a sticker with the company's name and an image of a man grabbing the braids of a girl to rape her from behind The girl in the image was labeled \"Greta\" [248] Then 17-year-old Greta Thunberg posted about it on Twitter: \"They are starting to get more and more desperate This shows that we're winning.\" Although the general manager of X-Site initially said that neither X-Site nor any X-Site employee was involved in making the sticker, [249] [250] X-Site Energy later apologized, admitting that they had distributed it and assumed full responsibility The letter asserted that they were destroying known extant copies and making organizational changes to prevent future incidents [251]\n\n\nPublic image and controversies\nAccording to ABC news, in December 2019 Thunberg was attacked by a sitting US president, Donald Trump, after she was named Time's youngest Person of the Year Trump tweeted that \" [Thunberg] must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie Chill Greta, Chill!\" In response, Thunberg changed her Twitter (now X) profile description to read: a \"teenager working on her anger management problem Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.\" [252]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nThunberg has been depicted in popular culture and art [254] Greta and the Giants, a book by Zoë Tucker and Zoe Persico, published by Frances Lincoln Children's Books, was inspired by the life of Thunberg [255] Argentinian artist Andrés Iglesias unveiled an 18-meter mural of Thunberg above Mason street, near Union Square in San Francisco [256] American painter Elizabeth Peyton chose her 2019 portrait Greta Thunberg as the leading image of one of her shows [254] She has been depicted in multiple murals In Bristol, a 15-metre-high (49 ft) mural of Thunberg by artist Jody Thomas, portrays the bottom half of her face as if under rising sea water since May 2019 [257] Thunberg was featured on the Time magazine cover in May 2019 issue, where she was described as a role model [216] and one of the \"Next Generation Leaders\" [258] She and fifteen others were featured on the cover of the fashion magazine Vogue created by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in September 2019 [259]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nThunberg has received honours and awards over the course of her activism In May 2018, before the start of her school strike, she was one of the winners of a climate change essay competition by Svenska Dagbladet (The Swedish Daily News) for young people [47] Thunberg has refused to attend ceremonies or accept prizes if it requires her to fly, such as for the International Children's Peace Prize [273] She has received prizes from various NGOs but also from scientific institutions that lauded her success in raising awareness [274] [275]\n\n\nSpecies named in Thunberg's honour\nThe following species have been described and named after Greta

She spoke about the need for immediate action to address the climate crisis and criticized world leaders for not taking sufficient action. She said: \"How dare you! You have stolen my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\"\n\n**Autumn Global Climate Strikes**\n\nIn late September 2019, Thunberg entered Canada, where she participated in climate protests in the cities of Montreal, Edmonton, and Vancouver, including leading a climate rally as part of the 27 September 2019 Global Climate Strike in Montreal. The school strikes for climate on 20 and 27 September 2019 were attended by over four million people, according to one of the co-organizers. Hundreds of thousands took part in the protest, described as the largest in the city's history.\n\nThe mayor of Montreal gave her the Freedom of the City award. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in attendance, and Thunberg spoke briefly with him. While in the United States, Thunberg participated in climate protests in New York City with Alexandria Villaseñor and Xiye Bastida, in Washington, D.C., with Jerome Foster II, Iowa City, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Denver with Haven Coleman, and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation with Tokata Iron Eyes.\n\n**Participation at COP25**\n\nThunberg had intended to remain in the Americas to travel overland to attend the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) originally planned in Santiago, Chile, in December. However, it was announced on short notice that COP25 was to be moved to Madrid, Spain, because of serious public unrest in Chile. Thunberg has refused to fly because of the carbon emissions from air travel, so she posted on social media that she needed a ride across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nRiley Whitelum and his wife, Elayna Carausu, two Australians who had been sailing around the world aboard their 48-foot (15 m) catamaran La Vagabonde, offered to take her. So on 13 November 2019, Thunberg set sail from Hampton, Virginia, for Lisbon, Portugal. Her departing message was the same as it has been since she began her activism: \"My message to the Americans is the same as to everyone – that is to unite behind the science and to act on the science.\"\n\n**Further Activism in Europe and End of Sabbatical Year**\n\nOn 30 December 2019, Thunberg was guest editor of the BBC Radio's flagship current affairs programme, the Today Programme. Thunberg's edition of the programme featured interviews on climate change with Sir David Attenborough, Bank of England chief Mark Carney, Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja, and Shell Oil executive Maarten Wetselaar.\n\nThe BBC subsequently released a podcast containing these interviews and other highlights. On 11 January 2020, Thunberg called on German company Siemens to stop the delivery of railway equipment to the controversial Carmichael coal mine, operated by a subsidiary of Indian company Adani Group in Australia.\n\nHowever, on 13 January, Siemens said that it would continue to honour its contract with Adani. In early 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused worldwide implementation of mitigation measures, including social distancing, quarantine, and face coverings.\n\n**Activism during the COVID-19 Pandemic**\n\nIn early 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused worldwide implementation of mitigation measures, including social distancing, quarantine, and face coverings. On 13 March 2020, Thunberg stated that \"In a crisis we change our behavior and adapt to the new circumstances for the greater good of society.\" Thunberg and School Strike for Climate subsequently moved their activities online.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Greta_Thunberg\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGreta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg [21] [22] was born on 3 January 2003, in Stockholm, Sweden, [23] [24] to opera singer Malena Ernman and actor Svante Thunberg [25] [26] Her paternal grandfather was actor and director Olof Thunberg [27] [28] [29] As explained by The Week, \"with a thespian father\" and singer mother, \"it is perhaps unsurprising that  [Thunberg] has a slightly unusual name... Thunberg shares her second name with the adventuring creation of Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known as Hergé.\" [30] She has a younger sister, Beata [26]\n\n\nActivism\nIn August 2018, Thunberg began the school climate strikes and public speeches for which she has become an internationally recognized climate activist In an interview with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, she said she got the idea of a climate strike after school shootings in the United States in February 2018 led several youths to refuse to return to school [25] These teen activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, went on to organize the March for Our Lives in support of greater gun control [45] [46] In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet In part, she wrote: \"I want to feel safe How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?\" [47]\n\n\nStrike at the Riksdag\nIn August 2018,

posted a photo of her first strike day on Instagram and Twitter, other social media accounts quickly took up her cause High-profile youth activists amplified her Instagram post, and on the second day, other activists joined her A representative of the Finnish bank Nordea quoted one of Thunberg's tweets to more than 200,000 followers Thunberg's social media profile attracted local reporters, whose stories earned international coverage in little more than a week [51]\n\n\nProtests and speeches in Europe\nThunberg's speech during the plenary session of the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) went viral [65] She said that the world leaders present were \"not mature enough to tell it like it is\" [66] In the first half of 2019, she joined various student protests around Europe, and was invited to speak at various forums and parliaments At the January 2019 World Economic Forum, Thunberg gave a speech in which she declared: \"Our house is on fire.\" [67] She addressed the British, European and French parliaments; in the latter case several right-wing politicians boycotted her [68] [69] In a short meeting with Thunberg, Pope Francis thanked her and encouraged her to continue her activism [70]\n\n\nSabbatical year\nIn August 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth, England, to New York City, in the 60-foot (18 m) racing yacht Malizia II, equipped with solar panels and underwater turbines The trip was announced as a carbon-neutral transatlantic crossing serving as a demonstration of Thunberg's declared beliefs of the importance of reducing emissions [74] The voyage took 15 days, from 14 to 28 August 2019 France 24 reported that several crew members would fly to New York to sail the Malizia II yacht back to Europe [75] On Thunberg's return voyage aboard the La Vagabonde catamaran, she was quoted that she chose sailing as a way to send a message to the world that there is no real sustainable option to travel across the oceans [76] While in New York, Thunberg was invited to give testimony in the US House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis on 18 September Instead of testifying, she gave an eight-sentence statement and submitted the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C as evidence [77]\n\n\nUN Climate Action Summit\n     This is all wrong I shouldn't be up here I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean Yet you all come to us young people for hope How dare you!\n     You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words And yet I'm one of the lucky ones People are suffering People are dying Entire ecosystems are collapsing We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth How dare

and Xiye Bastida, in Washington, D.C., with Jerome Foster II, Iowa City, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Denver with Haven Coleman, and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation with Tokata Iron Eyes In various cities, Thunberg's keynote speech began by acknowledging that she was standing on land that originally belonged to Indigenous peoples, saying: \"In acknowledging the enormous injustices inflicted upon these people, we must also mention the many enslaved and indentured servants whose labour the world still profits from today.\" [89] [90]\n\n\nParticipation at COP25\nThunberg had intended to remain in the Americas to travel overland to attend the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) originally planned in Santiago, Chile, in December However, it was announced on short notice that COP25 was to be moved to Madrid, Spain, because of serious public unrest in Chile [91] Thunberg has refused to fly because of the carbon emissions from air travel, so she posted on social media that

2019, Thunberg was guest editor of the BBC Radio's flagship current affairs programme, the Today Programme [98] Thunberg's edition of the programme featured interviews on climate change with Sir David Attenborough, Bank of England chief Mark Carney, Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja, and Shell Oil executive Maarten Wetselaar The BBC subsequently released a podcast [99] containing these interviews

the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused worldwide implementation of mitigation measures, including social distancing, quarantine, and face coverings [109] On 13 March 2020, Thunberg stated that \"In a crisis we change our behavior and adapt to the new circumstances for the greater good of society.\" Thunberg and School Strike for Climate subsequently moved their activities online [110] [111] On 20 August 2020, the second anniversary of Thunberg's first strike, Thunberg and fellow climate activists Luisa Neubauer, Anuna de Wever van der Heyden and Adélaïde Charlier met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin [112] They subsequently announced plans for another global climate strike on 25 September 2020 Neubauer said that whether the strike in September is virtual in nature or in the streets would be determined by the pandemic situation At a joint press conference with fellow activists echoing her sentiment, Neubauer said: \"The climate crisis doesn't pause.\" [113]\n\n\nPost-COVID-19 pandemic\nOn 6 February 2022, Thunberg condemned the British firm Beowulf and its mining of iron on Sámi land She said, \"We believe that the climate, the environment, clean air, water, reindeer herding, indigenous rights and the future of humanity should be prioritized above the short-term profit of a company The Swedish government needs to stop the colonization of Sami.\" [131]\n\n\nPost-high school graduation\nOn 9 June 2023, Thunberg graduated high school and marked the day by attending what would technically be her last school strike for climate protest before receiving her diploma She wore the Swedish traditional graduation white dress and white studentmössa (cap) to the protest She vowed to continue, saying that her \"fight has only just begun.\" [147] [148] In Thunberg's subsequent protest pictures that she posts to her social media accounts, some of the group photos have featured \"School Strike for Climate\" signage.\n\n\nPro-Palestinian activism\nOn 20 October 2023, Thunberg posted a photo during her usual Friday climate protests, showing her and three other protesters holding signs One sign read \"climate justice now\" and the other three displayed support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip amidst the Israel–Hamas war Her post on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram also included fourteen links to \"Palestine solidarity\" social media accounts where, she suggested, \"you can find information on how you can help.\" [164] Thunberg was immediately criticized for not condemning Hamas's attack on Israel [165] The following day Thunberg posted \"It goes without saying – or so I thought – that I'm against the horrific attacks by Hamas As I said, 'the world needs to speak up and call for an immediate ceasefire, justice and freedom for Palestinians and all civilians affected.'\" The Israeli Ministry of Education responded to Thunberg's initial \"statements in support of Gaza without condemning Hamas\" by removing \"various references in the educational curriculum that present Thunberg as a role model and a source of inspiration for youth.\" [166]\n\n\nPosition on climate change\nThunberg asserts that humanity is facing an existential crisis because of global warming [172] and holds the baby boomers, and each subsequent generation, responsible for creating and perpetuating detrimental changes to the Earth's climate [173] She uses graphic analogies (such as \"our house is on fire\") to highlight her concerns and often speaks bluntly to business and political leaders about their failure to take concerted action [174] [175]\n\n\nPublic response and impact\nIn February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by Thunberg's actions and the striking school children in making their voices heard [197] This support from academics, including many scientists, is in sharp contrast with the opposition Thunberg usually receives from politicians, a reflection of the increasing ignorance of environmental science among political circles [198]\n\n\nAcademics\nIn February 2019, 224 academics signed an open letter of support stating they were inspired by Thunberg's

from politicians, a reflection of the increasing ignorance of environmental science among political circles [198]\n\n\nPoliticians\nThunberg has met with many politicians and world leaders but said she could not think of a single politician who has impressed her Asked about New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who described the climate crisis as a matter of life or death, Thunberg commented, \"It's funny that people believe Jacinda Ardern and people like that are climate leaders That just tells you how little people know about the climate crisis.\" Thunberg says that she ignores words and sentiments: \"Obviously the emissions haven't fallen It goes without saying that these people are not doing anything.\" In fact, New Zealand's greenhouse-gas emissions had increased by 2% in 2019 [26]\n\n\nPress\nIn August 2019, Scott Walsman wrote in Scientific American that Thunberg's detractors have \"launched personal attacks\", \"bash  [her] autism\", and \"increasingly rely on ad hominem attacks to blunt her influence\" [219] Writing in The Guardian, Aditya Chakrabortty said that columnists including Brendan O'Neill, Toby Young, the blog Guido Fawkes, as well as Helen Dale and Rod Liddle at The Spectator and The Sunday Times, had been making \"ugly personal attacks\" on Thunberg [220] British TV presenter Piers Morgan also mocked Thunberg [221] As part of its climate change denial, Germany's right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany (AfD) has attacked Thunberg \"in fairly vicious ways\", according to Jakob Guhl, a researcher for the Institute for Strategic Dialogue [222]\n\n\n\"The Greta effect\"\nIn summarizing Thunberg's global impact on the climate debate, the BBC encapsulated her influence: \"she is credited with raising public awareness of climate change across the world, especially amongst young people Many commentators call this 'the Greta effect'\" [227]\n\n\nFlight shame\nThunberg has spearheaded the anti-flying movement, promoting rail travel over flying on environmental grounds [240] The buzzword associated with this movement is flygskam or \"flight shame\" [241] [242] It is a phenomenon in which people feel social pressure not to fly because of the rising greenhouse gas emissions of the airline industry It was originally championed by Swedish Olympic athlete Björn Ferry, but has gained significant momentum after Thunberg's refusal to fly on environmental grounds Thunberg backed the campaign to fly less and made it part of her 2019 \"awareness tour\" in Europe [243]\n\n\nX-Site sticker\nIn February 2020, X-Site Energy Services of Alberta, Canada, distributed a sticker with the company's name and an image of a man grabbing the braids of a girl to rape her from behind The girl in the image was labeled \"Greta\" [248] Then 17-year-old Greta Thunberg posted about it on Twitter: \"They are starting to get more and more desperate This shows that we're winning.\" Although the general manager of X-Site initially said that neither X-Site nor any X-Site employee was involved in making the sticker, [249] [250] X-Site Energy later apologized, admitting that they had distributed it and assumed full responsibility The letter asserted that they were destroying known extant copies and making organizational changes to prevent future incidents [251]\n\n\nPublic image and controversies\nAccording to ABC news, in December 2019 Thunberg was attacked by a sitting US president, Donald Trump, after she was named Time's youngest Person of the Year Trump tweeted that \" [Thunberg] must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie Chill Greta, Chill!\" In response, Thunberg changed her Twitter (now X) profile description to read: a \"teenager working on her anger management problem Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.\" [252]\n\n\nIn popular culture and art\nThunberg has been depicted in popular culture and art [254] Greta and the Giants, a book by Zoë Tucker and Zoe Persico, published by Frances Lincoln Children's Books, was inspired by the life of Thunberg [255] Argentinian artist Andrés Iglesias unveiled an 18-meter mural of Thunberg above Mason street, near Union Square in San Francisco [256] American painter Elizabeth Peyton chose her 2019 portrait Greta Thunberg as the leading image of one of her shows [254] She has been depicted in multiple murals In Bristol, a 15-metre-high (49 ft) mural of Thunberg by artist Jody Thomas, portrays the bottom half of her face as if under rising sea water since May 2019 [257] Thunberg was featured on the Time magazine cover in May 2019 issue, where she was described as a role model [216] and one of the \"Next Generation Leaders\" [258] She and fifteen others were featured on the cover of the fashion magazine Vogue created by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in September 2019 [259]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nThunberg has received honours and awards over the course of her activism In May 2018, before the start of her school strike, she was one of the winners of a climate change essay competition by Svenska Dagbladet (The Swedish Daily News) for young people [47] Thunberg has refused to attend ceremonies or accept prizes if it requires her to fly, such as for the International Children's Peace Prize [273] She has received prizes from various NGOs but also from scientific institutions that lauded her success in raising awareness [274] [275]\n\n\nSpecies named in Thunberg's honour\nThe following species have been described and named after Greta

Bradbury [6] Gale, an estimated 3.5 to 3.8 billion-year-old impact crater, is hypothesized to have first been gradually filled in by sediments; first water-deposited, and then wind-deposited, possibly until it was completely covered Wind erosion then scoured out the sediments, leaving an isolated 5.5 km (3.4 mi) mountain, Aeolis Mons (\"Mount Sharp\"), at the center of the 154 km (96 mi) wide crater Thus, it is believed that the rover may have the opportunity to study two billion years of Martian history in the sediments exposed in the mountain Additionally, its landing site is near an alluvial fan, which is hypothesized to be the result of a flow of ground water, either before the deposition of the eroded sediments or else in relatively recent geologic history [70]

landing on the Martian surface Curiosity, on the other hand, was active when it touched down on the surface of Mars, employing the rover suspension system for the final set-down [73]\n\n\nTravel status\nAs of August 16, 2024, the rover has driven 32.12 km (19.96 mi) from its landing site over 4255 sols (Martian days) [20]\n\n\nDuplicate testing rovers\nCuriosity has two full sized, vehicle system test beds (VSTB), a twin rover used for testing and problem solving, MAGGIE rover (Mars Automated Giant Gizmo for Integrated Engineering) with a computer brain and a Scarecrow rover without a computer brain They are housed at the JPL Mars Yard for problem solving on simulated Mars terrain [79] [80]\n\n\nScientific instruments\nThe general sample analysis strategy begins with high-resolution cameras to look for features of interest If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition If that signature is intriguing, the rover uses its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nMast Camera (Mastcam)\nThe Mastcam system provides multiple spectra and true-color imaging with two cameras [85] The cameras can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels and up to 10 frames per second hardware-compressed video at 720p (1280×720) [90]\n\n\nChemistry and Camera complex (ChemCam)\nChemCam is a suite of two remote sensing instruments combined as one: a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a Remote Micro Imager (RMI) telescope The ChemCam instrument suite was developed by the French CESR laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory [94] [95] [96] The flight model of the mast unit was delivered from the French CNES to Los Alamos National Laboratory [97] The purpose of the LIBS instrument is to provide elemental compositions of rock and regolith, while the RMI gives ChemCam scientists high-resolution images of the sampling areas of the rocks and regolith that LIBS targets [94] [98] The LIBS instrument can target a rock or regolith sample up to 7 m (23 ft) away, vaporizing a small amount of it with about 50 to 75 5-nanosecond pulses from a 1067 nm infrared laser and then observes the spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock [99]\n\n\nNavigation cameras (Navcams)\nThe rover has two pairs of black and white navigation cameras mounted on the mast to support ground navigation [105] [106] The cameras have a 45° angle of view and use visible light to capture stereoscopic 3-D imagery [106] [107]\n\n\nRover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS)\nREMS comprises instruments to measure the Mars environment: humidity, pressure, temperatures, wind speeds, and ultraviolet radiation [108] It is a meteorological package that includes an ultraviolet sensor provided by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science The investigative team is led by Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Spanish Astrobiology Center and includes the Finnish Meteorological Institute as a partner [109] [110] All sensors are located around three elements: two booms attached to the rover's mast, the Ultraviolet Sensor (UVS) assembly located on the rover top deck, and the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) inside the rover body REMS provides new clues about the Martian general circulation, micro scale weather systems, local hydrological cycle, destructive potential of UV radiation, and subsurface habitability based on ground-atmosphere interaction [109]\n\n\nHazard avoidance cameras (Hazcams)\nThe rover has four pairs of black and white navigation cameras called hazcams, two pairs in the front and two pairs in the back [105] [111] They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and regolith [111] Each camera in a pair is hardlinked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy; only four out of the eight cameras are in use at any one time The cameras use visible light to capture stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) imagery [111] The cameras have a 120° field of view and map the terrain at up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in front of the rover [111] This imagery safeguards against the rover crashing into unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover to make its own safety choices [111]\n\n\nMars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)\nMAHLI is a camera on the rover's robotic arm, and acquires microscopic images of rock and regolith MAHLI can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a resolution as high as 14.5 µm per pixel MAHLI has an 18.3 to 21.3 mm (0.72 to 0.84 in) focal length and a 33.8–38.5° field of view [86] MAHLI has both white and ultraviolet Light-emitting diode (LED) illumination for imaging in darkness or fluorescence imaging MAHLI also has mechanical focusing in a range from infinite to millimeter distances [86] This system can make some images with focus stacking processing [112] MAHLI can store either the raw images or do real time lossless predictive or JPEG compression The calibration target for MAHLI includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a 1909 VDB Lincoln penny, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration [113]\n\n\nAlpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)\nThe APXS instrument irradiates samples with alpha particles and maps the spectra of X-rays that are re-emitted for determining the elemental composition of samples [114] Curiosity's APXS was developed by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) [114] MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA), the Canadian aerospace company that built the Canadarm and RADARSAT, were responsible for the engineering design and building of the APXS The APXS science team includes members from the University of Guelph, the University of New Brunswick, the University of Western Ontario, NASA, the University of California, San Diego and Cornell University [115] The APXS instrument takes advantage of particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and X-ray fluorescence, previously exploited by the Mars Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers [114] [116]\n\n\nChemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin)\nCheMin is the Chemistry and Mineralogy X-ray powder diffraction and fluorescence instrument [118] CheMin is one of four spectrometers It can identify and quantify the abundance of the minerals on Mars It was developed by David Blake at NASA Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, [119] and won the 2013 NASA Government Invention of the year award [120] The rover can drill samples from rocks and the resulting fine powder is poured into the instrument via a sample inlet tube on the top of the vehicle A beam of X-rays is then directed at the powder and the crystal structure of the minerals deflects it at characteristic angles, allowing scientists to identify the minerals being analyzed [121]\n\n\nSample Analysis at Mars (SAM)\nThe SAM instrument suite analyzes organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples It consists of instruments developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Laboratoire atmosphères, milieux, observations spatiales (LATMOS), the Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques (LISA) (jointly operated by France's CNRS and Parisian universities), and Honeybee Robotics, along with many additional external partners [82] [124] [125] The three main instruments are a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS), a gas chromatograph (GC) and a tunable laser spectrometer (TLS) These instruments perform precision measurements of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars in order to distinguish between their geochemical or biological origin [82] [125] [126] [127]\n\n\nDust Removal Tool (DRT)\nThe Dust Removal Tool (DRT) is a motorized, wire-bristle brush on the turret at the end of Curiosity's arm The DRT was first used on a rock target named Ekwir_1 on January 6, 2013 Honeybee Robotics built the DRT [128]\n\n\nRadiation assessment detector (RAD)\nThe role of the Radiation assessment detector (RAD) instrument is to characterize the broad spectrum of radiation environment found inside the spacecraft during the cruise phase and while on Mars These measurements have never been done before from the inside of a spacecraft in interplanetary space Its primary purpose is to determine the viability and shielding needs for potential human explorers, as well as to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which it started doing immediately after MSL landed in August 2012 [129] Funded by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters and Germany's Space Agency (DLR), RAD was developed by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany [129] [130]\n\n\nDynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN)\nThe DAN instrument employs a neutron source and detector for measuring the quantity and depth of hydrogen or ice and water at or near the Martian surface [131] \nThe instrument consists of the detector element (DE) and a 14.1 MeV pulsing neutron generator (PNG) The die-away time of neutrons is measured by the DE after each neutron pulse from the PNG.\nDAN was provided by the Russian Federal Space Agency [132] [133] and funded by Russia [134]\n\n\nMars Descent Imager (MARDI)\nMARDI is fixed to the lower front left corner of the body of Curiosity During the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI took color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a 1.3-millisecond exposure time starting at distances of about 3.7 km (2.3 mi) to near 5 m (16 ft) from the ground, at a rate of four frames per second for about two minutes [87] [135] MARDI has a pixel scale of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at 2 km (1.2 mi) to 1.5 mm (0.059 in) at 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and has a 90° circular field of view MARDI has eight gigabytes of internal buffer memory that is capable of storing over 4,000 raw images MARDI imaging allowed the mapping of surrounding terrain and the location of landing [87] JunoCam, built for the Juno spacecraft, is based on MARDI [136]\n\n\nRobotic arm\nThe rover has a 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) long robotic arm with a cross-shaped turret holding five devices that can spin through a 350° turning range [138] [139] The arm makes use of three joints to extend it forward and to stow it again while driving It has a mass of 30 kg (66 lb) and its diameter, including the tools mounted on it, is about 60 cm (24 in) [140] It was designed, built, and tested by MDA US Systems, building upon their prior robotic arm work on the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander, the Phoenix lander, and the two Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity [141]\n\n\nMedia, cultural impact and legacy\nLive video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available at NASA TV, during the late hours of August 6, 2012, PDT, including interviews with the mission team The NASA website momentarily became unavailable from the overwhelming number of people visiting it, [150] and a 13-minute NASA excerpt of the landings on its YouTube channel was halted an hour after the landing by an automated copyright takedown notice from Scripps Local News, which prevented access for several hours [151] Around 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Times Square, to watch NASA's live broadcast of Curiosity's landing, as footage was being shown on the giant screen [152] Bobak Ferdowsi, Flight Director for the landing, became an Internet meme and attained Twitter celebrity status, with 45,000 new followers subscribing to his Twitter account, due to his Mohawk hairstyle with yellow stars that he wore during the televised broadcast [153] [154]\n\n\nImages\n\n\n\nComponents of Curiosity\n\n\n\nExample

author Ray Bradbury [6] Gale, an estimated 3.5 to 3.8 billion-year-old impact crater, is hypothesized to have first been gradually filled in by sediments; first water-deposited, and then wind-deposited, possibly until it was completely covered Wind erosion then scoured out the sediments, leaving an isolated 5.5 km (3.4 mi) mountain, Aeolis Mons (\"Mount Sharp\"), at the center of the 154 km (96 mi) wide crater Thus, it is believed that the rover may have the opportunity to study two billion years of Martian history in the sediments exposed in the mountain Additionally, its landing site is near an alluvial fan, which is hypothesized to be the result of a flow of ground water, either before the deposition of the eroded sediments or else in relatively recent geologic history [70] [71]\n\n\nRover's landing system\nPrevious NASA Mars rovers became active only after the successful entry, descent and landing on the Martian surface Curiosity, on the other hand, was active when it touched down on the surface of Mars, employing the rover suspension system for the final set-down [73]\n\n\nTravel status\nAs of August 16, 2024, the rover has driven 32.12 km (19.96 mi) from its landing site over 4255 sols (Martian days) [20]\n\n\nDuplicate testing rovers\nCuriosity has two full sized, vehicle system test beds (VSTB), a twin rover used for testing and problem solving, MAGGIE rover (Mars Automated Giant Gizmo for Integrated Engineering) with a computer brain and a Scarecrow rover without a computer brain They are housed at the JPL Mars Yard for problem solving on simulated Mars terrain [79] [80]\n\n\nScientific instruments\nThe general sample analysis strategy begins with high-resolution cameras to look for features of interest If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition If that signature is intriguing, the rover uses its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer to take a closer look If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nMast Camera (Mastcam)\nThe Mastcam system provides multiple spectra and true-color imaging with two cameras [85] The cameras can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels and up to 10 frames per second hardware-compressed video at 720p (1280×720) [90]\n\n\nChemistry and Camera complex (ChemCam)\nChemCam is a suite of two remote sensing instruments combined as one: a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and a Remote Micro Imager (RMI) telescope The ChemCam instrument suite was developed by the French CESR laboratory and the Los Alamos National Laboratory [94] [95] [96] The flight model of the mast unit was delivered from the French CNES to Los Alamos National Laboratory [97] The purpose of the LIBS instrument is to provide elemental compositions of rock and regolith, while the RMI gives ChemCam scientists high-resolution images of the sampling areas of the rocks and regolith that LIBS targets [94] [98] The LIBS instrument can target a rock or regolith sample up to 7 m (23 ft) away, vaporizing a small amount of it with about 50 to 75 5-nanosecond pulses from a 1067 nm infrared laser and then observes the spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock [99]\n\n\nNavigation cameras (Navcams)\nThe rover has two pairs of black and white navigation cameras mounted on the mast to support ground navigation [105] [106] The cameras have a 45° angle of view and use visible light to capture stereoscopic 3-D imagery [106] [107]\n\n\nRover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS)\nREMS comprises instruments to measure the Mars environment: humidity, pressure, temperatures, wind speeds, and ultraviolet radiation [108] It is a meteorological package that includes an ultraviolet sensor provided by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science The investigative team is led by Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Spanish Astrobiology Center and includes the Finnish Meteorological Institute as a partner [109] [110] All sensors are located around three elements: two booms attached to the rover's mast, the Ultraviolet Sensor (UVS) assembly located on the rover top deck, and the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) inside the rover body REMS provides new clues about the Martian general circulation, micro scale weather systems, local hydrological cycle, destructive potential of UV radiation, and subsurface habitability based on ground-atmosphere interaction [109]\n\n\nHazard avoidance cameras (Hazcams)\nThe rover has four pairs of black and white navigation cameras called hazcams, two pairs in the front and two pairs in the back [105] [111] They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and regolith [111] Each camera in a pair is hardlinked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy; only four out of the eight cameras are in use at any one time The cameras use visible light to capture stereoscopic three-dimensional (3-D) imagery [111] The cameras have a 120° field of view and map the terrain at up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in front of the rover [111] This imagery safeguards against the rover crashing into unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover to make its own safety choices [111]\n\n\nMars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)\nMAHLI is a camera on the rover's robotic arm, and acquires microscopic images of rock and regolith MAHLI can take true-color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a resolution as high as 14.5 µm per pixel MAHLI has an 18.3 to 21.3 mm (0.72 to 0.84 in) focal length and a 33.8–38.5° field of view [86] MAHLI has both white and ultraviolet Light-emitting diode (LED) illumination for imaging in darkness or fluorescence imaging MAHLI also has mechanical focusing in a range from infinite to millimeter distances [86] This system can make some images with focus stacking processing [112] MAHLI can store either the raw images or do real time lossless predictive or JPEG compression The calibration target for MAHLI includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a 1909 VDB Lincoln penny, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration [113]\n\n\nAlpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)\nThe APXS instrument irradiates samples with alpha particles and maps the spectra of X-rays that are re-emitted for determining the elemental composition of samples [114] Curiosity's APXS was developed by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) [114] MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA), the Canadian aerospace company that built the Canadarm and RADARSAT, were responsible for the engineering design and building of the APXS The APXS science team includes members from the University of Guelph, the University of New Brunswick, the University of Western Ontario, NASA, the University of California, San Diego and Cornell University [115] The APXS instrument takes advantage of particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and X-ray fluorescence, previously exploited by the Mars Pathfinder and the two Mars Exploration Rovers [114] [116]\n\n\nChemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin)\nCheMin is the Chemistry and Mineralogy X-ray powder diffraction and fluorescence instrument [118] CheMin is one of four spectrometers It can identify and quantify the abundance of the minerals on Mars It was developed by David Blake at NASA Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, [119] and won the 2013 NASA Government Invention of the year award [120] The rover can drill samples from rocks and the resulting fine powder is poured into the instrument via a sample inlet tube on the top of the vehicle A beam of X-rays is then directed at the powder and the crystal structure of the minerals deflects it at characteristic angles, allowing scientists to identify the minerals being analyzed [121]\n\n\nSample Analysis at Mars (SAM)\nThe SAM instrument suite analyzes organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples It consists of instruments developed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Laboratoire atmosphères, milieux, observations spatiales (LATMOS), the Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques (LISA) (jointly operated by France's CNRS and Parisian universities), and Honeybee Robotics, along with many additional external partners [82] [124] [125] The three main instruments are a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS), a gas chromatograph (GC) and a tunable laser spectrometer (TLS) These instruments perform precision measurements of oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars in order to distinguish between their geochemical or biological origin [82] [125] [126] [127]\n\n\nDust Removal Tool (DRT)\nThe Dust Removal Tool (DRT) is a motorized, wire-bristle brush on the turret at the end of Curiosity's arm The DRT was first used on a rock target named Ekwir_1 on January 6, 2013 Honeybee Robotics built the DRT [128]\n\n\nRadiation assessment detector (RAD)\nThe role of the Radiation assessment detector (RAD) instrument is to characterize the broad spectrum of radiation environment found inside the spacecraft during the cruise phase and while on Mars These measurements have never been done before from the inside of a spacecraft in interplanetary space Its primary purpose is to determine the viability and shielding needs for potential human explorers, as well as to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which it started doing immediately after MSL landed in August 2012 [129] Funded by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters and Germany's Space Agency (DLR), RAD was developed by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany [129] [130]\n\n\nDynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN)\nThe DAN instrument employs a neutron source and detector for measuring the quantity and depth of hydrogen or ice and water at or near the Martian surface [131] \nThe instrument consists of the detector element (DE) and a 14.1 MeV pulsing neutron generator (PNG) The die-away time of neutrons is measured by the DE after each neutron pulse from the PNG.\nDAN was provided by the Russian Federal Space Agency [132] [133] and funded by Russia [134]\n\n\nMars Descent Imager (MARDI)\nMARDI is fixed to the lower front left corner of the body of Curiosity During the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI took color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a 1.3-millisecond exposure time starting at distances of about 3.7 km (2.3 mi) to near 5 m (16 ft) from the ground, at a rate of four frames per second for about two minutes [87] [135] MARDI has a pixel scale of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at 2 km (1.2 mi) to 1.5 mm (0.059 in) at 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and has a 90° circular field of view MARDI has eight gigabytes of internal buffer memory that is capable of storing over 4,000 raw images MARDI imaging allowed the mapping of surrounding terrain and the location of landing [87] JunoCam, built for the Juno spacecraft, is based on MARDI [136]\n\n\nRobotic arm\nThe rover has a 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) long robotic arm with a cross-shaped turret holding five devices that can spin through a 350° turning range [138] [139] The arm makes use of three joints to extend it forward and to stow it again while driving It has a mass of 30 kg (66 lb) and its diameter, including the tools mounted on it, is about 60 cm (24 in) [140] It was designed, built, and tested by MDA US Systems, building upon their prior robotic arm work on the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander, the Phoenix lander, and the two Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity [141]\n\n\nMedia, cultural impact and legacy\nLive video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available at NASA TV, during the late hours of August 6, 2012, PDT, including interviews with the mission team The NASA website momentarily became unavailable from the overwhelming number of people visiting it, [150] and a 13-minute NASA excerpt of the landings on its YouTube channel was halted an hour after the landing by an automated copyright takedown notice from Scripps Local News, which prevented access for several hours [151] Around 1,000 people gathered in New York City's Times Square, to watch NASA's live broadcast of Curiosity's landing, as footage was being shown on the giant screen [152] Bobak Ferdowsi, Flight Director for the landing, became an Internet meme and attained Twitter celebrity status, with 45,000 new followers subscribing to his Twitter account, due to his Mohawk hairstyle with yellow stars that he wore during the televised broadcast [153] [154]\n\n\nImages\n\n\n\nComponents of Curiosity\n\n\n\nExample rover images\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

script reader, camera operator and director of corporate films and industrial films [19] [21] [22] He directed, wrote and edited the short film Larceny (1996), [23] which was filmed over a weekend in

insect with his shoe, only to discover that it is a miniature of himself [18] [26]\n\n\n2003–2013: Widespread recognition\nIn early 2003, Nolan approached Warner Bros with the idea of making a new Batman film, based on the character's origin story [62] Nolan was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world than a comic-book fantasy [63] He relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects during filming, with minimal use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) [64] Batman Begins (2005), the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, [65] was released to critical acclaim and commercial success [66] [67] Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman—along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson—Batman Begins revived the franchise [68] [69] Batman Begins was 2005's ninth-highest-grossing film and was praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance; [67] [70] it is cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s [71] Film author Ian Nathan wrote that within five years of his career, Nolan \" [went] from unknown to indie darling to gaining creative control over one of the biggest properties in Hollywood, and (perhaps unwittingly) fomenting the genre that would redefine the entire industry\" [72]\n\n\n2014–2019: Interstellar, Dunkirk and other activities\nNolan next directed, wrote and produced the science-fiction film Interstellar (2014) The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg [119] Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity [120] In a 2014 discussion of the film's physics, Nolan expressed his admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied \"in every aspect of our civilisation\" [121] Interstellar – starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain – was released to positive reviews and grossed $773 million worldwide [122] [123] Observing its \"visual dazzle, thematic ambition\", The New York Times's A O Scott wrote that Interstellar is a \"sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret\" [124] Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers called the film \"a real work of art\" and praised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations [125] Interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two academic papers [126] [127] The American Journal of Physics called for it to be shown in school science lessons [128] [129] At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominations [130] Also in 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas served as executive producers on Transcendence, the directorial debut of his longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister [131]\n\n\n2020–present: Tenet and Oppenheimer\nNolan's next film was the science fiction film Tenet (2020), described by Tom Shone of The Sunday Times as \"a globe-spinning riff on all things Nolanesque\" [156] Nolan had worked on the screenplay for more than five years after deliberating about its central ideas for over a decade [157] Delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenet was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theatres after the pandemic shutdown [158] The film tells the story of an unnamed protagonist (played by John David Washington) who travels through time to stop a world-threatening attack [159] It grossed $363 million worldwide on a production budget of $200 million, becoming Nolan's first to underperform at the box-office [160] Tenet was described as his most polarising film; critics praised the ambition and technical aspects but found its story confusing [161] [152] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five out of five, calling it \"a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility—but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination\" [162] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"a chilly, cerebral film—easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity\" [163] At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Production Design [164] Following the release of Tenet, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers [165] He served as an executive producer on Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021), a director's cut of 2017's Justice League [166]\n\n\nPersonal life and public image\nNolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19 [12] [20] She has worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997 [47] [180] The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles [181]\n\n\nFilmmaking style\nNolan's films are largely centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and personal identity [185] [186] His work is characterised by mathematically inspired ideas and images, unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and sound [d] Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan \"an emotional mathematician\" [191] BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz described him as \"an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning\" [192] Joseph Bevan wrote, \"His films allow arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot conceits.\" [105] Nolan views himself as \"an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system\" [193]\n\n\nRecognition\nNolan has made some of the most influential and popular films of his time [e] Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades, [46] [206] [207] and according to The Wall Street Journal, his \"ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry\" [208] His films have earned more than $6 billion [209] Nolan's films Memento and The Dark Knight have been selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant [210] [211] These films and Inception appeared in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and The Hollywood Reporter's poll of best films ever made [212] [213] In 2017, The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar featured in Empire magazine's poll of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\" [214] In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter listed Nolan as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment and described him as a \"franchise unto himself\" [215] Parade ranked Nolan number eight in its 2022 list of 75 Best Movie Directors of All Time [216]\n\n\nFilmography\nNolan has been nominated for eight Academy Awards (winning two), eight British Academy Film Awards (winning two) and six Golden Globe Awards (winning one) [44] [237] [238]

Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades. According to The Wall Street Journal, his ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry. His films have earned more than $6 billion.

idea of making a new Batman film, based on the character's origin story [62] Nolan was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world than a comic-book fantasy [63] He relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects during filming, with minimal use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) [64] Batman Begins (2005), the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point, [65] was released to critical acclaim and commercial success [66] [67] Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman—along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson—Batman Begins revived the franchise [68] [69] Batman Begins was 2005's ninth-highest-grossing film and was praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance; [67] [70] it is cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s [71] Film author Ian Nathan wrote that within five years of his career, Nolan \" [went] from unknown to indie darling to gaining creative control over

activities\nNolan next directed, wrote and produced the science-fiction film Interstellar (2014) The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by

art\" and praised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations [125] Interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two academic papers

praised the ambition and technical aspects but found its story confusing [161] [152] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five out of five, calling it \"a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility—but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination\" [162] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"a chilly, cerebral film—easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity\" [163] At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Production Design [164] Following the release of Tenet, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers [165] He served as an executive producer on

The incident resulted in the death of United States Capitol Police Officer William \"Billy\" Evans.\n\n**Incident**\n\nOn April 2, Officer Billy Evans was posted at a checkpoint on Constitution Avenue, which is usually used by senators and staff members on weekdays. The checkpoint is located about 100 yards from the entrance of the building on the Senate side. At around 1:00 p.m., a man deliberately crashed a blue Nissan Altima into the barricade. The vehicle struck Evans and another officer, causing both to be hospitalized. Evans was later pronounced dead from his injuries. After ramming the two officers, the driver exited the vehicle with a knife and lunged at officers, ignoring verbal commands before being shot by police. The perpetrator was arrested, hospitalized, and died of his wounds soon after the attack.\n\n**Victim**\n\nWilliam \"Billy\" Evans was the Capitol Police officer killed during the attack. He served for 18 years with the United States Capitol Police and was a member of the first responder unit. Evans was the sixth Capitol Police officer to die in the line of duty since the force was created in 1828. His death was met with an outpouring of condolences from lawmakers and the public, with many expressing their grief and gratitude for his service.\n\n**Perpetrator**\n\nThe assailant was identified as Noah Green, a 25-year-old man from West Virginia. Green was born into a family with ten children and grew up in Covington, Virginia. He graduated from Alleghany High School, where he played football and participated in track and field. Green attended Glenville State College before transferring to Christopher Newport University (CNU) in Newport News, Virginia, where he was a defensive back on the football team.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nGreen's early life and education are well-documented. He was an athletic and popular student in high school and college, but after graduating from CNU, he began to experience mental health issues. People who knew Green described him as increasingly paranoid and withdrawn, with concerns about his mental state growing among his loved ones.\n\n**Years before the attack**\n\nIn the years leading up to the attack, Green's mental health issues continued to deteriorate. He became deeply paranoid, leaving family and friends concerned for his well-being. A U.S. official said Green increasingly suffered delusions, paranoia, and suicidal thoughts, highlighting the complexities of his mental health struggles.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe investigation into the attack is ongoing, with authorities seeking to understand the motives behind Green's actions. Investigators believe that Green's attack was caused by a combination of his mental health issues and an ideological cause that he believed justified violence. Green had no known connection to a member of Congress and was not previously known to police.\n\n**Response**\n\nThe attack on the Capitol has been met with an outpouring of grief and concern from lawmakers and the public. Acting Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman said the attack \"has been an extremely difficult time\" for her police force, especially in the aftermath of the January 6 Capitol attack. The incident has highlighted the ongoing security concerns at the Capitol and the need for continued vigilance in the face of rising threats.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of attacks on United States Capitol Police officers\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* United States Capitol Police\n* Capitol Hill police officer shooting incident (2013)\n* Capitol Hill car attack (2018)\n\nThis article is a summary of the 2021 United States Capitol car attack, including the incident, victim, perpetrator, investigation, and response.

few months before the two murders he was accused of Simpson played the leader of a group of former United States Navy SEALs named John \"Bullfrog\" Burke who operated out of a surf shop in Malibu [68] NBC had not yet decided whether to order the series when Simpson's arrest canceled the project NBC executive Preston Beckman collected each copy of Frogmen to ensure that no copy leaked to the media [68] While searching his home, the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and dailies Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson received \"a fair amount of\" military training—including use of a knife—for Frogmen, and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, this material was not introduced as evidence during the trial [69]\n\n\n2000s\nIn 2006, Simpson starred in his own improv-based hidden-camera prank TV show, Juiced Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on everyday people while secretly filming them At the end of each prank, he would shout, \"You've been Juiced!\" Each episode opened with half-dressed models dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp and sings his own rap song [71] In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas, where he attempts to sell a white Ford Bronco (the SUV model that became infamous during his 1994 police chase) [71] [72] A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they \"ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability.\" [71] In another sketch, Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend Later, he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish is to call a game of bingo Juiced aired as a one-time special

Simpson was already wealthy enough to \"retire this week if  [he] wanted to.\" [81]\nBeginning in 1975, he appeared in advertisements with the Hertz rental car company Commercials depicted Simpson running through airports (embodying speed), as others shouted to him the Hertz slogan \"Go, O.J., Go!\" [82] He was the first Black man to be hired for a major corporate national advertising campaign, [2] a unique decision for a conservative, dominant corporation to fend off its rival, No 2 Avis [83] Besides helping his acting career, Simpson estimated that the very successful \"superstar in rent-a-car\" campaign raised the recognition rate among people he met from 30% to 90% [11] Hertz's annual profit increased by 50% to $42.2 million within the first year, brand awareness increased by more than 40%, [61] and 97% of viewers understood that the commercials advertised Hertz, avoiding the common \"vampire video\" problem [11] of viewers remembering an ad, but not which brand it promotes Simpson was so important to the company that CEO Frank Olson personally negotiated his contract, and Hertz used him for an unusually long time for a celebrity endorser Although Simpson appeared less often in Hertz commercials by the late 1980s, his relationship with the company continued; Simpson was to travel to Chicago to meet with Hertz executives and clients on the night of the Brown-Goldman murder [82]\n\n\nMarriages with Marguerite Whitley and Nicole Brown\nOn June 24, 1967, Simpson married Marguerite L Whitley Together, they had three children: Arnelle L Simpson (b 1968),

began, it was discovered the police investigation had been flawed: \"Photo evidence had been lost or mislabeled; DNA had been collected and stored improperly, raising a possibility that it was tainted.\" [16]\n\n\nVerdict and aftermath\nThe New York Times wrote that \"in the end, it was the defense that had the overwhelming case, with many grounds for reasonable doubt, the standard for acquittal.\" [16] The trial culminated after 11 months on October 3, 1995, when the jury rendered a verdict of \"not guilty\" for the two murders [112] Around 100 to 150 million people nationwide tuned in to watch or listen to the verdict announcement [101] [112] The jury deliberation lasted three hours By the end, the trial produced \"126 witnesses, 1,105 items of evidence and 45,000 pages of

Simpson filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson Daniel Petrocelli represented plaintiff Fred Goldman (Ronald Goldman's father), while Robert Baker represented Simpson [131] Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki presided, [131] and he barred television and still cameras, radio equipment, and courtroom sketch artists from the courtroom [132] The trial excluded discussion of racial issues, which were considered \"inflammatory and speculative.\" [16] On October 23, 1996, opening statements were made, and on January 16, 1997, both sides rested their cases [133]\n\n\nOther legal troubles\nIn the late 1990s, Simpson attempted to register \"O J Simpson\", \"O J.\", and \"The Juice\" as trademarks for \"a broad range of goods, including figurines, trading cards, sportswear, medallions, coins, and prepaid telephone cards.\" [141] A \"concerned citizen\", William B Ritchie, sued to oppose the granting of federal registration on the grounds that doing so would be immoral and scandalous [142]\n\n\nIf I Did It book\nNicole Jesus I looked down and saw her on the ground in front of me,\ncurled up in a fetal position at the base of the stairs, not moving.\nGoldman was only a few feet away, slumped against the bars of the\nfence He wasn't moving either Both he and Nicole were lying in\ngiant pools of blood I had never seen so much blood in my life It\ndidn't seem real, and none of it computed.\n\n\nLas Vegas robbery\nOn the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room at the Palace Station hotel-casino and took sports memorabilia at gunpoint, which resulted in Simpson being questioned by police [157] [158] Simpson admitted to taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the hotel room; he also denied that he or anyone else carried a gun [159] [160] He was initially released after questioning [161]\n\n\nRelease from prison\nOn July 31, 2013, the Nevada Parole Board granted Simpson parole on some convictions, but his imprisonment continued based on the weapons and assault convictions The board considered Simpson's prior record of criminal convictions and good behavior in prison in coming to the decision [189] At his parole hearing on July 20, 2017, the board decided to grant Simpson parole, with certain parole conditions such as travel restrictions, non-contact with co-defendants from the robbery, and not drinking excessively He was released on October 1, having served almost nine years [190] [191] In December 2021, Simpson was granted an early discharge from parole by the Nevada Division of Parole and Probation, for good behavior [192]\n\n\nPersonal life\nStarting in the mid-1970s, Simpson was friends with brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, who later became famous for the 1989 arrests, trial, and convictions for the murders of their parents He visited their house several times The three met up again in prison after Simpson was arrested for double murder in the 1990s [193]\n\n\nIllness and death\nIn May 2023, Simpson reported that he had been diagnosed with cancer and expressed confidence that he would beat it [202] He also said he started chemotherapy [2] In February 2024, it was reported that Simpson was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer [203] A week and a half before his death, Simpson cancelled a scheduled memorabilia signing because he was not feeling well [204] In his last Twitter video on February 11, he said that while he was \"dealing with some issues\", he was in good health [17] In the final days before his death, all of Simpson's children visited him [205] He died of the disease on April 10, 2024, at the age of 76 [206] [16] At the time, Simpson had been living in Las Vegas, right next to the Rhodes Ranch Golf Club [16] Simpson shared a home with his oldest daughter Arnelle while his youngest son Justin lived up the street from him [207]\n\n\nMoney owed\nSimpson's longtime Las Vegas attorney Malcolm LaVergne was named as Simpson's \"personal representative\" and executor of the will and testament, according to court records Justin Simpson, Simpson's son, was named as \"successor personal representative.\" In August 2024, LaVergne revealed that Simpson owed him $269,000 at the time of his death and that he was seeking to claim possession of Simpson's \"forever home\" in Las Vegas from Simpson's son Justin as part of a way to pay off the debt [237] [238] [239] Speaking to TMZ, LaVergne confirmed that due to Simpson's outstanding debts, such as those related in the 1997 civil ruling, the expensive funeral and $500,000 Simpson owed to the state of California, he was making an effort to liquidate Simpson's assets, and that Simpson's family was putting up resistance to his efforts [237] [238] Simpson's creditors include not just the Goldman family, but also the IRS and the California Tax Board [238] [237] Simpson's decision to change his primary residence from Florida to Nevada also made him more vulnerable to the Goldman family being able to collect money from what he earned through his NFL pension, with Ron Goldman's father Fred seeking $117 million as of July 2024 [239] [240] Simpson's ashes would be made into jewelry (memorial diamonds), with only his four children taking possession [239] [241] LaVergne confirmed that he did not take possession of any of the cremation jewelry, telling TMZ that he had no interest in possessing Simpson's ashes [239] [241] According to Lavergne, $4,243.06 was spent to go through with Simpson's cremation, create the jewelry, and draw up the death certificates [239]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe New York Times wrote that Simpson \"generated a tide of tell-all books, movies, studies and debate over questions of justice, race relations and celebrity in a nation that adores its heroes.\" More than 30 books were written on Simpson by the time of his death [16]\n\n\nOverview\nThe New York Times wrote that Simpson \"generated

time of his death [16]\n\n\nFilm and television\nDuring and after the murder trial, Simpson was the frequent subject of mocking jokes by Norm Macdonald on Saturday Night Live These jokes, which became famous, are widely believed to have caused Macdonald to be fired by NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer, who was friends with Simpson [242] [243] Television host Conan O'Brien remembered Macdonald's comedy as the most notable commentary about Simpson's trials [244] In the wake of Simpson's death, Macdonald's jokes about him went viral [245] Prior to Macdonald's death, he jokingly claimed to have changed his mind about Simpson's guilt According to Macdonald's friend Lori Jo Hoekstra, however, that new commentary was enough for Simpson to reach out to Macdonald and offer to play golf

evidence had been lost or mislabeled; DNA had been collected and stored improperly, raising a possibility that it was tainted.\" [16]\n\n\nVerdict and aftermath\nThe New York Times wrote that \"in the

LaVergne confirmed that due to Simpson's outstanding debts, such as those related in the 1997 civil ruling, the expensive funeral and $500,000 Simpson owed to the state of California, he was making an effort to liquidate Simpson's assets, and that Simpson's family was putting up resistance to his efforts [237] [238] Simpson's creditors include not just the Goldman family, but also the IRS and the California Tax Board [238] [237] Simpson's decision to change his primary residence from Florida to Nevada also made him more vulnerable to the Goldman family being able to collect money from what he earned through his NFL pension, with Ron Goldman's father Fred seeking $117 million as of July 2024 [239] [240] Simpson's ashes would be made into jewelry (memorial diamonds), with only his four children taking possession [239] [241] LaVergne confirmed that he did not take possession of any of the cremation jewelry, telling TMZ that he had no interest in possessing Simpson's ashes [239] [241]

Macdonald's jokes about him went viral [245] Prior to Macdonald's death, he jokingly claimed to have changed his mind about Simpson's guilt According to Macdonald's friend Lori Jo Hoekstra, however,

Born on January 15, 1998, in Hanwell, London, England, Kelly began playing football at a young age and has since developed into one of the most talented players in the world.\n\n## Early Life\n\nKelly was born to Jane and Noel Kelly, a machinery engineer, and was raised in the West London district of Hanwell. She was the youngest of seven siblings and credits her family with instilling a love for football in her from a young age. Kelly's brothers, all of whom played football, would often take her to the local park, where she would watch and learn from them. As she grew older, Kelly began to play with her brothers, developing her skills and learning the game.\n\n## Club Career\n\nKelly's footballing career began with her local club, Queens Park Rangers, before she joined Arsenal's Centre of Excellence at the age of 12. She traveled two hours round trip by train to train with the club, a sacrifice that ultimately paid off when she made her debut for the Arsenal first team in 2015. Kelly's first appearance came on July 23, 2015, in the Continental Cup against Watford, where she scored her first goal just 22 minutes into the match.\n\nKelly went on to make a total of two appearances for Arsenal, including a 2-1 win over Notts County, where she came on as a substitute in the 54th minute. Her performances caught the attention of Everton, who loaned her for three months in June 2016 to gain additional first-team experience. Kelly made nine starts for the Toffees, scoring two goals and helping the team to a 4-2-2 record.\n\n## Everton (2017-2019)\n\nIn January 2018, Kelly signed a permanent contract with Everton, alongside Arsenal teammate Taylor Hinds. She made a total of 15 appearances for the team during the 2017-2018 FA WSL season, scoring two goals. Everton finished the season in ninth place, with a 4-12-2 record. The following season, Kelly made 11 appearances and scored a goal, despite playing on an ankle injury throughout the season. Everton finished the 2018-2019 FA WSL season in 10th place.\n\n## Manchester City (2020-Present)\n\nOn July 3, 2020, Kelly signed a two-year contract with Manchester City. She made an immediate impact, scoring a brace against Tottenham Hotspur in her debut season. Kelly went on to produce 16 goals and 14 assists in her debut season, earning her a spot in the PFA WSL Team of the Year. She has since become a key player for the team, scoring crucial goals and providing assists.\n\n## International Career\n\nKelly has represented England on the senior national team, as well as numerous youth national teams, including the under-17 and under-20 squads. She made her senior national team debut in November 2018, coming on as a substitute in a 3-0 friendly win over Austria in Vienna.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nKelly married her long-term boyfriend, Scott Moore, in July 2024.\n\n## Career Statistics\n\n### Club\n\n| Club | Season | League | Cup | Continental | Total |\n| Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals |\n| Manchester City | 2020-2021 | 16 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 | 16 |\n\n### International\n\n| National Team | Season | Apps | Goals |\n| England | 2018-2019 | 5 | 2 |\n\n## Honours\n\n* FA WSL Team of the Year: 2020-2021\n\n## See Also\n\n* List of England women's international footballers\n* List of Manchester City F.C. women's players\n* List of FA WSL players\n\nNote: This article is subject to change as new information becomes available.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chloe_Kelly\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nKelly was born on 15 January 1998 to Jane and Noel Kelly, a machinery engineer, and was raised in the West London district of Hanwell where she went to school at Elthorne Park High School She was the youngest of seven siblings [2] [3] She began playing football at a young age with her five brothers [4] She often played in football cages in Windmill Park in Ealing, which she credits with making her the player she became As part of the \"Where Greatness Is Made\" campaign, a plaque honouring Kelly was installed at the cages in 2022 [5] Before joining Arsenal's Centre of Excellence, she played for Queens Park Rangers [2] She travelled two hours round trip by train as a young teenager to train with Arsenal [2] Her footballing idol when she was growing up was Bobby Zamora, once also a Queens Park Rangers player [6]\n\n\nClub career\nOn 23 July 2015, aged 17, Kelly made her full debut for the Arsenal first team in the Continental Cup against Watford, scoring her first goal just 22 minutes into the match [7] She made her second appearance for the club during a 2–1 win over Notts County, subbing in for Rachel Yankey in the 54th minute [8]\n\n\nArsenal\nOn 23 July 2015, aged 17, Kelly made her full debut for the Arsenal first team in the Continental Cup against Watford, scoring her first goal just 22 minutes into the match [7] She made her second appearance for the club during a 2–1 win over Notts County, subbing in for Rachel Yankey in the 54th minute [8]\n\n\nEverton (loan)\nIn June 2016, Kelly joined FA WSL 2 side Everton on a three-month loan in order to gain additional first team experience [15] She made nine starts for the Toffees, and scored two goals [8]\n\n\nEverton\nIn January 2018, Kelly made a permanent transfer to Everton on contract through summer 2020, alongside Arsenal teammate Taylor Hinds [17] She made a total of 15 appearances for Everton during the 2017–18 FA WSL season and scored two goals [8] Everton finished in ninth place with a 4–12–2 record [18] During the 2018-19 FA WSL season, Kelly made eleven appearances and scored a goal during the team's 3–3 draw against Brighton & Hove Albion despite playing on an ankle injury throughout the season [8] Everton finished in 10th place [19] [4]\n\n\nManchester City\nOn 3 July 2020, it was announced Kelly had signed a two-year contract with Manchester City [24] [25] In September 2020, she was named to the PFA WSL Team of the Year [26] On 4 October, she scored a brace against Tottenham Hotspur lifting the team to a 4–1 win [27] During the team's 3–1 loss to Chelsea a few days later, she converted a penalty kick in the 73rd minute for Manchester City's lone goal of the match [28] In her debut season, she produced 16 goals and 14 assists [29]\n\n\nInternational career\nKelly has represented England on the senior national team as well as numerous youth national teams, including the under-17 and under-20 squads.\n\n\nYouth\nIn 2014, Kelly competed at the 2014 UEFA Under-17 Championship in England, coming fourth, [34] [35] and the 2015 UEFA Under-17 Championship in Iceland, exiting in the group stage [36] [37] In November 2015, she scored an equaliser against Italy to earn a draw for the under-19 team [38]\n\n\nSenior\nKelly made her senior national team debut in November 2018, coming in as a substitute in a 3–0 friendly win over Austria in Vienna [39]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKelly married her long-term boyfriend, Scott Moore in July 2024 [57] [58]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nManchester City\n\n\nClub\nManchester City\n\n\nInternational\nManchester City\n\n\nHonours\nManchester City\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

night games from 1978 to 1986 as part of its Monday Night Football package Prior to the new contract, ESPN carried a handful of sporadic Thursday night games (usually those displaced from Sunday night) and the broadcast networks used to air several national games on Saturday afternoons in mid-to-late December after the college football regular season ended Incidentally, the only reason the league is even allowed to televise football games on Saturday night stems from a legal loophole: the league's antitrust exemption, the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, was written when the NFL regular season ended in mid-December, and as such, it contains specific language that prohibits televising NFL games in most markets on Friday nights and all day on Saturdays between the second week of September and the second week of December, to protect high school and college football Since most high school and college seasons have ended by mid-December, other than bowl games, there has been little desire to close this loophole, even though the regular season has expanded well beyond mid-December since the law's passage.\n\n\nEarly history\nThe NFL Network's coverage was not the first time that NFL games were covered on Thursday or Saturday ABC televised occasional Thursday night games from 1978 to 1986 as part of its Monday Night Football package Prior to the new contract, ESPN

college seasons have ended by mid-December, other than bowl games, there has been little desire to close this loophole, even though the regular season has expanded well beyond mid-December since the law's passage.\n\n\n2014–2015: partnership with CBS Sports\nIn January 2014, it was reported that the NFL was planning to sub-license a package of up to eight Thursday Night Football games to another broadcaster for the 2014 season The NFL had negotiated with its existing broadcast partners, along with Turner Sports These eight games were to be simulcast by NFL Network, and reports indicated that ESPN planned to place the games on ABC in the event it won the rights, bringing the NFL back to ABC for the first time since Super Bowl XL and the move of Monday Night Football to ESPN in 2006 [4] [5] [6] [7] The remaining games would remain exclusive to NFL Network, in order to satisfy carriage agreements with television providers guaranteeing a minimum number of games to air exclusively on the channel [8] The decision came as the league wished to heighten the profile of its Thursday night games, which had suffered from relatively lower viewership and advertising revenue in comparison to other games [9]\n\n\n2016–2017: CBS, NBC, and tri-cast with Twitter and Amazon Prime Video\nIn November 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that in response to the success of the package under CBS, the NFL was planning to negotiate a long-term contract for TNF, with CBS, Fox, NBC, and Turner Sports showing interest [23] The New York Post reported that this deal would also include the sale of a stake in NFL Network itself [8]\n\n\n2018–2021: Fox and Amazon Prime Video\nIn early January 2018, Bloomberg reported that ABC/ESPN and Fox Sports had both made bids for the next TNF package Both Fox and Fox Sports 1 were named as potential outlets for the package in the Fox Sports bid, which was intended to showcase Fox's continued commitment to sports after the sale of its entertainment businesses to ESPN's majority-owner The Walt Disney Company (which excluded the Fox network itself and Fox Sports' national operations, such as FS1, among other assets) CBS and NBC were also considering renewing their existing contracts, but had requested a lower rights fee to compensate for the decreasing viewership of the NFL (TNF had been cited as one factor in the downturn, due to a perceived oversaturation of nationally televised games) It was also reported that the NFL would also allow digital companies to make bids for exclusive rights to the TNF package which forego a television partner entirely, unlike the previous non-exclusive deals with Twitter and Amazon [43]\n\n\n2022–2033: Amazon Prime Video\nIn March 2021, Amazon acquired exclusive rights to TNF as part of the next round of NFL broadcasting agreements from 2023 through 2033 NFL Network, Fox, and Amazon subsequently opted out of the final year of the current agreement, meaning that Amazon's rights would begin in the 2022 NFL season instead [48] Also in that time, reports have verified that Amazon was close to partnering with NBC Sports to produce their broadcasts, and their contract is likely to be a three-year deal with Amazon having the option to extend it to five [61]\n\n\nCoverage\nThe initial NFL Network team consisted of HBO Sports' Bryant Gumbel as play-by-play announcer, NBC Sports' Cris Collinsworth as the color commentator for the Thursday telecasts, and Dick Vermeil replacing Collinsworth for Saturday telecasts In 2007, Collinsworth replaced Vermeil alongside Gumbel for all games.\n\n\nGame announcers\nThis table shows the National Football League teams' all-time standings for games played on Thursday Night Football.\n\n\nPregame coverage\nThis table shows the National

during the network's terms in its carriage contracts during negotiations These disputes were magnified throughout the 2007 season, as two high-profile matchups were to be broadcast by the network The first was a matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers which was scheduled for the week after Thanksgiving and saw both teams at 10–1, vying for the top seed in the NFC, and the second was Week 17 Saturday night game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants, where the Patriots had a chance to become the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to end a regular season undefeated.\n\n\nCarriage\nUpon the original launch of the Thursday and Saturday night games, few television service providers carried the NFL Network due to disputes during the network's terms in its

and viewership\nThursday Night Football games on NFL Network are among the lowest-rated nationally televised NFL broadcasts Critics have argued that the games televised on Thursday Night Football have been of lower quality than other prime time games, as they often featured match-ups between lesser or poor-performing teams, and that the shortened rest between games triggered by Thursday games also has an effect on their overall quality [16] [17] In an analysis by Sports on Earth writer Aaron Roberts, it was determined that most Thursday games were of average or above-average quality in comparison to normal, non-prime time games, but that this was \"by design\" due to the leverage of other NFL broadcasters on how games are scheduled throughout the season (which traditionally prioritizes \"major\" games for either late-afternoon or Sunday and Monday nights) [111] [112]\n\n\nPlayer safety\nAs mentioned, a team needing to play a Thursday night game can result in a shortened rest period for players between games [16] [17] On October 6, 2014, Arian Foster, then of the Houston Texans, made a statement considering it hypocritical for the NFL to emphasize the safety of players (particularly in regards to concussions) while allowing its players to play a game on only three days' rest, which he considered to be equally \"dangerous\" [118] Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks has also voiced displeasure about Thursday night games reducing prep time, and wrote a 2016 editorial for The Players' Tribune about the games [133] Sherman's 2017 season (and his run with the Seahawks; he would sign a new deal with the San Francisco 49ers in the 2018 off-season) would end on November 9, 2017 during a Thursday night game against the Arizona Cardinals, when he ruptured his Achilles tendon [134]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Thursday Night Football (TNF) is a series of National Football League

{"title": "Sheikh_Hasina", "content": "\nEarly life\nHasina was born on 28 September 1947 to the Bengali Muslim Sheikh family of Tungipara in East Bengal [39] [40] Her father was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and her mother was Begum Fazilatunnesa Mujib [41] [42] Hasina grew up in Tungipara during her early childhood under the care of her mother and grandmother When the family moved to Dhaka, they initially lived in the neighborhood of Segunbagicha [43]\n\n\nEducation and marriage\nHasina attended primary school in her village of Tungipara When her family moved to Dhaka, she attended the Azimpur Girls' School and Begum Badrunnesa Girls' College [46] She enrolled for a bachelor's degree at Eden College She was elected as the Vice President of the Students Union in Eden College between 1966 and 1967 [47] In 1967, she married M A Wazed Miah, who was a Bengali nuclear scientist with a doctorate in physics from Durham [48] Hasina studied Bengali literature at Dhaka University, from where she graduated in 1973 [47] [49] [50] [51] Hasina lived in Rokeya Hall, which was founded in 1938 as the women's dormitory of Dhaka University; and later named after feminist Begum Rokeya [52] [47] She was involved in the politics of the Students League and was elected as the general secretary of the women's unit in Rokeya Hall [47]\n\n\nFamily murder, exile and return\nExcept for her husband, children and sister Sheikh Rehana, Hasina's entire family was murdered during the 15 August 1975 Bangladeshi coup d'état which saw the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman [53] [54] Dictator Hasina, Wazed and Rehana were visiting Europe at the time of the assassination They took refuge in the house of the Bangladeshi ambassador to West Germany; before taking up an offer of political asylum from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India [55] [56] [57] The surviving members of the family lived in exile in New Delhi, India for six years [58] [59] Dictator Hasina was barred from entering Bangladesh by the military government of Ziaur Rahman [60] After she was elected President of the Bangladesh Awami League on 16 February 1981, Hasina returned home on 17 May 1981 and received a welcome from thousands of Awami League supporters [44] [61]\n\n\nEarly political career\nWhile living in exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Awami League in 1981 [62] The party has been described as a \"Centre-Left\" party [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nMovement against military rule (1981–1991)\nWhile living in exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Awami League in 1981 [62] The party has been described as a \"Centre-Left\" party [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition (1991–1996)\nAfter several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes had paralysed the economy Government officers refused to follow orders and resigned Members of the Bangladesh Rifles laid down their weapons instead of firing on protestors and curfew was openly violated Hasina worked with Khaleda Zia in organising opposition to Ershad [20] A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted Ershad from power when he resigned in favour of his vice president, Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Chief Justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court The caretaker government, headed by Ahmed, administered a general election for the parliament The BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, won a general majority, and Hasina's Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party [21] Of the three constituencies Hasina contested, she lost in two and won in one Accepting defeat, she offered her resignation as the party president but stayed on at the request of party leaders [citation needed]\n\n\nFirst premiership (1996–2001)\nThe Awami League (AL), with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution [71] The ruling BNP refused to act on these demands [74]\n\n\nLeader of the Opposition (2001–2008)\nThe Awami League MPs were irregular in attending parliament during the following period [81] In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary Abdul Jolil that the government would fall before 30 April 2004.\n\n\nAssassination attempt (2004)\nDuring her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased MP Ahsanullah Master died after he was shot in May 2004 This was followed by a grenade attack on 21 August on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 24 party supporters, including Ivy Rahman, party women's secretary In October 2018, a special court gave verdicts in two cases filed over the incident; the court ruled that it was a well-orchestrated plan, executed through abuse of state power, and all the accused, including BNP Senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman (in absentia) and former top intelligence officials, were found guilty The court prescribed various punishments [82] SAMS Kibria, Hasina's close advisor and former finance minister was assassinated that year (2004) in a grenade attack in Sylhet [83] [84]\n\n\nLogi Boitha Movement\nIn October 2006, Sheikh Hasina and Awami League launched the Logi Boitha Movement where thousands of Awami League workers started occupying different streets of Dhaka with boathooks and Oars for several days This resulted in a number of casualties, vandalisms, lootings as well as soaring prices of daily commodities.\n\n\nDetention during military intervention (2006–2008)\nThe months preceding the planned 22 January 2007 elections were filled with political unrest and controversy [87] Following the end of Khaleda Zia's government in October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the Caretaker Government The caretaker government had difficulty bringing all parties to the table The AL and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favoured the BNP [88]\n\n\nSecond premiership (2009–2024)\nOn 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to contest the 2008 general election scheduled for 29 December [124] She decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the banner of the \"Grand Alliance\" with the Jatiya Party, led by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, as its main partner On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021 [125]\n\n\nSecond term (2009–2014)\nOn 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to contest the 2008 general election scheduled for 29 December [124] She decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the banner of the \"Grand Alliance\" with the Jatiya Party, led by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, as its main partner On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021 [125]\n\n\nThird term (2014–2019)\nHasina secured a second-consecutive term in office with her ruling Awami League and its Grand Alliance allies, winning the 2014 general election by a landslide The election was boycotted by leading opposition parties due to unfair conditions and a lack of non-partisan administration to conduct elections [145] As a result, the AL-led Grand Alliance won 267 seats out of which 153 were uncontested, surpassing its 2008 poll success—when it secured 263 parliamentary seats [146] Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009 and won 288 seats in this election [147] One of the leading opposition parties accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes [146] The election was boycotted by major opposition parties including the BNP [148]\n\n\nFourth term (2019–2024)\nHasina won her third consecutive term, her fourth overall, when her Awami League won 288 of the 300 parliamentary seats The leader of the main opposition alliance, Kamal Hossain, declared the vote \"farcical\" and rejected the results Before the election, Human Rights Watch and other rights organisations had accused the government of creating an intimidating environment for the Opposition [166] The New York Times editorial board described the election as farcical, the editorial stated that it was likely Hasina would have won without vote-rigging and questioned why she did so [167]\n\n\nFifth term (2024)\nIn January 2024 Hasina won her fourth consecutive term when her party, the Awami League, won 224 of the 300 parliamentary seats amidst a low voter turnout in an election boycotted by the main opposition [180] She was inaugurated on 11 January [181] [182]\n\n\nResignation and flight from Bangladesh\nHasina resigned on 5 August 2024, as large crowds of demonstrators surrounded the prime minister's residence [203] Her resignation was announced by General Waker-uz-Zaman, the Chief of the Army Staff [d] Later that day, Hasina fled to India in a chaotic departure, first by car, then by helicopter, and finally by plane [203] She left with no resignation speech [203]\n\n\nPost-premiership\nAs of 10 September 2024, Hasina is facing 152 cases which include 135 for murder, 7 for crimes against humanity and genocide, 3 for abduction, 6 for attempted murder and 1 for the attack on a BNP procession [223] [224] These cases include other former government officials - Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Transport and Bridges Minister and concurrent Awami League secretary-general Obaidul Quader, and others [225] The International Crimes Tribunal opened an investigation on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against her and nine senior government and Awami League officials over their role in the crackdown on the protests following a petition by the father of a killed student [226] The BNP requested India to extradite Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh for prosecution against the cases registered on her [227]\n\n\nElectoral history\nThe Padma Bridge graft scandal involved the ruling Awami League government that allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, a large amount of money from the Canadian construction company SNC-Lavalin The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and a Canadian court subsequently dismissed the case [232]\n\n\nReception\nThe Padma Bridge graft scandal involved the ruling Awami League government that allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, a large amount of money from the Canadian construction company SNC-Lavalin The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and a Canadian court subsequently dismissed the case [232]\n\n\nCriticisms and Controversies\nThe July massacre 2024 was one of the most violent crackdowns in Bangladesh's history, ordered by Sheikh Hasina’s government to suppress a student-led protest The protest began as a peaceful demonstration demanding reforms to the education system, but it quickly escalated into a nationwide movement On July 15, 2024, security forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police, opened fire on unarmed students, many of whom were between the ages of 5 to 30 years old \n\n\n2024 July Massacre\nThe July massacre 2024 was one of the most violent crackdowns in Bangladesh's history, ordered by Sheikh Hasina’s government to suppress a student-led protest The protest began as a peaceful demonstration demanding reforms to the education system, but it quickly escalated into a nationwide movement On July 15, 2024, security forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police, opened fire on unarmed students, many of whom were between the ages of 5 to 30 years old \n\n\nElection Manipulation\nSheikh Hasina’s government has faced repeated allegations of manipulating elections to maintain power The 2014 general election, boycotted by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led to a one-sided result, with the ruling Awami League winning most seats uncontested [252] Similar accusations surfaced in the 2018 election, with widespread reports of vote rigging and obstruction of opposition voters [253]\n\n\nSuppression of Opposition and Media\nUnder Hasina's government, opposition leaders, particularly from the BNP, have been frequently arrested or harassed The imprisonment of BNP leader Khaleda Zia on corruption charges is seen by many [who?] as a politically motivated move to weaken the opposition [254] Hasina’s government has also cracked down on media freedom, using laws like the Digital Security Act to detain journalists and activists critical of the regime [255]\n\n\nExtrajudicial Arrests and Disappearances\nHuman rights groups have condemned Sheikh Hasina’s government for its use of midnight arrests and enforced disappearances, particularly targeting political opponents, activists, and journalists Security forces like the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) are accused of abducting individuals from their homes during the night, many of whom were never seen again [256] Victims of these disappearances often included opposition members or activists who were critical of the regime These practices have led to international outcry, with the United States imposing sanctions on RAB in 2021 for its involvement in human rights violations [257]\n\n\nMoney Laundering and Allegations of Corruption in Infrastructure Projects\nSheikh Hasina's government has been accused of corruption and money laundering, especially in relation to large infrastructure projects such as the Padma Bridge and Dhaka Metro Rail In 2012, the World Bank withdrew its funding from the Padma Bridge project, citing allegations of a conspiracy to commit corruption involving senior government officials [258] Though the charges were later dismissed in a Canadian court, critics argue that corruption still plagued the project Similarly, the Dhaka Metro Rail project has faced accusations of cost inflation and kickbacks involving government officials, further fueling concerns of misuse of state funds [259]\n\n\nRenaming of Public Institutions and Allegations of Dynastic Politics\nA prominent point of criticism during Sheikh Hasina's tenure has been the renaming of infrastructure, institutions, and public spaces in honor of her family members, particularly her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh [260] Major projects, such as the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, have either been renamed or established in his name This practice has also extended to other family members, prompting critics to accuse Hasina of fostering a cult of personality and reinforcing dynastic politics [261]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1968, Hasina married M A Wazed Miah (1942–2009), a Bangladeshi physicist, writer, and chairman of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission [39] [41] They have a son, Sajeeb Wazed, and a daughter, Saima Wazed [39] Saima's father-in-law is a former minister of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment and LGRD, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain [262] Hasina's only living sibling, Sheikh Rehana, served as the adviser of Tungipara upazila unit Awami League in Gopalganj in 2017 [263] Hasina's niece (and Sheikh Rehana's daughter) is Tulip Siddiq, a British Labour Party politician and elected Member of Parliament and City Minister [264]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nHonours and awards\n\n\nHonorary doctorates\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

When the family moved to Dhaka, they initially lived in the neighborhood of Segunbagicha.\n\nEducation and marriage\nHasina attended primary school in her village of Tungipara. When her family moved to Dhaka, she attended the Azimpur Girls' School and Begum Badrunnesa Girls' College. She enrolled for a bachelor's degree at Eden College, where she was elected as the Vice President of the Students Union between 1966 and 1967. In 1967, she married MA Wazed Miah, a Bengali nuclear scientist with a doctorate in physics from Durham. Hasina studied Bengali literature at Dhaka University, from where she graduated in 1973. She lived in Rokeya Hall, which was founded in 1938 as the women's dormitory of Dhaka University, and later named after feminist Begum Rokeya. She was involved in the politics of the Students League and was elected as the general secretary of the women's unit in Rokeya Hall.\n\nFamily murder, exile, and return\nExcept for her husband, children, and sister Sheikh Rehana, Hasina's entire family was murdered during the 15 August 1975 Bangladeshi coup d'état, which saw the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hasina, her husband, and Rehana were visiting Europe at the time of the assassination. They took refuge in the house of the Bangladeshi ambassador to West Germany, before taking up an offer of political asylum from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India. The surviving members of the family lived in exile in New Delhi, India, for six years. Hasina was barred from entering Bangladesh by the military government of Ziaur Rahman. After she was elected President of the Bangladesh Awami League on 16 February 1981, Hasina returned home on 17 May 1981, and received a welcome from thousands of Awami League supporters.\n\nEarly political career\nWhile living in exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Awami League in 1981. The party has been described as a \"centre-left\" party.\n\nMovement against military rule (1981-1991)\nWhile living in exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Awami League in 1981. The party has been described as a \"centre-left\" party.\n\nLeader of the Opposition (1991-1996)\nAfter several years of autocratic rule, widespread protests and strikes had paralysed the economy. Government officers refused to follow orders and resigned. Members of the Bangladesh Rifles laid down their weapons instead of firing on protestors, and curfew was openly violated. Hasina worked with Khaleda Zia in organizing opposition to Ershad. A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted Ershad from power when he resigned in favor of his vice president, Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Chief Justice of the Bangladesh Supreme Court. The caretaker government, headed by Ahmed, administered a general election for the parliament. The BNP, led by Khaleda Zia, won a general majority, and Hasina's Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party. Of the three constituencies Hasina contested, she lost in two and won in one. Accepting defeat, she offered her resignation as the party president but stayed on at the request of party leaders.\n\nFirst premiership (1996-2001)\nThe Awami League, with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling BNP refused to act on these demands.\n\nLeader of the Opposition (2001-2008)\nThe Awami League MPs were irregular in attending parliament during the following period. In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary Abdul Jalil that the government would fall before 30 April 2004.\n\nAssassination attempt (2004)\nDuring her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased. MP Ahsanullah Master died after he was shot in May 2004. This was followed by a grenade attack on 21 August on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 24 party supporters, including Ivy Rahman, party women's secretary. In October 2018, a special court gave verdicts in two cases filed over the incident; the court ruled that it was a well-orchestrated plan, executed through abuse of state power, and all the accused, including BNP Senior Vice-Chairman Tarique Rahman (in absentia) and former top intelligence officials, were found guilty. The court prescribed various punishments. SAMS Kibria, Hasina's close advisor and former finance minister, was assassinated that year (2004) in a grenade attack in Sylhet.\n\nLogi Boitha Movement\nIn October 2006, Sheikh Hasina and Awami League launched the Logi Boitha Movement, where thousands of Awami League workers started occupying different streets of Dhaka with boathooks and oars for several days. This resulted in a number of casualties, vandalisms, lootings, and soaring prices of daily commodities.\n\nDetention during military intervention (2006-2008)\nThe months preceding the planned 22 January 2007 elections were filled with political unrest and controversy. Following the end of Khaleda Zia's government in October 2006, there were protests and strikes, during which 40 people were killed in the following month, over uncertainty about who would head the Caretaker Government. The caretaker government had difficulty bringing all parties to the table. The AL and its allies protested and alleged that the caretaker government favored the BNP.\n\nSecond premiership (2009-2024)\nOn 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to contest the 2008 general election scheduled for 29 December. She decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the banner of the \"Grand Alliance\" with the Jatiya Party, led by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, as its main partner. On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021.\n\nSecond term (2009-2014)\nOn 6 November 2008, Hasina returned to Bangladesh to contest the 2008 general election scheduled for 29 December. She decided to participate in the parliamentary election under the banner of the \"Grand Alliance\" with the Jatiya Party, led by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, as its main partner. On 11 December 2008, Hasina formally announced her party's election manifesto during a news conference and vowed to build a \"Digital Bangladesh\" by 2021.\n\nThird term (2014-2019)\nHasina secured a second-consecutive term in office with her ruling Awami League and its Grand Alliance allies, winning the 2014 general election by a landslide. The election was boycotted by leading opposition parties due to unfair conditions and a lack of non-partisan administration to conduct elections. As a result, the AL-led Grand Alliance won 267 seats out of which 153 were uncontested, surpassing its 2008 poll success—when it secured 263 parliamentary seats. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has run Bangladesh since 2009 and won 288 seats in this election. One of the leading opposition parties accused it of using stuffed ballot boxes. The election was boycotted by major opposition parties including the BNP.\n\nFourth term (2019-2024)\nHasina won her third consecutive term, her fourth overall, when her Awami League won 288 of the 300 parliamentary seats. The leader of the main opposition alliance, Kamal Hossain, declared the vote \"farcical\" and rejected the results. Before the election, Human Rights Watch and other rights organizations had accused the government of creating an intimidating environment for the opposition. The New York Times editorial board described the election as farcical, the editorial stated that it was likely Hasina would have won without vote-rigging and questioned why she did so.\n\nFifth term (2024)\nIn January 2024, Hasina won her fourth consecutive term when her party, the Awami League, won 224 of the 300 parliamentary seats amidst a low voter turnout in an election boycotted by the main opposition. She was inaugurated on 11 January.\n\nResignation and flight from Bangladesh\nHasina resigned on 5 August 2024, as large crowds of demonstrators surrounded the Prime Minister's residence. Her resignation was announced by General Waker-uz-Zaman, the Chief of the Army Staff. Later that day, Hasina fled to India in a chaotic departure, first by car, then by helicopter, and finally by plane. She left with no resignation speech.\n\nPost-premiership\nAs of 10 September 2024, Hasina is facing 152 cases, which include 135 for murder, 7 for crimes against humanity and genocide, 3 for abduction, 6 for attempted murder, and 1 for the attack on a BNP procession. These cases include other former government officials—Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Transport and Bridges Minister and concurrent Awami League secretary-general Obaidul Quader, and others. The International Crimes Tribunal opened an investigation on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against her and nine senior government and Awami League officials over their role in the crackdown on the protests following a petition by the father of a killed student. The BNP requested India to extradite Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh for prosecution against the cases registered on her.\n\nElectoral history\nThe Padma Bridge graft scandal involved the ruling Awami League government that allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, a large amount of money from the Canadian construction company SNC-Lavalin. The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and a Canadian court subsequently dismissed the case.\n\nReception\nThe Padma Bridge graft scandal involved the ruling Awami League government that allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, a large amount of money from the Canadian construction company SNC-Lavalin. The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and a Canadian court subsequently dismissed the case.\n\nCriticisms and Controversies\nThe July massacre 2024 was one of the most violent crackdowns in Bangladesh's history, ordered by Sheikh Hasina's government to suppress a student-led protest. The protest began as a peaceful demonstration demanding reforms to the education system, but it quickly escalated into a nationwide movement. On July 15, 2024, security forces, including the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police, opened fire on unarmed students, many of whom were between the ages of 5 to 30 years old.\n\nElection Manipulation\nSheikh Hasina's government has faced repeated allegations of manipulating elections to maintain power. The 2014 general election, boycotted by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led to a one-sided result, with the ruling Awami League winning most seats uncontested. Similar accusations surfaced in the 2018 election, with widespread reports of vote rigging and obstruction of opposition voters.\n\nSuppression of Opposition and Media\nUnder Hasina's government, opposition leaders, particularly from the BNP, have been frequently arrested or harassed. The imprisonment of BNP leader Khaleda Zia on corruption charges is seen by many as a politically motivated move to weaken the opposition. Hasina's government has also cracked down on media freedom, using laws like the Digital Security Act to detain journalists and activists critical of the regime.\n\nExtrajudicial Arrests and Disappearances\nHuman rights groups have condemned Sheikh Hasina's government for its use of midnight arrests and enforced disappearances, particularly targeting political opponents, activists, and journalists. Security forces like the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) are accused of abducting individuals from their homes during the night, many of whom were never seen again. Victims of these disappearances often included opposition members or activists who were critical of the regime. These practices have led to international outcry, with the United States imposing sanctions on RAB in 2021 for its involvement in human rights violations.\n\nMoney Laundering and Allegations of Corruption in Infrastructure Projects\nSheikh Hasina's government has been accused of corruption and money laundering, especially in relation to large infrastructure projects such as the Padma Bridge and Dhaka Metro Rail. In 2012, the World Bank withdrew its funding from the Padma Bridge project, citing allegations of a conspiracy to commit corruption involving senior government officials. Though the charges were later dismissed in a Canadian court, critics argue that corruption still plagued the project. Similarly, the Dhaka Metro Rail project has faced accusations of cost inflation and kickbacks involving government officials, further fueling concerns of misuse of state funds.\n\nRenaming of Public Institutions and Allegations of Dynastic Politics\nA prominent point of criticism during Sheikh Hasina's tenure has been the renaming of infrastructure, institutions, and public spaces in honor of her family members, particularly her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh. Major projects, such as the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, have either been renamed or established in his name. This practice has also extended to other family members, prompting critics to accuse Hasina of fostering a cult of personality and reinforcing dynastic politics.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1968, Hasina married MA Wazed Miah (1942-2009), a Bangladeshi physicist, writer, and chairman of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. They have a son, Sajeeb Wazed, and a daughter, Saima Wazed. Saima's father-in-law is a former minister of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment and LGRD, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain. Hasina's only living sibling, Sheikh Rehana, served as the adviser of Tungipara upazila unit Awami League in Gopalganj in 2017. Hasina's niece (and Sheikh Rehana's daughter) is Tulip Siddiq, a British Labour Party politician and elected Member of Parliament and City Minister.\n\nBibliography\n\nHonours and awards\n\nHonorary

He spent much of his youth performing magic on the streets of Chicago, New York, St Louis, and New Orleans before landing in California at the age of 16. After moving to Los Angeles, he joined the Dante Magic Club and worked as a street magician in San Francisco when he was 17. He attended Buena Park High School before graduating from North Hollywood High School in 1970 as class valedictorian. After high school, he attended Fullerton College.\n\nAnderson's early life was marked by a strong interest in magic, and he spent much of his youth honing his skills as a street magician. His performances in various cities across the United States helped him develop a unique style and charisma that would serve him well in his future acting career.\n\n**Career**\n\nAnderson's many appearances on Saturday Night Live during the show's seventh, eighth, and ninth seasons, as well as hosting an episode on the show's tenth season, led to his role as Harry \"The Hat\" Gittes on several seasons of the television sitcom Cheers. His portrayal of the lovable and eccentric character earned him critical acclaim and a loyal fan base.\n\nAnderson's success on Cheers eventually led to his role as Judge Harry Stone on the sitcom Night Court. The show, which premiered in 1984, was a huge success and ran for nine seasons, earning Anderson an Emmy nomination for his performance. His character, Judge Stone, was a wise and compassionate judge who often found himself at odds with the more conservative members of the court.\n\nIn addition to his work on Night Court and Cheers, Anderson appeared in numerous other television specials and shows, including 12 appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He was a versatile actor who was comfortable in a variety of roles, from comedy to drama.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAnderson was a longtime fan of singer Mel Tormé, and his character Judge Stone on Night Court was also a Tormé fan. The singer appeared on the sitcom six times, and Anderson was among those who delivered eulogies at his funeral in 1999. Night Court creator Reinhold Weege said that Anderson and his character both being Tormé fans was completely coincidental.\n\nAnderson's love of music and magic was evident in his personal life as well. He was a talented musician and enjoyed playing the piano and singing. His sense of humor and wit were also evident in his personal life, as he was known to be a witty and charming individual.\n\n**Death**\n\nIn late January 2018, Anderson had a bout of influenza and subsequently suffered several strokes. On April 16, 2018, at the age of 65, he died in his sleep of a stroke due to influenza and heart disease at his home in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nAnderson's death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from fans and fellow actors. He was remembered as a talented and versatile actor who brought joy and laughter to millions of people through his performances.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Film:\n\t+ \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" (1976)\n\t+ \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1992)\n\t+ \"Hoosiers\" (1986)\n* Television:\n\t+ \"Saturday Night Live\" (1977-1980)\n\t+ \"Cheers\" (1982-1987)\n\t+ \"Night Court\" (1984-1992)\n\t+ \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (1980-1987)\n* Video Games:\n\t+ \"Night Court: The Game\" (1990)\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n* Harry Anderson at IMDb\n* Harry Anderson at Find a Grave", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Harry_Anderson\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAnderson was born October 14, 1952, in Newport, Rhode Island [2] He spent much of his youth performing magic on the streets of Chicago, New York, St Louis and New Orleans before landing in California at the age of 16 [3] [4] After moving to Los Angeles, [4] he joined the Dante Magic Club and worked as a street magician in San Francisco when he was 17 [5] He attended Buena Park High School before graduating from North Hollywood High School in 1970 as class valedictorian [1] [6] After high school, he attended Fullerton College [7] [8] From 1971 to 1976, he lived in Ashland, Oregon, performing magic and working with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival [9] [10]\n\n\nCareer\nAnderson's many appearances on Saturday Night Live during the show's seventh, eighth, and ninth seasons, as well as hosting an episode on the show's tenth season, led to his role as Harry \"The Hat\" Gittes on several seasons of the television sitcom Cheers, and eventually as Judge Harry Stone on the sitcom Night Court [11] He went on to appear in other television specials and shows, including 12 appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson [12]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAnderson was a longtime fan of singer Mel Tormé, and his character Judge Stone on Night Court was also a Tormé fan; the singer appeared on the sitcom six times [12] Night Court creator Reinhold Weege said that Anderson and his character both being Tormé fans was completely coincidental [25] Anderson was among those who delivered eulogies at the singer's funeral in 1999 [26]\n\n\nDeath\nIn late January 2018, Anderson had a bout of influenza and subsequently suffered several strokes On April 16, 2018, at age 65, he died in his sleep of a stroke due to influenza and heart disease at his home in Asheville, North Carolina [29] [5] [11] [12]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Princess Muna Al-Hussein (born Toni Avril Gardiner) [5] [6] He is the namesake of his paternal great-grandfather, Abdullah I, who founded modern Jordan [7] [8] Abdullah's dynasty, the Hashemites, ruled Mecca for over 700 years—from the 10th century until the House of Saud conquered Mecca in 1925—and have ruled Jordan since 1921 [9] [10] The Hashemites are the oldest ruling dynasty in the Muslim world [11] According to family tradition, Abdullah is the 41st-generation agnatic descendant of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the fourth Rashidun caliph [5] [12]\n\n\nMilitary career\nHe began his military career at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England in 1980, while he was a training officer in the Jordanian Armed Forces [5] [18] After Sandhurst, Abdullah was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Army and served a year in Britain and West Germany as a troop commander in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (now the Light Dragoons) [5]\n\n\nReign\nAbdullah joined his father on a number of missions, including meetings abroad with Soviet and American leaders [22] He was occasionally King Hussein's regent during the 1990s but this duty was mainly performed by Hussein's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan [19] Abdullah led his father's delegation to Moscow for talks in 1987 [22] He frequently visited the Pentagon in Washington, where he lobbied for increased military assistance to Jordan [22] The prince joined his father on trips to visit Hafez Al-Assad in Damascus and Saddam Hussein in Baghdad (before the 1990 Gulf War) [22] Abdullah commanded military exercises during Israeli military officials' visits to Jordan in 1997, and was sent to hand-deliver a message to Muammar Gaddafi in 1998 [22]\n\n\nAccession and enthronement\nAbdullah joined his father on a number of missions, including meetings abroad with Soviet and American leaders [22] He was occasionally King Hussein's regent during the 1990s but this duty was mainly performed by Hussein's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan [19] Abdullah led his father's delegation to Moscow for talks in 1987 [22] He frequently visited the Pentagon in

Gulf War) [22] Abdullah commanded military exercises during Israeli military officials' visits to Jordan in 1997, and was sent to hand-deliver a message to Muammar Gaddafi in 1998 [22]\n\n\nFirst year\nAs king, Abdullah retains wider executive and legislative authority than is normally the case for a constitutional monarch He is head of state and commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces and appoints the prime minister and the directors of security agencies [26] The prime minister is free to choose his cabinet [27] The Parliament of Jordan consists of two chambers: the appointed Senate and the elected House of Representatives, which serve as a check on the government However, according to Freedom House, most seats in the House are held by pro-palace independents, and the crown's authority is such that it is extremely difficult for a party to win power solely via the ballot box [26] [27] The Senate is appointed by the king, and the House of Representatives is directly elected [27]\n\n\n2000s\n\nOn 23 June 2000, while vacationing in the Greek Islands, Abdullah received a phone call from the director of Mukhabarat (the country's Intelligence Directorate) warning of an assassination attempt against him by Al-Qaeda [34] The plot was to target Abdullah and his family's rented yacht with explosives [34] The September 11 attacks in 2001 on American targets were fiercely condemned by Abdullah [35] Jordan responded quickly to American requests for assistance, enacting counterterrorism legislation and maintaining a high level of vigilance [35] The country's Mukhabarat foiled similar plots the following year against Western targets, including the American and British embassies in Lebanon [36]\n\n2010s\nThe Tunisian Revolution in December 2010 (which unseated that country's president) brought Egyptians into the streets, and by January 2011 they overthrew president Hosni Mubarak [54] Protests in other Arab countries soon followed, resulting in civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen [54] In Jordan, opposition groups including the Muslim Brotherhood, leftists, and retired army generals protested throughout the country [55] By 1 February 2011, domestic unrest prompted Abdullah to sack Samir Rifai's government and pledge to follow a democratic trajectory [55]\n\n\nArab Spring 2010–2014\nThe Tunisian Revolution in December 2010 (which unseated that country's president) brought Egyptians into the streets, and by January 2011 they overthrew president Hosni Mubarak [54] Protests in other Arab countries soon followed, resulting in civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen [54] In Jordan, opposition groups including the Muslim Brotherhood, leftists, and retired army generals protested throughout the country [55] By 1 February 2011, domestic unrest prompted Abdullah to sack Samir Rifai's government and pledge to follow a democratic trajectory [55]\n\n\nWest Bank\nIn December 2012, Abdullah was the first head of state to visit the West Bank after a United Nations General Assembly vote upgraded the Palestinian Authority to a nonmember observer state [63] Jordan sees an independent Palestinian state, with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest [64] Jordan, the only country bordering the West Bank other than Israel, ruled it after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and lost in the 1967 Six-Day War [63] Its annexation of the West Bank was not recognized, and in 1988 the kingdom ceded its claim to the territory [63]\n\n\nRegional turmoil 2014–2019\nI was asked many questions by Jordanians that were getting just as frustrated seeing that 20 per cent of their country are now Syrian refugees, the impact it has on jobs, on property, on unemployment And they ask me, \"stop the Syrians coming into the country\", and I say \"How?\" When you have a mother, a pregnant mother with a child in the hand trying to cross the border, how are we going to stop her? Do we sort of point bayonets at these people that are running away from horrible and threatening lives? There is a level of humanity that we have to reach out to each other.\n\n\n2020s\nIn an interview with Der Spiegel in May 2020, Abdullah criticized Donald Trump's plans for peace in the Middle East including Israel annexing parts of the West Bank He stated, \"The two-state solution is the only way for us to be able to move forward\", and noted a possible Israeli annexation of the West Bank causes conflicts [103] \nIn October 2020, Omar Razzaz resigned from his position due to the criticism of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic In addition, Abdullah dissolved the parliament and instructed his chief policy adviser, Bishr Al-Khasawneh, to form a new government as the new Prime Minister [104] After Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, Abdullah was the first Arab leader to congratulate Biden for his victory [105]\n\n\nAdministrative reforms\nKing Abdullah proposed significant economic reforms to the country during the first decade of his reign [126] Jordan, a relatively-small, semi-arid, almost-landlocked country, has one of the smallest economies in the region; its GDP was about $39 billion in 2016 [127] [126] Insufficient natural resources, especially in water and oil (unlike its neighbors) have given the kingdom chronic government debt, unemployment and poverty [126] which led to a dependence on foreign aid from its Western and Arab allies in the Persian Gulf region [126] Jordan embarked on an aggressive economic liberalization program when Abdullah was crowned in an effort to stimulate the economy and raise the standard of living, and its economy has improved under his reign [126] He has been credited with attracting foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority and Jordan's flourishing information and communications technology (ICT) sector [128] [129] Abdullah set up five other special economic zones: Irbid, Ajloun, Mafraq, Ma'an and the Dead Sea [128] As a result of these reforms, Jordan's economic growth doubled (to 8% annually) between 2004 and 2008 compared with the latter half of the 1990s [126] It also led to a steady increase in foreign investment by the West and the Persian Gulf countries [130]\n\n\nEconomic\nKing Abdullah proposed significant economic reforms to the country during the first decade of his reign [126] Jordan, a relatively-small, semi-arid, almost-landlocked country, has one of the smallest economies in the region;

this prompted Abdullah to urge the government to formulate a 10-year plan (2015–2025) to diversify the kingdom's energy sources [172] [173]\n\n\nReligious affairs\nOur faith, like yours, commands mercy, peace and tolerance It upholds, as yours does, the equal human dignity of every person – men and women, neighbours and strangers Those outlaws of Islam who deny these truths are vastly outnumbered by the ocean of believers – 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide In fact, these terrorists have made the world's Muslims their greatest target We will not allow them to hijack our faith.\n\n\nSuccessor\nOn 28 November 2004, Abdullah removed the title of crown prince from his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, whom he had appointed on 7 February 1999 in accordance with their father's advice [198] In a letter to Hamzah read on Jordanian state television, Abdullah said: \"Your holding this symbolic position has restrained your freedom and hindered our entrusting you with certain responsibilities that you are fully qualified to undertake.\" [198] Although no successor to the title was named at that time, the king was expected to appoint his son and heir apparent, Prince Hussein, crown prince [198] Hussein received the title on 2 July 2009 [199]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKing Abdullah met Rania Al-Yassin at a dinner party in January 1993 On 10 June 1993, they were married at Zahran Palace [200] King Abdullah and Queen Rania have four children: \n\n\nInterests\nAbdullah has listed skydiving, motorcycling, water sports and collecting ancient weapons as his interests and hobbies, and is a fan of the science-fiction series Star Trek [21] [81] In 1996, he appeared briefly in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \"Investigations\", in a non-speaking role [204]\n\n\nWealth\nAbdullah owns an international network of real estate properties, valued in excess of $100 million His ownership of the properties was disguised through a series of offshore companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands Abdullah's property empire was disclosed in the Pandora Papers leak, which revealed ownership of three contiguous oceanfront estates in the Point Dume area of Malibu, [211] [3] and properties in Washington, D.C., London and Ascot [212] His lawyers denied any misuse of public funds or tax evasion and stated that they were bought from the monarch's private wealth and through offshore companies for security and privacy reasons [213] A 2022 Credit Suisse leak revealed that Abdullah owned six secret accounts, including one whose balance exceeded $224 million A Royal Court statement said that the funds were a result of selling an Airbus A340 plane that belonged to his father the late King Hussein for $212 million, and that it was replaced with a smaller, less costly Gulfstream aircraft [4] [214]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nOfficial\n\n\nHonours\nOfficial\n\n\nNational honours\nOfficial\n\n\nForeign honours\nOfficial\n\n\nHonorary degrees\nOfficial\n\n\nHonorary military appointments\nOfficial\n\n\nAwards\nOfficial\n\n\nAncestors\nOfficial\n\n\nWritings\nOfficial\n\n\nSee also\nOfficial\n\n\nNotes\nOfficial\n\n\nReferences\nOfficial\n\n\nBibliography\nOfficial\n\n\nExternal links\nOfficial\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Abdullah II of Jordan**\n\nAbdullah II bin Al Hussein is the current King of Jordan, having reigned since 1999.

Do we sort of point bayonets at these people that are running away from horrible and threatening lives? There is a level of humanity that we have to reach out to each other.\n\n**2020s**\n\nIn an interview with Der Spiegel in May 2020, Abdullah criticized Donald Trump's plans for peace in the Middle East, including Israel's annexation of parts of the West Bank. He stated, \"The two-state solution is the only way for us to be able to move forward\", and noted that a possible Israeli annexation of the West Bank causes conflicts. In October 2020, Omar Razzaz resigned from his position due to the criticism of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, Abdullah dissolved the parliament and instructed his chief policy adviser, Bishr Al-Khasawneh, to form a new government as the new Prime Minister. After Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, Abdullah was the first Arab leader to congratulate Biden for his victory.\n\n**Administrative Reforms**\n\nKing Abdullah proposed significant economic reforms to the country during the first decade of his reign. Jordan, a relatively small, semi-arid, almost-landlocked country, has one of the smallest economies in the region, with a GDP of about $39 billion in 2016. Insufficient natural resources, especially in water and oil, have given the kingdom chronic government debt, unemployment, and poverty. This led to a dependence on foreign aid from its Western and Arab allies in the Persian Gulf region. Jordan embarked on an aggressive economic liberalization program when Abdullah was crowned in an effort to stimulate the economy and raise the standard of living, and its economy has improved under his reign. He has been credited with attracting foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships, and providing the foundation for the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority and Jordan's flourishing information and communications technology (ICT) sector. Abdullah set up five other special economic zones: Irbid, Ajloun, Mafraq, Ma'an, and the Dead Sea. As a result of these reforms, Jordan's economic growth doubled (to 8 percent annually) between 2004 and 2008 compared with the latter half of the 1990s.\n\n**Economic**\n\nKing Abdullah proposed significant economic reforms to the country during the first decade of his reign.

As a result of these reforms, Jordan's economic growth doubled (to 8 percent annually) between 2004 and 2008 compared with the latter half of the 1990s.\n\n**Political**\n\nAbdullah was criticized during his early years for focusing on economic, rather than political reform. A committee was formed in February 2005 to formulate a blueprint for political reform in the country for the next decade. This National Agenda, finalized about nine months later, was never implemented. It included incorporating proportional representation into general elections, improving the judicial branch, and respect for human rights, and tackling issues related to employment, welfare, education, and infrastructure. The Agenda was reportedly never implemented due to conservative opposition. After the Arab Spring, a new election law in 2012 was enacted and used in the 2013 elections. It incorporated elements of proportional representation, and 27 of the 150 House of Representatives members could be elected accordingly. A number of political reforms were undertaken to curtail some of the king's powers, including amending about one-third of the constitution, establishing a constitutional court, and the Independent Election Commission, and improvements to laws governing human rights and freedom of speech and assembly.\n\n**Military**\n\nDue to his military background, Abdullah believes in a powerful military and has followed a \"quality over quantity\" policy. During the first year of his reign, he established the King Abdullah Design and Development Bureau (now Jordan Design and Development Bureau), whose goal is to \"provide an indigenous capability for the supply of scientific and technical services to the Jordanian Armed Forces.\" The company manufactures a wide variety of military products, which are presented at the biennial international Special Operations Forces Exhibition (SOFEX)—Abdullah is SOFEX's patron. Abdullah modernized the army, leading Jordan to acquire advanced weaponry and increase and enhance its F-16 fighter-jet fleet. The King occasionally trains with the Jordanian army in live ammunition military drills.\n\n**Energy Sector**\n\nVandalism of the Egyptian pipeline supplying Jordan strained the country's electrical company, whose debt increased substantially; this prompted Abdullah to urge the government to formulate a 10-year plan (2015–2025) to diversify the kingdom's energy sources.\n\n**Religious Affairs**\n\nOur faith, like yours, commands mercy, peace, and tolerance. It upholds, as yours does, the equal human dignity of every person—men and women, neighbors, and strangers. Those outlaws of Islam who deny these truths are vastly outnumbered by the ocean of believers—1.6 billion Muslims worldwide. In fact, these terrorists have made the world's Muslims their greatest target. We will not allow them to hijack our faith.\n\n**Successor**\n\nOn 28 November 2004, Abdullah removed the title of crown prince from his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, whom he had appointed on 7 February 1999 in accordance with their father's advice. In a letter to Hamzah read on Jordanian state television, Abdullah said: \"Your holding this symbolic position has restrained your freedom and hindered our entrusting you with certain responsibilities that you are fully qualified to undertake.\" Although no successor to the title was named at that time, the king was expected to appoint his son and heir apparent, Prince Hussein, crown prince. Hussein received the title on 2 July 2009.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKing Abdullah met Rania Al-Yassin at a dinner party in January 1993. On 10 June 1993, they were married at Zahran Palace. King Abdullah and Queen Rania have four children:\n\n**Interests**\n\nAbdullah has listed skydiving, motorcycling, water sports, and collecting ancient weapons as his interests and hobbies, and is a fan of the science-fiction series Star Trek. In 1996, he appeared briefly in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \"Investigations,\" in a non-speaking role.\n\n**Wealth**\n\nAbdullah owns an international network of real estate properties, valued in excess of $100 million. His ownership of the properties was disguised through a series of offshore companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Abdullah's property empire was disclosed in the Pandora Papers leak, which revealed ownership of three contiguous oceanfront estates in the Point Dume area of Malibu, and properties in Washington, D.C., London, and Ascot. His lawyers denied any misuse of public funds or tax evasion and stated that they were bought from the monarch's private wealth and through offshore companies for security and privacy reasons. A 2022 Credit Suisse leak revealed that Abdullah owned six secret accounts, including one whose balance exceeded $224 million. A Royal Court statement said that the funds were a result of selling an Airbus A340 plane that belonged to his father the late King Hussein for $212 million, and that it was replaced with a smaller, less costly Gulfstream aircraft.\n\n**Honors and Awards**\n\nKing Abdullah received numerous honors and awards, including:\n\n*   **Honorary degrees:** Abdullah received honorary degrees from several universities, including Yale University, the University of Oxford, and the University of Cambridge.\n*   **Honorary military appointments:** Abdullah was appointed an honorary general in the British Army, the United States Army, and the French Army.\n*   **Awards:** Abdullah received several awards, including the Grand Master of the Order of the Collar of the Order of the Golden Spur, the Grand Master of the Order of the Collar of the Order of Pius IX, and the Grand Master of the Order of the Collar of the Order of the Golden Spur.\n\n**Ancestors**\n\nAbdullah's ancestors include:\n\n*   **Abdullah I:** The founder of modern Jordan and the great-grandfather of Abdullah II.\n*   **Talal I:** The father of Abdullah I and the great-great-grandfather of Abdullah II.\n*   **Faisal I:** The great-grandfather of Abdullah II and the founder of the Hashemite dynasty.\n*   **Sharif Hussein bin Ali:** The great-great-grandfather of Abdullah II and the leader of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**Writings**\n\nAbdullah wrote several books, including:\n\n*   **\"The Jordanian Dream\":** A book about the history and culture of Jordan.\n*   **\"The Hashemite Dynasty\":** A book about the history of the Hashemite dynasty.\n*   **\"The Arab Revolt\":** A book about the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**See Also**\n\n*   **Jordan:** A country in the Middle East and the current home of Abdullah II.\n*   **Hashemite dynasty:** A dynasty that ruled Mecca for over 700 years and has ruled Jordan since 1921.\n*   **Abdullah I:** The founder of modern Jordan and the great-grandfather of Abdullah II.\n*   **Abdullah II:** The current King of Jordan and the 41st-generation descendant of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Abdullah_II_of_Jordan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nAbdullah was born on 30 January 1962 at Palestine Hospital in Al Abdali, Amman, to King Hussein and Hussein's British-born second wife, Princess Muna Al-Hussein (born Toni Avril Gardiner) [5] [6] He is the namesake of his paternal great-grandfather, Abdullah I, who founded modern Jordan [7] [8] Abdullah's dynasty, the Hashemites, ruled Mecca for over 700 years—from the 10th century until the House of Saud conquered Mecca in 1925—and have ruled Jordan since 1921 [9] [10] The Hashemites are the oldest ruling dynasty in the Muslim world [11] According to family tradition, Abdullah is the 41st-generation agnatic descendant of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and her husband, Ali, the fourth Rashidun caliph [5] [12]\n\n\nMilitary career\nHe began his military career at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England in 1980, while he was a training officer in the Jordanian Armed Forces [5] [18] After Sandhurst, Abdullah was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Army and served a year in Britain and West Germany as a troop commander in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (now the Light Dragoons) [5]\n\n\nReign\nAbdullah joined his father on a number of missions, including meetings abroad with Soviet and American leaders [22] He was occasionally King Hussein's regent during the 1990s but this duty was mainly performed by Hussein's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan [19] Abdullah led his father's delegation to Moscow for talks in 1987 [22] He frequently visited the Pentagon in Washington, where he lobbied for increased military assistance to Jordan [22] The prince joined his father on trips to visit Hafez Al-Assad in Damascus and Saddam Hussein in Baghdad (before the 1990 Gulf War) [22] Abdullah commanded military exercises during Israeli military officials' visits to Jordan in 1997, and was sent to hand-deliver a message to Muammar Gaddafi in 1998 [22]\n\n\nAccession and enthronement\nAbdullah joined his father on a number of missions, including meetings abroad with Soviet and American leaders [22] He was occasionally King Hussein's regent during the 1990s but this duty was mainly performed by Hussein's younger brother, Crown Prince Hassan [19] Abdullah led his father's delegation to Moscow for talks in 1987 [22] He frequently visited

(before the 1990 Gulf War) [22] Abdullah commanded military exercises during Israeli military officials' visits to Jordan in 1997, and was sent to hand-deliver a message to Muammar Gaddafi in 1998 [22]\n\n\nFirst year\nAs king, Abdullah retains wider executive and legislative authority than is normally the case for a constitutional monarch He is head of state and commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces and appoints the prime minister and the directors of security agencies [26] The prime minister is free to choose his cabinet [27] The Parliament of Jordan consists of two chambers: the appointed Senate and the elected House of Representatives, which serve as a check on the government However, according to Freedom House, most seats in the House are held by pro-palace independents, and the crown's authority is such that it is extremely difficult for a party to win power solely via the ballot box [26] [27] The Senate is appointed by the king, and the House of Representatives is directly elected [27]\n\n\n2000s\n\nOn 23 June 2000, while vacationing in the Greek Islands, Abdullah received a phone call from the director of Mukhabarat (the country's Intelligence Directorate) warning of an assassination attempt against him by Al-Qaeda [34] The plot was to target Abdullah and his family's rented yacht with explosives [34] The September 11 attacks in 2001 on American targets were fiercely condemned by Abdullah [35] Jordan responded quickly to American requests for assistance, enacting counterterrorism legislation and maintaining a high level of vigilance [35] The country's Mukhabarat foiled similar plots the following year against Western targets, including the American and British embassies in Lebanon [36]\n\n2010s\nThe Tunisian Revolution in December 2010 (which unseated that country's president) brought Egyptians into the streets, and by January 2011 they overthrew president Hosni Mubarak [54] Protests in other Arab countries soon followed, resulting in civil wars in Libya, Syria and Yemen [54] In Jordan, opposition groups including the Muslim Brotherhood, leftists, and retired army generals protested throughout the country [55] By 1 February 2011, domestic unrest prompted Abdullah to sack Samir Rifai's government and pledge to follow a democratic trajectory [55]\n\n\nArab Spring 2010–2014\nThe Tunisian Revolution in

[55] By 1 February 2011, domestic unrest prompted Abdullah to sack Samir Rifai's government and pledge to follow a democratic trajectory [55]\n\n\nWest Bank\nIn December 2012, Abdullah was the first head of state to visit the West Bank after a United Nations General Assembly vote upgraded the Palestinian Authority to a nonmember observer state [63] Jordan sees an independent Palestinian state, with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest [64] Jordan, the only country bordering the West Bank other than Israel, ruled it after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and lost in the 1967 Six-Day War [63] Its annexation of the West Bank was not recognized, and in 1988 the kingdom ceded its claim to the territory [63]\n\n\nRegional turmoil 2014–2019\nI was asked

{"title": "Neera_Tanden", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nNeera Tanden was born on September 10, 1970, [1] [2] in Bedford, Massachusetts, [3] to immigrant parents from India [4] She has a brother, Raj Her parents divorced when she was five, after which Tanden's mother, Maya, was on welfare for nearly two years before obtaining a job as a travel agent [5] [6] When she was nominated to lead the OMB in 2020, Tanden stated she was \"mindful that my path in life would never have been possible without budgetary choices that reflected our nation’s values\" [7]\n\n\nCareer\nTanden has worked on domestic policy on Capitol Hill, in think tanks, and for various Democratic senatorial and presidential campaigns.\n\n\nWork with the Clintons\nTanden has been regarded as a Clinton loyalist [11] and personal friend of Hillary Clinton, [12] whose professional life has been significantly defined by her work with the Clintons [13] The New Republic has described Tanden as Hillary Clinton's closest policy adviser [14]\n\n\n2008 Obama general election campaign\nAfter Barack Obama was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, Tanden was one of the first, and also one of the few former-Clinton campaign staffers to join his team [32] She was domestic policy director for his successful general election campaign [21] [33]\n\n\nObama administration\nTanden served in the Obama administration as senior adviser to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services She helped to draft the administration's health care legislation, including work specific to its proposed, but later withdrawn, public option [34] [35] [36] [37] She also negotiated with Congress and stakeholders on several provisions of the bill [32] She has been described as one of the \"key architects\" of the Affordable Care Act [38]\n\n\nCenter for American Progress\nIn 2003, Tanden had a central role in the founding of the Center for American Progress (CAP) [39] Tanden worked as Senior Vice President for Domestic Policy, while also serving as Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and, starting in 2010, as Chief Operating Officer [15]\n\n\nOffice of Management and Budget nomination\nOn November 30, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden introduced Tanden as his nominee for Director of the Office of Management and Budget [47] Immediately afterwards, Tanden deleted over 1,000 of her previous tweets, [48] and changed her Twitter bio from \"progressive\" to \"liberal\" [49] During the confirmation hearing, Tanden apologized for several of her tweets attacking Republican senators, including tweets calling Susan Collins \"the worst\", comparing Ted Cruz to vampires, and using the nickname \"Moscow Mitch\" for Mitch McConnell and comparing him to Lord Voldemort [50] Senator John Cornyn described Tanden as \"radioactive\" in contrast to other Biden nominees he felt were more acceptable [51] Senator John Kennedy stated that she \"called Senator Sanders everything but an ignorant slut\", a reference to a 1970s Saturday Night Live catch phrase [52] [53] NPR described her as \"Biden's most controversial Cabinet pick\" [54]\n\n\nSenior Advisor to the President\nTanden was appointed as a senior advisor to President Biden on May 14, 2021 [71] In this role, Tanden will plan for possible policy changes awaiting a Supreme Court decision on Republican challenges to Obamacare and will initiate a review of the United States Digital Service [71] According to analysis by Politico, Tanden may have more influence in the role of senior advisor than she would have had as OMB Director, as this role will allow her to be included in daily presidential briefings [72]\n\n\nStaff secretary\nIn October 2021, Tanden was named President Biden's staff secretary, reporting to Ron Klain [73] She will remain a senior advisor in the Biden White House [73]\n\n\nPolitical views\nTanden has been described by The Washington Post as a \"progressive\", [32] by Business Insider as a \"centrist\", [74] and by Vox as \"one of the more liberal members of Clintonland\" [28] She is regarded as a loyalist and confidante of Bill and Hillary Clinton [11] [75] She credits her experiences growing up relying on government assistance as the reason she has entered politics and the motivator of her career [76] She is known for her outspoken and prolific Twitter presence, where she has criticized lawmakers both to her political left and right [77] Senator Bernie Sanders wrote a letter in 2019 accusing Tanden of \"maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas\" [55]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nMuch of Tanden's work relates to healthcare policy in America She worked on the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or \"Obamacare\") during the Obama administration [39] Tanden supports a multi-payer universal healthcare system, [79] [80] and opposes single-payer healthcare, including Medicare for All proposals [81] [82]\n\n\nForeign policy\nTanden has been described as \"hawkish\" In September 2013, Tanden tweeted that \"an unpoliced world is dangerous.\" [87] The Center for American Progress has been described as having close ties to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] In 2016, she met India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi [93] In 2020, however, Tanden criticized Modi's government for permitting a climate of violence against Muslims in India [94]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn 2015, Tanden and CAP criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for engaging in what they called hyper-partisan activity during his trip to Washington, D.C., to lobby against the Obama-backed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action When Netanyahu visited D.C again later in the year, he requested an audience before the left-leaning CAP Tanden agreed to Netanyahu's request, saying it would be hypocritical to do otherwise, adding the event would include a question and answer segment between

of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). She has been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party and has worked closely with several high-profile politicians, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nNeera Tanden was born on September 10, 1970, in Bedford, Massachusetts, to immigrant parents from India. Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and her mother, Maya, was on welfare for nearly two years before obtaining a job as a travel agent. Tanden has spoken publicly about the challenges she faced growing up in a low-income household and has credited her experiences with motivating her to enter politics.\n\n**Career**\n\nTanden has worked on domestic policy on Capitol Hill, in think tanks, and for various Democratic senatorial and presidential campaigns. She has been regarded as a Clinton loyalist and has worked closely with Hillary Clinton on several occasions.\n\n**Work with the Clintons**\n\nTanden has been a long-time supporter of the Clintons and has worked on several of Hillary Clinton's campaigns, including her 2008 presidential campaign. She has been described as Hillary Clinton's closest policy adviser and has been a key player in shaping Clinton's policy positions.\n\n**2008 Obama General Election Campaign**\n\nAfter Barack Obama was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, Tanden was one of the first, and also one of the few former-Clinton campaign staffers to join his team. She was domestic policy director for his successful general election campaign.\n\n**Obama Administration**\n\nTanden served in the Obama administration as senior adviser to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services. She helped to draft the administration's health care legislation, including work specific to its proposed, but later withdrawn, public option. She also negotiated with Congress and stakeholders on several provisions of the bill.\n\n**Center for American Progress**\n\nIn 2003, Tanden had a central role in the founding of the Center for American Progress (CAP). She worked as Senior Vice President for Domestic Policy, while also serving as Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and, starting in 2010, as Chief Operating Officer.\n\n**Office of Management and Budget Nomination**\n\nOn November 30, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden introduced Tanden as his nominee for Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Immediately afterwards, Tanden deleted over 1,000 of her previous tweets, and changed her Twitter bio from \"progressive\" to \"liberal.\" During the confirmation hearing, Tanden apologized for several of her tweets attacking Republican senators, including tweets calling Susan Collins \"the worst,\" comparing Ted Cruz to vampires, and using the nickname \"Moscow Mitch\" for Mitch McConnell and comparing him to Lord Voldemort.\n\n**Senior Advisor to the President**\n\nTanden was appointed as a senior advisor to President Biden on May 14, 2021. In this role, Tanden will plan for possible policy changes awaiting a Supreme Court decision on Republican challenges to Obamacare and will initiate a review of the United States Digital Service. According to analysis by Politico, Tanden may have more influence in the role of senior advisor than she would have had as OMB Director, as this role will allow her to be included in daily presidential briefings.\n\n**Staff Secretary**\n\nIn October 2021, Tanden was named President Biden's staff secretary, reporting to Ron Klain. She will remain a senior advisor in the Biden White House.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nTanden has been described by The Washington Post as a \"progressive,\" by Business Insider as a \"centrist,\" and by Vox as \"one of the more liberal members of Clintonland.\" She is regarded as a loyalist and confidante of Bill and Hillary Clinton. She credits her experiences growing up relying on government assistance as the reason she has entered politics and the motivator of her career.\n\n**Domestic Policy**\n\nMuch of Tanden's work relates to healthcare policy in America. She worked on the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or \"Obamacare\") during the Obama administration. Tanden supports a multi-payer universal healthcare system and opposes single-payer healthcare, including Medicare for All proposals.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nTanden has been described as \"hawkish.\" In September 2013, Tanden tweeted that \"an unpoliced world is dangerous.\" The Center for American Progress has been described as having close ties to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. In 2016, she met India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2020, however, Tanden criticized Modi's government for permitting a climate of violence against Muslims in India.\n\n**Israel**\n\nIn 2015, Tanden and CAP criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for engaging in what they called hyper-partisan activity during his trip to Washington, D.C., to lobby against the Obama-backed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. When Netanyahu visited D.C. again later in the year, he requested an audience before the left-leaning CAP. Tanden agreed to Netanyahu's request, saying it would be hypocritical to do otherwise, adding the event would include a question and answer segment between attendees and the prime minister.\n\n**Libya**\n\nBefore the U.S.–NATO bombing of Libya, Tanden tweeted her support for Gaddafi's removal.\n\n**Syria**\n\nIn September 2013, when President Obama was considering bombing Syria, Tanden tweeted: \"On Syria, while I don't want to be the world's policeman, an unpoliced world is dangerous.

[because] she has managed to be at once boldly shocking and ultimately enigmatic.\" [305] New York Post movie critic David Edelstein attributes Cher's \"top-ranking star quality\" to her ability of projecting \"honesty, rawness and emotionality She wears her vulnerability on her sleeve.\" [305] Jeff Yarbrough of The Advocate wrote that Cher was \"one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping\", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film Silkwood [306]\n\n\nPublic image\nTime magazine's Cady Lang described Cher as a \"cultural phenomenon  [who] has forever changed the way we see celebrity fashion.\" [319] Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing \"hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas, and Cherokee-inspired tunics\" [320] She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy that year [320] Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in a beaded and feathered nude gown designed by Bob Mackie for the cover of Time magazine in 1975; [321] Billboard magazine's Brooke Mazurek described it as \"one of the most recreated and monumental looks of all time.\" [322] Cher first wore the gown to the 1974 Met Gala According to Vogue magazine's André Leon Talley, \"it was really the first time a Hollywood celebrity attended, and it changed everything We are still seeing versions of that look on The Met red carpet 40 years later.\" [322] Billboard wrote that Cher has \"transformed fashion and  [become] one of the most influential style icons in red carpet history\" [322]\n\n\nFashion\nTime magazine's Cady Lang described Cher as a \"cultural phenomenon  [who] has forever changed the way we see celebrity fashion.\" [319] Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing \"hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas, and Cherokee-inspired tunics\" [320] She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy that year [320] Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in a beaded and feathered nude gown designed by Bob Mackie for the cover of Time magazine in 1975; [321] Billboard magazine's Brooke Mazurek described it as \"one of the most recreated and monumental looks of all time.\" [322] Cher first wore the gown to the 1974 Met Gala According to Vogue magazine's André Leon Talley, \"it was really the first time a Hollywood celebrity attended, and it changed everything We are still seeing versions of that look on The Met red carpet 40 years later.\" [322] Billboard wrote that Cher has \"transformed fashion and  [become] one of the most influential style icons in red carpet history\" [322]\n\n\nPhysical appearance\nCher has attracted media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her youthful looks and her tattoos Paddy Calistro of the Los Angeles Times observed that during Cher's rise as a movie star in the 1980s, her \"highly articulated bone structure captured audience attention\", which led to an increased number of medical requests for \"surgically inserted 'cheekbones'\" [332] Journalists have often called Cher the \"poster girl\" of plastic surgery [333] Author Grant McCracken, in his book Transformations: Identity Construction in Contemporary Culture (2008), draws a parallel between Cher's plastic surgeries and the transformations in her career: \"Her plastic surgery is not merely cosmetic It is hyperbolic, extreme, over the top .. Cher has engaged in a transformational technology that is dramatic and irreversible.\" [333] Caroline Ramazanoglu, author of Up Against Foucault: Explorations of Some Tensions Between Foucault and Feminism (1993), wrote that \"Cher's operations have gradually replaced a strong, decidedly 'ethnic' look with a more symmetrical, delicate, 'conventional' .. and ever-youthful version of female beauty .. Her normalised image .. now acts as a standard against which other women will measure, judge, discipline and 'correct' themselves.\" [334] In 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five \"most beautiful women of history\" by creating a life-size statue [335] She was ranked 26th on VH1's list of the \"100 Sexiest Artists\" published in 2002 [336]\n\n\nSocial media\nCher's social media presence has drawn analysis from journalists [342] Time named her \"Twitter's most outspoken (and beloved) commentator\" [319] The New York Times writer Jenna Wortham commended Cher on her social media usage, stating, \"Most celebrities' social-media feeds feel painfully self-aware and thirsty .. In her own way, Cher is an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit and yell (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and be rewarded for it Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye.\" [343] Monica Heisey of The Guardian described Cher's Twitter account as \"a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet\", and remarked, \"While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out.\" [344]\n\n\nAs a gay icon\nThe reverence held for Cher by members of the LGBT community has been attributed to her career accomplishments, her sense of style, and her longevity [345] Cher is considered a gay icon, and has often been imitated by drag queens [346] According to Salon magazine's Thomas Rogers, \" [d]rag queens imitate women like Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Cher because they overcame insult and hardship on their path to success, and because their narratives mirror the pain that many gay men suffer on their way out of the closet\" [346] According to Maclean's magazine's Elio Iannacci, Cher was \"one of the first to bring drag to the masses\" as she hired two drag queens to perform with her at her Las Vegas residency in 1979 [347] Cher's role as a lesbian in the film Silkwood, as well as her transition to dance music and social activism, have further contributed to her becoming a gay icon [348] The NBC sitcom Will & Grace acknowledged Cher's status by making her the idol of gay character Jack McFarland Cher guest-starred as herself twice on the show, in 2000—making the episode \"Gypsies, Tramps and Weed\" (named after her 1971 song \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\") Will & Grace's second-highest rating ever— [349] and 2002 [350] As the mother of a trans man, Cher has also served as a role model for parents of transgender children [351]\n\n\nOther

Foundation supports international projects such as the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, Operation Helmet, and the Children's Craniofacial Association [356]\n\n\nChildren\nBeginning in 1990, Cher served as a donor and as the National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson for the Children's Craniofacial Association, whose mission is to \"empower and give hope to facially disfigured children and their families\" [355] The annual Cher's Family Retreat is held each June to provide craniofacial patients, their siblings and parents an opportunity to interact with others who have endured similar

partnership with Icelandic Glacial [360]\n\n\nElder rights\nIn 2017, Cher weighed in on the need to protect elder rights as she executive produced Edith+Eddie, a documentary about a nonagenarian interracial couple It received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) [361]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nFollowing the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, Cher launched the CherCares Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative (CCPRRI) alongside Dr Irwin Redlener, the head of Columbia University's Pandemic Resource and Response Center The charity's initial plan is to distribute $1 million to \"chronically neglected and forgotten people\" during the pandemic through the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) Cher told Billboard, \"There are rural areas where people of color and Latinos and Native Americans were getting no services It's not a lot of money — $1 million goes in the blink of an eyelash! — so now I'm trying to get my friends to make it a lot more so we can do something that will really meet people's needs A friend once told me, 'When people walk in your path, then you know what you have to do.'\" [267]\n\n\nAnimal rights\nIn November 2020, Cher joined Four Paws International and traveled to Pakistan to advocate for and work with the country's government to have Kaavan, an elephant who had been confined to a zoo for 35 years, transferred to a wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia [362] In April 2021, Paramount+ released the documentary film Cher and the Loneliest Elephant, detailing Cher's quest, alongside animal aid groups and veterinarians, to free Kaavan from confinement [363]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nCher's older child, Chaz Bono, first came out as a lesbian at age 17, which reportedly caused Cher to feel \"guilt, fear and pain\" [348] However, she soon came to accept Chaz's sexual orientation, and came to the conclusion that LGBT people \"didn't have the same rights as everyone else,  [and she] thought that was unfair\" [364] She was the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention, and has since become one of the LGBT community's most vocal advocates [364] In May 1998, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for having \"made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbians and gay men\" [365] On June 11, 2009, Chaz came out as a transgender man, and his transition from female to male was legally finalized on May 6, 2010 [366]\n\n\nPolitics\nCher has said that she is not a registered Democrat, but has attended many Democratic conventions and events [367] Over the years, Cher's political views have attracted media attention, and she has been an outspoken critic of the conservative movement In an interview with Vanity Fair, she was critical of a variety of political topics, including Republican politicians like Sarah Palin and Jan Brewer [368] She has commented that she did not understand why anyone would be a Republican because eight years under the administration of George W Bush \"almost killed  [her]\" [369]\n\n\nLegacy\nCher is commonly referred to by the media as the \"Goddess of Pop\" [390] Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield stated how \"there are no other careers remotely like hers,  [particularly] in the history of pop music\" and referred to Cher as \"the one-woman embodiment of the whole gaudy story of pop music.\" [391] According to Goldmine magazine's Phill Marder, Cher \"has been and remains today one of the Rock Era's most dominant figures\" [392] He described her as the leader of an effort in the 1960s to \"advance feminine rebellion in the rock world  [and] the prototype of the female rock star, setting the standard for appearance, from her early hippie days to her later outlandish outfits, and her attitude—the perfect female punk long before punk even was a rock term.\" [392] Billboard's Joe Lynch described Cher as \"a woman who pioneered an androgynous musical identity in the mid '60s\", and who by doing so \"teed things up for people like Bowie and Patti Smith\" [393]\n\n\nAchievements\nAs a solo artist, Cher has sold 100 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time [41] [368] [410] She is one of the few artists to win three of the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT—Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony), [411] and one of five

The show was a ratings success, and the couple returned with a full-time show in December.\n\n## 1974-1979: Divorce and Second Marriage\n\nCher and Sonny had marital problems since late 1972, but appearances were maintained until 1974.

The couple battled in court over finances and the custody of their son, Chaz, which was eventually granted to Cher.\n\n## 1979-1982: Second Musical Comeback and Expansion\n\nCher realized that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career.

[because] she has managed to be at once boldly shocking and ultimately enigmatic.\" [305] New York Post movie critic David Edelstein attributes Cher's \"top-ranking star quality\" to her ability of projecting \"honesty, rawness and emotionality She wears her vulnerability on her sleeve.\" [305] Jeff Yarbrough of The Advocate wrote that Cher was \"one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping\", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film Silkwood [306]\n\n\nPublic image\nTime magazine's Cady Lang described Cher as a \"cultural phenomenon  [who] has forever changed the way we see celebrity fashion.\" [319] Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing \"hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas, and Cherokee-inspired tunics\" [320] She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy that year [320] Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in a beaded and feathered nude gown designed by Bob Mackie for the cover of Time magazine in 1975; [321] Billboard magazine's Brooke Mazurek described it as \"one of the most recreated and monumental looks of all time.\" [322] Cher first wore the gown to the 1974 Met Gala According to Vogue magazine's André Leon Talley, \"it was really the first time a Hollywood celebrity attended, and it changed everything We are still seeing versions of that look on The Met red carpet 40 years later.\" [322] Billboard wrote that Cher has \"transformed fashion and  [become] one of the most influential style icons in red carpet history\" [322]\n\n\nFashion\nTime magazine's Cady Lang described Cher as a \"cultural phenomenon  [who] has forever changed the way we see celebrity fashion.\" [319] Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing \"hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas, and Cherokee-inspired tunics\" [320] She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy that year [320] Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in a beaded and feathered nude gown designed by Bob Mackie for the cover of Time magazine in 1975; [321] Billboard magazine's Brooke Mazurek described it as \"one of the most recreated and monumental looks of all time.\" [322] Cher first wore the gown to the 1974 Met Gala According to Vogue magazine's André Leon Talley, \"it was really the first time a Hollywood celebrity attended, and it changed everything We are still seeing versions of that look on The Met red carpet 40 years later.\" [322] Billboard wrote that Cher has \"transformed fashion and  [become] one of the most influential style icons in red carpet history\" [322]\n\n\nPhysical appearance\nCher has attracted media attention for her physical appearance—particularly her youthful looks and her tattoos Paddy Calistro of the Los Angeles Times observed that during Cher's rise as a movie star in the 1980s, her \"highly articulated bone structure captured audience attention\", which led to an increased number of medical requests for \"surgically inserted 'cheekbones'\" [332] Journalists have often called Cher the \"poster girl\" of plastic surgery [333] Author Grant McCracken, in his book Transformations: Identity Construction in Contemporary Culture (2008), draws a parallel between Cher's plastic surgeries and the transformations in her career: \"Her plastic surgery is not merely cosmetic It is hyperbolic, extreme, over the top .. Cher has engaged in a transformational technology that is dramatic and irreversible.\" [333] Caroline Ramazanoglu, author of Up Against Foucault: Explorations of Some Tensions Between Foucault and Feminism (1993), wrote that \"Cher's operations have gradually replaced a strong, decidedly 'ethnic' look with a more symmetrical, delicate, 'conventional' .. and ever-youthful version of female beauty .. Her normalised image .. now acts as a standard against which other women will measure, judge, discipline and 'correct' themselves.\" [334] In 1992, Madame Tussauds wax museum honored Cher as one of the five \"most beautiful women of history\" by creating a life-size statue [335] She was ranked 26th on VH1's list of the \"100 Sexiest Artists\" published in 2002 [336]\n\n\nSocial media\nCher's social media presence has drawn analysis from journalists [342] Time named her \"Twitter's most outspoken (and beloved) commentator\" [319] The New York Times writer Jenna Wortham commended Cher on her social media usage, stating, \"Most celebrities' social-media feeds feel painfully self-aware and thirsty .. In her own way, Cher is an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit and yell (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and be rewarded for it Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye.\" [343] Monica Heisey of The Guardian described Cher's Twitter account as \"a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet\", and remarked, \"While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out.\" [344]\n\n\nAs a gay icon\nThe reverence held for Cher by members of the LGBT community has been attributed to her career accomplishments, her sense of style, and her longevity [345] Cher is considered a gay icon, and has often been imitated by drag queens [346] According to Salon magazine's Thomas Rogers, \" [d]rag queens imitate women like Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Cher because they overcame insult and hardship on their path to success, and because their narratives mirror the pain that many gay men suffer on their way out of the closet\" [346] According to Maclean's magazine's Elio Iannacci, Cher was \"one of the first to bring drag to the masses\" as she hired two drag queens to perform with her at her Las Vegas residency in 1979 [347] Cher's role as a lesbian in the film Silkwood, as well as her transition to dance music and social activism, have further contributed to her becoming a gay icon [348] The NBC sitcom Will & Grace acknowledged Cher's status by
