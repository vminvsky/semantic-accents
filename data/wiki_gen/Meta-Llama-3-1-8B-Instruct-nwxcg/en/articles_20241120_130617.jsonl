In 1936, while a sophomore at Denison (Iowa) High School, Reed's chemistry teacher gave her the book \"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\" which greatly influenced her life.

Reed had a cameo in \"Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder\" (1952). After a brief hiatus, Reed returned to television with the starring role of Donna Stone in \"The Donna Reed Show,\" which aired from 1958 to 1966.

The show featured Reed as Donna Stone, the wife of pediatrician Alex Stone (Carl Betz) and mother of Jeff (Paul Petersen) and Mary Stone (Shelley Fabares). Reed was attracted to the idea of being in a comedy, which was a departure from her usual dramatic roles.

After their divorce, she married producer Tony Owen in 1945. Together, they adopted two children, Penny Jane (born 1945) and Anthony (born 1946), and had two biological children, Timothy (born 1949) and Mary Anne (born 1957). The couple remained married for 26 years before divorcing in 1971.\n\n**Political Views**\n\nReed became interested in politics during the Vietnam War, when her adopted son Tony might have been drafted. In 1967, Reed became a peace activist and co-chaired the anti-war advocacy group, Another Mother for Peace.

In a 1971 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Reed stated her opposition to the war and her support for peace activism.\n\n**Death**\n\nDonna Reed died on January 14, 1986, at the age of 64, due to pancreatic cancer. She had been diagnosed with the illness three months earlier and was told it was at a terminal stage.

[16] but Prince Edward later said that his father had not put undue pressure on him to change his mind [12] Others stated that Philip was the most sympathetic family member toward his son's decision [17] Buckingham Palace said that Edward's decision came after \"much consideration\" and that he was leaving with great regret \"but has concluded that he does not wish to make the service his long-term career\" [18]\n\n\nRoyal Marines\nAfter graduating in 1986, Edward joined the Royal Marines, who had reportedly sponsored his tuition at Cambridge on condition of future service [14] He had signed up to join the Royal Marines in September 1983 [15] In January 1987, he dropped out of the commando course having completed one-third of the 12-month training Media reported that Prince Philip, who was the Captain General Royal Marines, was displeased, [16] but Prince Edward later said that his father had not put undue pressure on him to change his mind [12] Others stated that Philip was the most sympathetic family member toward his son's decision [17] Buckingham Palace said that Edward's decision came after \"much consideration\" and that he was leaving with great regret \"but has concluded that he does not wish to make the service his long-term career\" [18]\n\n\nTheatre and television\nAfter leaving military service, Edward opted to pursue a career in entertainment He commissioned the 1986 musical Cricket from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, for his mother's 60th birthday celebration, which led to a job offer at Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theatre Company, where he worked as a production assistant on musicals such as The Phantom of the Opera, Starlight Express, and Cats [19] While there he met actress Ruthie Henshall, whom he dated for three years.\n\n\nArdent Productions\nIn 1993, Edward founded the television production company Ardent Productions [22] Ardent was involved in the production of a number of documentaries and dramas, [23] but Edward was accused in the media of using his royal connections for financial gain, [24] and the company was referred to by some industry insiders as \"a sad joke\" due to a perceived lack of professionalism in its operations Andy Beckett, writing in The Guardian, opined that \"to watch Ardent's few dozen hours of broadcast output is to enter a strange kingdom where every man in Britain still wears a tie, where pieces to camera are done in cricket jumpers, where people clasp their hands behind their backs like guardsmen Commercial breaks are filled with army recruiting advertisements\" [22]\n\n\nMarriage and children\nEdward met Sophie Rhys-Jones for the first time in 1987 when he was dating her friend [30] They met again at a promotion shoot for the Prince Edward Summer Challenge to raise money for charity in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards [6] [31] In December 1993 and amid growing speculation about whether they were planning to marry, Edward wrote a letter to newspaper editors, in which he denied any wedding plans and asked the media to respect their privacy [32] Edward proposed to Sophie on holiday in the Bahamas in December 1998 and their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999 [6] [33] Edward proposed to Sophie with an Asprey and Garrard engagement ring worth an estimated £105,000: a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat white gold [34]\n\n\nActivities\nThe Earl and Countess of Wessex established their foundation, the Wessex Youth Trust, in 1999, with a focus on helping, supporting and advancing registered charities which provide opportunities specifically for children and young people [42] His patronages include: the British Paralympic Association, [43] the International Real Tennis Professionals Association, [44] the Commonwealth Games Federation, [45] [46] BadmintonScotland, [47] the Tennis and Rackets Association, [48] City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, [49] [50] London Mozart Players, [51] Haddo House Choral and Operatic Society, [52] Northern Ballet, [53] [54] the Edinburgh International Festival, [55] the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, [56] the Production Guild, [57] and the National Youth Theatre [58]\n\n\nIn the media\nIn 1999, Edward was criticised by Labour MPs John Cryer and Lindsay Hoyle for comments he made during an interview with The New York Times, in which he stated that in Britain \"They hate anyone who succeeds\" and \"America is where the money is\" [102] [103] The criticism prompted him to issue a statement, clarifying \"that offending the British public was the very last thing I would have wanted to do\" [103]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nUntil his marriage, Edward was known as \"His Royal Highness The Prince Edward\" On 19 June 1999, he became \"His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex\" Buckingham Palace announced the intention that Edward would eventually be created Duke of Edinburgh, a title then held by his father, Prince Philip, once it had merged in the Crown upon the death of both his parents [105] On 10 March 2019, his 55th birthday, Edward was granted the additional title of Earl of Forfar for use in Scotland [106] [107] [108] On his 59th birthday, 10 March 2023, Edward was created Duke of Edinburgh, thus becoming \"His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh\" [109] [110] His ducal title is not hereditary, so it will revert to the crown on his death [111]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nUntil his marriage, Edward was known as \"His Royal Highness The

{"title": "Astroworld_Festival_crowd_crush", "content": "\nBackground\nAmerican rapper Travis Scott founded the annual Astroworld Festival music event in 2018, taking its name from his third studio album that was released the same year [3]  Astroworld 2021 was organized and managed by Live Nation and its affiliates Apple Music would live-stream Scott's performance [4]\n\n\nLogistics\nThe 2021 festival was to be held over two consecutive nights Tickets sold out in under an hour after going on sale in May Over 100,000 people were expected to attend Authorities planned to limit first-night attendees to 70,000 Later, attendee numbers were further reduced to 50,000, although city fire codes permitted up to 200,000 people [5] [6] [7] The city of Houston and Harris County organized security for the event Mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner stated more than 1,000 security staff and police were present; [8] the exact number of police was estimated at 530, more than double the number at 2019's Astroworld event, with only about 240 police officers [9]\n\n\nWarning signs\nWeeks before the festival, NRG's park's General Manager Mark Miller noted repeated concerns about the \"ratio of guests to staff\" [12] Live Nation subsidiary ScoreMore Shows offered to remedy this by providing more staff Exclusivity agreements for NRG Park prevented the county from using services other than  those offered by Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC) As a result, on November 4, Harris County officials signed an amendment to the contract with ScoreMore providing more staff [12] Showrunners Live Nation and ScoreMore contracted Seyth Boardman, co-founder of live-entertainment risk-management company B3 Risk Solutions, for Astroworld as its safety-and-risk director; Boardman was also a longtime manager at CSC, resulting in conflicts of interest on budgetary issues, staffing, and security protocol [14]\n\n\nTimeline\nAt 5:00 a.m., fans began to line up at the festival's outer perimeter [22] At 7:00 a.m., HFD and HPD set up their command post in the Orange Lot, more than 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the festival main stage In the planning documents, a second incident command post in the Purple Lot was outlined HFD chief Sam Peña stated he was not aware of the second command post and no firefighters were posted there [12]\n\n\nBuild-up\nAt 5:00 a.m., fans began to line up at the festival's outer perimeter [22] At 7:00 a.m., HFD and HPD set up their command post in the Orange Lot, more than 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the festival main stage In the planning documents, a second incident command post in the Purple Lot was outlined HFD chief Sam Peña stated he was not aware of the second command post and no firefighters were posted there [12]\n\n\nOnstage events\nScott was scheduled to start his set at 8:45 p.m but did not appear on stage until 9:02 p.m., starting his set at 9:06 p.m [22] [25] [36] [35] His appearance resulted in a push toward it, leading to a human crush [28] [7] According to HFD Chief Sam Peña, at about 9:00 p.m., members of the crowd pressed forward and surged from the sides, causing a crush near the stage; he added the crush was caused by issues close to the stage, where the crowd was tightly packed, rather than by obstructed exits As people struggled to remain standing, several began to fall and many were injured Panic grew as Scott started the second song of his set and the remaining escape routes shrank, and several attendees attempted to climb over barricades [12] [30] [35] [39]\n\n\nCrush\nSeveral veteran ParaDocs supervisors, including one who was trapped in the southern quadrant attempting to assist three concertgoers in critical condition while being protected by some attendees, told Business Insider the majority of the patients they were attempting to resuscitate had no signs of physical trauma, such as stepped-on faces or chests, but had fixed and dilated pupils—signs of anoxia—as a result of suffocation while on their feet Even for trapped concertgoers who remained upright, a local internal medicine physician told Houston Chronicle those who could not expand their diaphragms, leading to blood flow to be restricted to the brain and heart, likely died within minutes as a result of cardiac arrest [45] [34] [12]\n\n\nImmediate response\nAt the concert's opening, ParaDocs' chief dispatcher Jon Saltzman told Business Insider Unified Command, where he was stationed, received reports of at least three attendees suffering smoke inhalation from the stage's fireworks; then, his radio check-ins to supervisors stationed at forward triage positions were responded to with what he deciphered to be at least three reports of cardiac arrest, the highest number he and his colleagues had seen at any event they had worked Saltzman told the festival dispatcher at command to shut down the festival then waited for a response he implied he never received [45]\n\n\nVictims\nTen people died as a result of the Astroworld Festival crowd crush Eight victims, aged 9 to 27, died on the night of the concert [60] One formerly unidentified victim was later identified to be 23-year-old Axel Acosta [61] Twenty-two-year-old student Bharti Shahani was declared brain dead on November 9 [62] and died the next day [24] Nine-year-old boy Ezra Blount, who was placed in a medically induced coma after being crushed and trampled at the concert, died on November 14 [63] It was the highest number of accidental deaths at a U.S concert since the Station nightclub fire, which killed 100 people in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 [64]\n\n\nAftermath\nImmediately following the concert, Travis Scott attended a scheduled, private after-party at a local Dave & Buster's restaurant Scott and fellow performer Drake did not hear pleas to stop the concert while it was in progress; they first learned about the severity of the incident at the restaurant and immediately left [66] [67] [68]\n\n\nReactions\nIn a statement posted on his social media the next day, Scott offered his condolences to those who died, and offered support to local authorities [78] [failed verification] Later that day, he posted a video response on Instagram Stories that some media criticized for its perceived insincerity and parodied it on social media [71] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [excessive citations] Also that day, Scott's then-girlfriend Kylie Jenner who attended the show and her sister Kendall deleted their social-media posts related to the festival following criticism Both released subsequent statements expressing their sympathy; Kylie said she and Scott were unaware of the fatalities until after the concert, they would not have continued filming or performing if they had been aware [84] [85] [86] [87] [excessive citations] The following day, Apple Music, which live-streamed the event, deleted its social-media posts related to the festival and issued a statement commemorating the victims [88] On November 8, Drake released his first statement, voicing similar sentiments to Scott's [89] [90]\n\n\nFestival performers and companies\nIn a statement posted on his social media the next day, Scott offered his condolences to those who died, and offered support to local authorities [78] [failed verification] Later that day, he posted a video response on Instagram Stories that some media criticized for its perceived insincerity and parodied it on social media [71] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [excessive citations] Also that day, Scott's then-girlfriend Kylie Jenner who attended the

which live-streamed the event, deleted its social-media posts related to the festival and issued a statement commemorating the victims [88] On November 8, Drake released his first statement, voicing similar sentiments to Scott's [89] [90]\n\n\nDonations and reimbursements\nThat weekend, American musicians Roddy Ricch and Toro y Moi both announced they would donate their net payments for performing at the event to the victims' families [95] [96]\n\n\nTravis Scott sponsors and partnerships\nAccording to Variety on November 8, Scott had canceled his headlining appearance at the Day N Vegas Festival on November 13 in Las Vegas, Nevada [107] Houston Rockets scheduled a Travis Scott Day celebration for its November 10 home game against Detroit Pistons was postponed out of sensitivity for the victims; it instead observed a moment of silence [108]  A streetwear boutique owned by Scott's and DJ Chase B at Rice Village, Houston, indefinitely closed following the crush incident [66]\n\n\nPolitical and cultural responses\nOn the night of the incident, Senator Ted Cruz described the events as horrific and said there needed to be a very serious, credible, and objective investigation [127] The next day, Texas governor Greg Abbott said: \"What happened at Astroworld Festival last night was tragic, and our hearts are with those who lost their lives and those who were injured in the terrifying crowd surge\" [7] On November 10, Abbott announced the formation of the Texas Task Force on Concert Safety Panel to begin creating safety standards and guidelines for future events of this type in the state [128] [15] [129] Rapper Megan Thee Stallion announced she had cancelled her local show scheduled for December 3 out of respect for the victims [130]\n\n\nInvestigation\nImmediately after the incident, local homicide and narcotics investigators, [142] representatives for the insurance companies of the defendants, OSHA, and lawyers for the concertgoers attended the venue [143] On November 8, a judge issued a limited freeze order to pause cleanup of the site, allowing victims' lawyers to investigate and take photographs, and requiring organizers to preserve remaining evidence after an agreement was reached with defendants, clarifying it did not entirely waive their legal defenses [144] Live Nation and ScoreMore said they were working with local authorities, investigators were inspecting the grounds, and CCTV video had been handed over [15] [31] Also on November 8, Director of the FBI Christopher A Wray told ABC News his agency would be providing technical assistance to local investigators, and FBI Houston branch spokesperson Brittany Davis said they were ready to assist, but city officials initially declined to publicly divulge whether the department had asked for the FBI's aid or had accepted it On November 10, Chief Finner called the FBI a partner in the investigation but said his department was taking the lead [8] [145] [142]\n\n\nJurisdiction discussions\nLawyers for the victims and local officials, including Harris County judge Lina Hidalgo, proposed an independent investigation to avoid conflicts of interest, and Finner said on November 10 he would be open to it if the HPD's investigation revealed there was a need Subsequent reporting said the county's ability to take action had been complicated by Finner's announcement of his own investigation, and by Scott's ties to local officials and investment in the city Several media outlets asked Scott whether it factored into Scott being granted less scrutiny and more leeway regarding usual concert rules that night [11] [31] [33] [157] Amid a conflict over jurisdiction between the city and the county on instituting additional permitting at NRG Park post-incident, Houston's mayor Sylvester Turner said he would not wait for the county commissioners to institute changes before taking action on his own [39]\n\n\nCulpability discussions\nIn response to inquiries about the 40-minute delay after a mass casualty declaration, Finner later cited his deference to festival authorities on the decision and concerns about possible rioting, saying: \"you cannot just close when you have over 50,000 individuals\" [160] Finner also deferred to Live Nation on culpability Media and live-entertainment experts disputed both explanations, citing clauses in Houston's charter for what qualified as an emergency and actions that could have been taken such as a longer show pause, partial evacuation, or emergency messaging on the speakers or video boards, none of which were used [11] [12] [158] [160]\n\n\nResponsibility for stopping the show\nIn response to inquiries about the 40-minute delay after a mass casualty declaration, Finner later cited his deference to festival authorities on the decision and concerns about possible rioting, saying: \"you cannot just close when you have over 50,000 individuals\" [160] Finner also deferred to Live Nation

Crush**\n\nThe Astroworld Festival crowd crush was a series of events that occurred on November 5, 2021, at the Astroworld Festival in Houston, Texas. The festival was held at NRG Park, a large entertainment complex that hosts various events throughout the year. The incident resulted in the deaths of ten people and injured many others, making it one of the deadliest music festival incidents in recent history.\n\n**Background**\n\nAmerican rapper Travis Scott founded the annual Astroworld Festival music event in 2018, taking its name from his third studio album that was released the same year. Astroworld 2021 was organized and managed by Live Nation and its affiliates, with Apple Music live-streaming Scott's performance. The festival was held over two consecutive nights, with tickets selling out in under an hour after going on sale in May. Over 100,000 people were expected to attend, with authorities planning to limit first-night attendees to 70,000. Later, attendee numbers were further reduced to 50,000, although city fire codes permitted up to 200,000 people.\n\n**Logistics**\n\nThe 2021 festival was to be held over two consecutive nights, with tickets selling out in under an hour after going on sale in May. Over 100,000 people were expected to attend, with authorities planning to limit first-night attendees to 70,000. Later, attendee numbers were further reduced to 50,000, although city fire codes permitted up to 200,000 people. The city of Houston and Harris County organized security for the event, with Mayor Sylvester Turner stating that more than 1,000 security staff and police were present. The exact number of police was estimated at 530, more than double the number at 2019's Astroworld event, with only about 240 police officers.\n\n**Warning Signs**\n\nWeeks before the festival, NRG's park's General Manager Mark Miller noted repeated concerns about the \"ratio of guests to staff.\" Live Nation subsidiary ScoreMore Shows offered to remedy this by providing more staff, but exclusivity agreements for NRG Park prevented the county from using services other than those offered by Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC). As a result, on November 4, Harris County officials signed an amendment to the contract with ScoreMore providing more staff. Showrunners Live Nation and ScoreMore contracted Seyth Boardman, co-founder of live-entertainment risk-management company B3 Risk Solutions, for Astroworld as its safety-and-risk director. Boardman was also a longtime manager at CSC, resulting in conflicts of interest on budgetary issues, staffing, and security protocol.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nAt 5:00 a.m., fans began to line up at the festival's outer perimeter. At 7:00 a.m., HFD and HPD set up their command post in the Orange Lot, more than 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the festival main stage. In the planning documents, a second incident command post in the Purple Lot was outlined. HFD chief Sam Peña stated he was not aware of the second command post and no firefighters were posted there.\n\n**Onstage Events**\n\nScott was scheduled to start his set at 8:45 p.m. but did not appear on stage until 9:02 p.m., starting his set at 9:06 p.m. His appearance resulted in a push toward it, leading to a human crush. According to HFD Chief Sam Peña, at about 9:00 p.m., members of the crowd pressed forward and surged from the sides, causing a crush near the stage. He added the crush was caused by issues close to the stage, where the crowd was tightly packed, rather than by obstructed exits. As people struggled to remain standing, several began to fall and many were injured. Panic grew as Scott started the second song of his set, and the remaining escape routes shrank, and several attendees attempted to climb over barricades.\n\n**Crush**\n\nSeveral veteran ParaDocs supervisors told Business Insider that the majority of the patients they were attempting to resuscitate had no signs of physical trauma, such as stepped-on faces or chests, but had fixed and dilated pupils—signs of anoxia—as a result of suffocation while on their feet. Even for trapped concertgoers who remained upright, a local internal medicine physician told Houston Chronicle that those who could not expand their diaphragms, leading to blood flow to be restricted to the brain and heart, likely died within minutes as a result of cardiac arrest.\n\n**Immediate Response**\n\nAt the concert's opening, ParaDocs' chief dispatcher Jon Saltzman told Business Insider that Unified Command received reports of at least three attendees suffering smoke inhalation from the stage's fireworks. Then, his radio check-ins to supervisors stationed at forward triage positions were responded to with what he deciphered to be at least three reports of cardiac arrest, the highest number he and his

formerly unidentified victim was later identified to be 23-year-old Axel Acosta [61] Twenty-two-year-old student Bharti Shahani was declared brain dead on November 9 [62] and died the next day [24] Nine-year-old boy Ezra Blount, who was placed in a medically induced coma after being crushed and trampled at the concert, died on November 14 [63] It was the highest number of accidental deaths at a U.S concert since the Station nightclub fire, which killed 100 people in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 [64]\n\n\nAftermath\nImmediately following the concert, Travis Scott attended a scheduled,

Roddy Ricch and Toro y Moi both announced they would donate their net payments for performing at the event to the victims' families [95] [96]\n\n\nTravis Scott sponsors and partnerships\nAccording to Variety on November 8, Scott had canceled his headlining appearance at the Day N Vegas Festival on November 13 in Las Vegas, Nevada [107] Houston Rockets scheduled a Travis Scott Day celebration for its November 10 home game against Detroit Pistons was postponed out of sensitivity for the victims; it instead observed a moment of silence [108]  A streetwear boutique owned by Scott's and DJ Chase B at Rice Village, Houston, indefinitely closed following the crush incident [66]\n\n\nPolitical and cultural responses\nOn the night of the incident, Senator Ted Cruz described the events as horrific and said there needed to be a very serious, credible, and objective investigation [127] The next day, Texas governor Greg Abbott said: \"What happened at Astroworld Festival last night was tragic, and our hearts are with those who lost their lives and those who were injured in the terrifying crowd surge\" [7] On November 10, Abbott announced the formation of the Texas Task Force on Concert Safety Panel to begin creating safety standards and guidelines for future events of this type in the state [128] [15] [129] Rapper Megan Thee Stallion announced she had cancelled her local show scheduled for December 3 out of respect for the victims [130]\n\n\nInvestigation\nImmediately after the incident, local homicide and narcotics investigators, [142] representatives for the insurance companies of the defendants, OSHA, and lawyers for the concertgoers attended the venue [143] On November 8, a judge issued a limited freeze order to pause cleanup of the site, allowing victims' lawyers to investigate and take photographs, and requiring organizers to preserve remaining evidence after an agreement was reached with defendants, clarifying it did not entirely waive their legal defenses [144] Live Nation and ScoreMore said they were working with local authorities, investigators were inspecting the grounds, and CCTV video had been handed over [15] [31] Also on November 8, Director of the FBI Christopher A Wray told ABC News his agency would be providing technical assistance to local investigators, and FBI Houston branch spokesperson Brittany Davis said they were ready to assist, but city officials initially declined to publicly divulge whether the department had asked for the FBI's aid or had accepted it On November 10, Chief Finner called the FBI a partner in the investigation but said his department was taking the lead [8] [145] [142]\n\n\nJurisdiction discussions\nLawyers for the victims and local officials, including Harris County judge Lina Hidalgo, proposed an independent investigation to avoid conflicts of interest, and Finner said on November 10 he would be open to it if the HPD's investigation revealed there was a need Subsequent reporting said the county's ability to take action had been complicated by Finner's announcement of his own investigation, and by Scott's ties to local officials and investment in the city Several media outlets asked Scott whether it factored into Scott being granted less scrutiny and more leeway regarding usual concert rules that night [11] [31] [33] [157] Amid a conflict over jurisdiction between the city and the county on instituting additional permitting at NRG Park post-incident, Houston's mayor Sylvester Turner said he would not wait for the county commissioners to institute changes before taking action on his own [39]\n\n\nCulpability discussions\nIn response to inquiries about the 40-minute delay after a mass casualty declaration, Finner later cited his deference to festival authorities on the decision and concerns about possible rioting, saying: \"you cannot just close when you have over 50,000 individuals\" [160] Finner also deferred to Live Nation on culpability Media and live-entertainment experts disputed both explanations, citing clauses in Houston's charter for what qualified as an emergency and actions that could have been taken such as a longer show pause, partial evacuation, or emergency messaging on the speakers or video boards, none of which were used [11] [12] [158] [160]\n\n\nResponsibility for stopping the show\nIn response to inquiries about the 40-minute delay after a mass

challenging for Colombia to host, although FIFA President João Havelange initially gave assurances that they could revert to a 16-team tournament [7] Colombian president Julio César Turbay Ayala was initially against holding the tournament in his country, but reluctantly granted permission in October 1980 [8] However, the next Colombian president, Belisario Betancur, declared on 5 November 1982

FIFA World Cup was the 13th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It was held in Mexico from May 31 to June 29, 1986. The tournament was won by Argentina, who defeated West Germany 3-2 in the final.\n\n**Host selection**\n\nColombia was originally chosen as hosts by FIFA in June 1974, with Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Pereira, and Bucaramanga intended as the host cities, plus potentially Barranquilla. Colombia agreed to host a 16-team competition. However, FIFA later allowed an expansion to 24 teams for the 1982 World Cup in Spain, which was more challenging for Colombia to host, although FIFA President João Havelange initially gave assurances that they could revert to a 16-team tournament. Colombian president Julio César Turbay Ayala was initially against holding the tournament in his country, but reluctantly granted permission in October 1980. However, the next Colombian president, Belisario Betancur, declared on 5 November 1982 that they could not afford to host the World Cup under the terms that FIFA demanded.\n\n**Mascot**\n\nThe official mascot of the 1986 World Cup was Pique, a jalapeño pepper, characteristic of Mexican cuisine, with a moustache, a Colimote sombrero, and Mexican football team colours. Its name comes from picante, a Spanish word meaning \"spicy\", and was also a pun on the \"PK\" abbreviation of the football term penalty kick. Pique is also a common Spanish name.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThree teams qualified for the World Cup for the first time: Canada, Denmark, and Iraq. Canada clinched its spot after winning the final match against Honduras 2-1 in St John's, Newfoundland. Iraq played all their home matches on neutral ground because of the Iran-Iraq War. South Korea qualified for the first time since 1954, Paraguay for the first time since 1958, Portugal for the first time since 1966, and Bulgaria and Uruguay for the first time since 1974. As of 2022, this was the last time that Hungary and Northern Ireland qualified for the finals, and the only time that Iraq have qualified. The Netherlands once again failed to qualify, even though they would go on to win the European Championship only two years later.\n\n**List of qualified teams**\n\nThe following 24 teams qualified for the final tournament:\n\n1.

The Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, the largest stadium used for the tournament, hosted nine matches (including the final), more than any other stadium used. Mexico City hosted 13 total matches; the Olimpico Universitario Stadium hosted four matches (if the Mexico City suburban town Nezahualcoyotl's three matches are included, this brings the total up to 16 matches; nearly a third of all matches in this tournament). Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city hosted 10 total matches (the Jalisco Stadium hosted seven matches, the Tres de Marzo Stadium in Zapopan hosted three), Monterrey hosted seven matches (The Tecnologico Stadium hosted three matches and the Universitario Stadium in San Nicolas de los Garza hosted four matches), and the Cuauhtémoc Stadium in Puebla hosted five matches.\n\n**Match officials**\n\nThe match officials for the 1986 FIFA World Cup were:\n\n*  Armando Perez Hoyos (Colombia)\n*  Andre Daina (Switzerland)\n*  George Courtney (England)\n*  Volker Roth (West Germany)\n*  David Syme (Scotland)\n*  Siegfried Kirschen (East Germany)\n*  Paolo Casarin (Italy)\n*  Carlos Silva Valente (Portugal)\n*  Gérard Biguet (France)\n*  Erik Fredriksson (Sweden)\n*  Bob Valentine (Scotland)\n\n**Squads**\n\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see 1986 FIFA World Cup squads.\n\n**Seeding**\n\nThe first round of the finals began in Group A, where Italy were held 1-1 by Bulgaria.

Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco [2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\nBribery and corruption allegations\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote [4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine Titanic sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote [5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid, [6] would have had to cast the deciding vote [7]\n\n\nQualification\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup [18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean) The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\nList of qualified teams\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, [19] qualified for the finals tournament:\n\n\nVenues\nIn 2006, Germany had a plethora of football stadia that satisfied FIFA's minimum capacity of 40,000 seats for World Cup matches The outdated and still-standing Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250), the venue for the 1974 final match was not used for the tournament, even though FIFA's regulations allow one city to use two stadia Düsseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's Weserstadion (43,000) and Mönchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also not used.\n\n\nTeam base camps\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team [33]\n\n\nMatch officials\nSquads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23 players, as in the previous tournament in 2002 Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by 15 May 2006 [35]\n\n\nSquads\nSquads for

seeded teams for the tournament were announced on 6 December 2005 and placed into Pot A for the draw Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America, Africa and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia To ensure that no group contained three European teams, Serbia and Montenegro was placed in a special pot, as they were the lowest ranked qualified team from Europe on the latest FIFA World Ranking; while it was deemed of less importance they had been seeded higher than Switzerland and Ukraine by the 2006 World Cup seeding tool [36] Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n\nSeeds\nThe eight seeded teams for the tournament were announced on 6 December 2005 and placed into Pot A for the draw Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America, Africa and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia To ensure that no group contained three European teams, Serbia and Montenegro was placed in a special pot, as they were the lowest ranked qualified team from Europe on the latest FIFA World Ranking; while it was deemed of less importance they had been seeded higher than Switzerland and Ukraine by the 2006 World Cup seeding tool [36] Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n\nGroup system\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the 32 teams divided into eight groups of four teams Each group was a round-robin of three games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.\n\n\nRanking criteria\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n\n\nFinals tournament\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June In total, 64 games were played.\n\n\nHosting\nAlthough Germany failed to win the Cup, the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flags waving, traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played [40] For the closing ceremonies, Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann, Zubin Mehta and Mariss Jansons, and soloists Diana Damrau, Plácido Domingo and Lang Lang.\n\n\nTraditional powers dominate\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador, and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and no quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders [41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966, and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\nScoring\nDespite the early goals that flooded the group stages, the knock-out phase had a much lower goals per match ratio A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal, which only scored in the 23rd minute of the round of 16, and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place play-off No player managed to score a hat-trick in this tournament Italy, Germany, Argentina, Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match Germany was one of the exceptions, tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knock-out stage, which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals (14), with players from all three outfield positions (defence, midfield and forward) making the scoresheet.\n\n\nUnprecedented number of cards\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia.\n\n\nGroup stage\nAll times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+2).\n\n\nGroup A\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3–0 Despite the defeat, Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2–0 and 3–0, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nGroup B\nIn Group B, England and Sweden pushed Paraguay into third place after narrow victories over the South Americans Trinidad and Tobago earned some international respect after a draw with Sweden in their opening game and managing to hold England scoreless for 83 minutes, until goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard sealed a 2–0 win for the Three Lions Sweden qualified for the knockout rounds after drawing 2–2 with England to maintain their 38-year unbeaten record against them.\n\n\n\n\nGroup C\nBoth Argentina and Netherlands qualified from Group C with a game remaining Argentina topped the group on goal difference, having hammered Serbia and Montenegro 6–0 and beaten Ivory Coast 2–1 The Dutch picked up 1–0 and 2–1 victories over Serbia and Montenegro and Ivory Coast, respectively Ivory Coast defeated Serbia and Montenegro 3–2 in their final game, in Serbia and Montenegro's last international as the country had dissolved 18 days earlier.\n\n\n\n\nGroup D\nPortugal coasted through in Group D, picking up the maximum number of points, with Mexico qualifying in second Iran missed chances against Mexico in their opening 1–3 defeat and were eliminated in their match against Portugal They fought hard against the Portuguese, but lost 2–0 Their last game against Angola ended in 1–1 draw The Africans had a respectable first World Cup tournament after earning draws with Mexico (0–0) and Iran.\n\n\n\n\nGroup E\nIn Group E, Italy went through to the Round of 16 conceding just one goal (an own goal) by Cristian Zaccardo in the group phase against the United States The US bowed out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic and Ghana, 0–3 and 1–2, respectively, despite a 1–1 draw (finishing with 9 vs 10 men) against Italy Tournament debutant Ghana joined Italy in the round of 16, following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States Daniele De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sending-off against the United States.\n\n\n\n\nGroup F\nGroup F included the reigning World Champions Brazil, Croatia, Japan, and Australia Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1, and, despite losing 0–2 to Brazil, a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win.\n\n\n\n\nGroup G\nFrance only managed a scoreless draw against Switzerland and a 1–1 draw against South Korea With captain Zinedine Zidane suspended, their 2–0 win against Togo was enough for them to advance to the knockout round They were joined by the group winners, Switzerland, who defeated South Korea 2–0, and did not concede a goal in the tournament South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo, but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 (the only team for which this was the case), while Togo exited without a point.\n\n\n\n\nGroup H\nSpain dominated Group H, picking up the maximum number of points, scoring 8 goals, and conceding only 1 Ukraine, despite being beaten 4–0 by Spain in their first World Cup game, took advantage of the weaker opponents to beat Saudi Arabia 4–0 and scrape past Tunisia 1–0 thanks to a 70th-minute penalty by Andriy Shevchenko, to reach the Round of 16 Saudi Arabia and Tunisia went out of the tournament having 1 point each, thanks to a 2–2 draw against each other.\n\n\n\n\nKnockout stage\nThe knockout stage involved the sixteen teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place For each game in the knockout stage, a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves); if scores were still level there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.\n\n\nBracket\nResults decided after extra time are indicated by (a.e.t.), and results decided via a penalty shoot-out are indicated by (p).\n\n\nRound of 16\nIn the second round, conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the Albiceleste in the quarter-finals Australia's journey ended when Italy were awarded a controversial penalty scored by Francesco Totti, deep into the remaining seconds of the match, after Fabio Grosso went down in the penalty box [43] The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field, following a controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi In a 0–0 match, described in The Guardian as \"the dullest game in World Cup history\", [44] Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shoot-out against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal) No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nQuarter-finals\nGermany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semifinals (this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shootout: up until this match, Argentina and Germany had each participated in three penalty shootouts, winning all of them).\n\n\nSemi-finals\nWith Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European semi-final line up was completed for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\nThird place play-off\nThe hosts got three goals in 20 minutes in the second half with the help of 21-year-old left midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head Only 4 minutes later, Schweinsteiger's free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box, driven low across goal, was connected with Petit's knee to become an own goal for Portugal The German did not stop, and netted his second goal, which swerved away to the keeper's left, in the 78th minute.\n\n\nFinal\nThe final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventh-minute penalty kick, [46] which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up, hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal [47] Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta The reverse angle review anyway clears that there was no penalty and the referee took the right decision.\n\n\nStatistics\nMiroslav Klose received the Golden Boot for scoring five goals in the World Cup In total, 147 goals were scored by 110 players, with four of

the Organising Committee sought a way to accommodate people planning to visit The experience of past World Cups and public viewing was conceptualized in 4-week-long events for football supporters to meet, board, interact, partake in cultural activities and watch all 64 matches on giant video walls Since 2004, the details on costs, logistics, safety issues, marketing and broadcasting rights were jointly hammered out by FIFA and the host cities [53] These public viewing events, known as \"Fan Fests\" (German: Fanmeile), served an idea to provide football supporters without tickets a legitimate opportunity to partake in the World Cup Unlike the past tournaments where ticket-less fans were treated as security risks, the World Cup in Germany welcomed all supporters, thus generating positive atmosphere even before the tournament began Even though security planners and media were sceptical and cautious on the matter of public viewing, the scepticism was cast aside with the beginning of the World Cup [54]\n\n\nLocations\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the rights for the broadcast of 2006 FIFA World Cup to the following broadcasters.\n\n\nMarketing\nFIFA, through several companies,

Cup was the 18th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament was held in Germany from June 9 to July 9, 2006.\n\n**Host selection**\n\nThe vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in Zürich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England, and Morocco. Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on June 6, 2000, and the final round was held on June 7, 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n**Bribery and corruption allegations**\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote. On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine Titanic sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote. Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favored the South African bid, would have had to cast the deciding vote.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nA total of 198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n**List of qualified teams**\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, qualified for the finals tournament:\n\n1. Argentina\n2. Australia\n3. Belgium\n4. Brazil\n5. Croatia\n6. Czech Republic\n7. England\n8. Equatorial Guinea\n9. France\n10. Germany\n11. Ghana\n12. Iran\n13. Italy\n14. Ivory Coast\n15.

Sweden\n29. Switzerland\n30. Togo\n31. Trinidad and Tobago\n32. Ukraine\n\n**Venues**\n\nIn 2006, Germany had a plethora of football stadia that satisfied FIFA's minimum capacity of 40,000 seats for World Cup matches. The outdated and still-standing Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250), the venue for the 1974 final match, was not used for the tournament, even though FIFA's regulations allow one city to use two stadia. Düsseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's Weserstadion (43,000), and Mönchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also not used.\n\n**Team base camps**\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\n\n**Match officials**\n\nSquads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23 players, as in the previous tournament in 2002. Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by May 15, 2006.\n\n**Squads**\n\nSquads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23 players, as in the previous tournament in 2002. Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by May 15, 2006.\n\n**Groups**\n\nThe eight seeded teams for the tournament were announced on December 6, 2005, and placed into Pot A for the draw. Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America, Africa, and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro. Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia. To ensure that no group contained three European teams, Serbia and Montenegro was placed in a special pot, as they were the lowest ranked qualified team from Europe on the latest FIFA World Ranking; while it was deemed of less importance they had been seeded higher than Switzerland and Ukraine by the 2006 World Cup seeding tool. Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n**Seeds**\n\nThe eight seeded teams for the tournament were announced on December 6, 2005, and placed into Pot A for the draw. Pot B contained the unseeded qualifiers from South America, Africa, and Oceania; Pot C contained eight of the nine remaining European teams, excluding Serbia and Montenegro. Pot D contained unseeded teams from the CONCACAF region and Asia.\n\n**Group system**\n\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the 32 teams divided into eight groups of four teams each. Each group was a round-robin of three games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw, and none for a defeat. The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.\n\n**Ranking criteria**\n\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n\n1. Goal difference\n2. Goals scored\n3. Head-to-head results\n4. FIFA World Rankings\n\n**Finals tournament**\n\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on June 9. The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on June 24.\n\n**Hosting**\n\nAlthough Germany failed to win the Cup, the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general. Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flags waving, traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played. For the closing ceremonies, Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian State Orchestra, and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann, Zubin Mehta, and Mariss Jansons, and soloists Diana Damrau, Plácido Domingo, and Lang Lang.\n\n**Traditional powers dominate**\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador, and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal), and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and no quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders. Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966, and 1982 tournaments).\n\n**Scoring**\n\nDespite the early goals that flooded the group stages, the knock-out phase had a much lower goals per match ratio. A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal, which only scored in the 23rd minute of the round of 16, and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place play-off. No player managed to score a hat-trick in this tournament. Italy, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match. Germany was one of the exceptions, tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knock-out stage, which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals (14), with players from all three outfield positions (defence, midfield, and forward) making the scoresheet.\n\n**Unprecedented number of cards**\n\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup. Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands. Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far.\n\n**Group stage**\n\nAll times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+2).\n\n**Group A**\n\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history. Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3–0. Despite the defeat, Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2–0 and 3–0, respectively.\n\n**Group B**\n\nIn Group B, England and Sweden pushed Paraguay into third place after narrow victories over the South Americans. Trinidad and Tobago earned some international respect after a draw with Sweden in their opening game and managing to hold England scoreless for 83 minutes, until goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard sealed a 2–0 win for the Three Lions. Sweden qualified for the knockout rounds after drawing 2–2 with England to maintain their 38-year unbeaten record against them.\n\n**Group C**\n\nBoth Argentina and Netherlands qualified from Group C with a game remaining. Argentina topped the group on goal difference, having hammered Serbia and Montenegro 6–0 and beaten Ivory Coast 2–1. The Dutch picked up 1–0 and 2–1 victories over Serbia and Montenegro and Ivory Coast, respectively. Ivory Coast defeated Serbia and Montenegro 3–2 in their final game, in Serbia and Montenegro's last international as the country had dissolved 18 days earlier.\n\n**Group D**\n\nPortugal coasted through in Group D, picking up the maximum number of points, with Mexico qualifying in second. Iran missed chances against Mexico in their opening 1–3 defeat and were eliminated in their match against Portugal. They fought hard against the Portuguese, but lost 2–0. Their last game against Angola ended in 1–1 draw. The Africans had a respectable first World Cup tournament after earning draws with Mexico (0–0) and Iran.\n\n**Group E**\n\nIn Group E, Italy went through to the Round of 16 conceding just one goal (an own goal) by Cristian Zaccardo in the group phase against the United States. The US bowed out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic and Ghana, 0–3 and 1–2, respectively, despite a 1–1 draw (finishing with 9 vs 10 men) against Italy. Tournament debutant Ghana joined Italy in the round of 16, following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States. Daniele De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sending-off against the United States.\n\n**Group F**\n\nGroup F included the reigning World Champions Brazil, Croatia, Japan, and Australia. Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1, and, despite losing 0–2 to Brazil, a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll. The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group. Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká. Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win.\n\n**Group G**\n\nFrance only managed a scoreless draw against Switzerland and a 1–1 draw against South Korea. With captain Zinedine Zidane suspended, their 2–0 win against Togo was enough for them to advance to the knockout round. They were joined by the group winners, Switzerland, who defeated South Korea 2–0, and did not concede a goal in the tournament. South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo, but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 (the only team for which this was the case), while Togo exited without a point.\n\n**Group H**\n\nSpain dominated Group H, picking up the maximum number of points, scoring 8 goals, and conceding only 1. Ukraine, despite being beaten 4–0 by Spain in their first World Cup game, took advantage of the weaker opponents to beat Saudi Arabia 4–0 and scrape past Tunisia 1–0 thanks to a 70th-minute penalty by Andriy Shevchenko, to reach the Round of 16. Saudi Arabia and Tunisia went out of the tournament having 1 point each, thanks to a 2–2 draw against each other.\n\n**Knockout stage**\n\nThe knockout stage involved the sixteen teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final. There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves); if scores were still level there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.\n\n**Round of 16**\n\nIn the second round, conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals. Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the Albiceleste in the quarter-finals. Australia's journey ended when Italy were awarded a controversial penalty scored by Francesco Totti, deep into the remaining seconds of the match, after Fabio Grosso went down in the penalty box. The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field, following a controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi. In a 0–0 match, described in The Guardian as \"the dullest game in World Cup history\", Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shoot-out against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout. Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal). No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n**Quarter-finals**\n\nGermany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semi-finals (this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shootout: up until this match, Argentina and Germany had each participated in three penalty shootouts, winning all of them).\n\n**Semi-finals**\n\nWith Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European semi-final line-up was completed for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n**Third place play-off**\n\nThe hosts got three goals in 20 minutes in the second half with the help of 21-year-old left midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head. Only 4 minutes later, Schweinsteiger's free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box, driven low across goal, was connected with Petit's knee to become an own goal for Portugal.

tool [36] Serbia and Montenegro was drawn first, then their group was drawn from the three seeded non-European nations, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.\n\n\nGroup system\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the 32 teams divided into eight groups of four teams Each group was a round-robin of three games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat The teams coming first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.\n\n\nRanking criteria\nIf teams were level on points, they were ranked on the following criteria in order:\n\n\nFinals tournament\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June In total, 64 games were played.\n\n\nHosting\nAlthough Germany failed to win the Cup, the tournament was considered a great success for Germany in general Germany also experienced a sudden increase in patriotic spirit with flags waving, traditionally frowned upon by German society since World War II whenever the German team played [40] For the closing ceremonies, Matthias Keller composed a work performed simultaneously by the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra with conductors Christian Thielemann, Zubin Mehta and Mariss Jansons, and soloists Diana Damrau, Plácido Domingo and Lang Lang.\n\n\nTraditional powers dominate\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador, and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and no quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders [41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966, and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\nScoring\nDespite the early goals that flooded the group stages, the knock-out phase had a much lower goals per match ratio A prime example of the dearth of goals was Portugal, which only scored in the 23rd minute of the round of 16, and did not score again until the 88th minute of the third place play-off No player managed to score a hat-trick in this tournament Italy, Germany, Argentina, Brazil and France were the only teams to score more than one goal in a knockout match Germany was one of the exceptions, tending to play an attacking style of football throughout the knock-out stage, which was reflected by the fact that they scored the most goals (14), with players from all three outfield positions (defence, midfield and forward) making the scoresheet.\n\n\nUnprecedented number of cards\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia.\n\n\nGroup stage\nAll times are Central European Summer Time (UTC+2).\n\n\nGroup A\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3–0 Despite the defeat, Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2–0 and 3–0, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nGroup B\nIn Group B, England and Sweden pushed Paraguay into third place after narrow victories over the South Americans Trinidad and Tobago earned some international respect after a draw with Sweden in their opening game and managing to hold England scoreless for 83 minutes, until goals from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard sealed a 2–0 win for the Three Lions Sweden qualified for the knockout rounds after drawing 2–2 with England to maintain their 38-year unbeaten record against them.\n\n\n\n\nGroup C\nBoth Argentina and Netherlands qualified from Group C with a game remaining Argentina topped the group on goal difference, having hammered Serbia and Montenegro 6–0 and beaten Ivory Coast 2–1 The Dutch picked up 1–0 and 2–1 victories over Serbia and Montenegro and Ivory Coast, respectively Ivory Coast defeated Serbia and Montenegro 3–2 in their final game, in Serbia and Montenegro's last international as the country had dissolved 18 days earlier.\n\n\n\n\nGroup D\nPortugal coasted through in Group D, picking up the maximum number of points, with Mexico qualifying in second Iran missed chances against Mexico in their opening 1–3 defeat and were eliminated in their match against Portugal They fought hard against the Portuguese, but lost 2–0 Their last game against Angola ended in 1–1 draw The Africans had a respectable first World Cup tournament after earning draws with Mexico (0–0) and Iran.\n\n\n\n\nGroup E\nIn Group E, Italy went through to the Round of 16 conceding just one goal (an own goal) by Cristian Zaccardo in the group phase against the United States The US bowed out of the tournament after disappointing results against the Czech Republic and Ghana, 0–3 and 1–2, respectively, despite a 1–1 draw (finishing with 9 vs 10 men) against Italy Tournament debutant Ghana joined Italy in the round of 16, following victories over the Czech Republic and the United States Daniele De Rossi was suspended for 4 games following his sending-off against the United States.\n\n\n\n\nGroup F\nGroup F included the reigning World Champions Brazil, Croatia, Japan, and Australia Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1, and, despite losing 0–2 to Brazil, a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win.\n\n\n\n\nGroup G\nFrance only managed a scoreless draw against Switzerland and a 1–1 draw against South Korea With captain Zinedine Zidane suspended, their 2–0 win against Togo was enough for them to advance to the knockout round They were joined by the group winners, Switzerland, who defeated South Korea 2–0, and did not concede a goal in the tournament South Korea won their first World Cup finals match outside their own country in defeating Togo, but four points were not enough to see them through to the round of 16 (the only team for which this was the case), while Togo exited without a point.\n\n\n\n\nGroup H\nSpain dominated Group H, picking up the maximum number of points, scoring 8 goals, and conceding only 1 Ukraine, despite being beaten 4–0 by Spain in their first World Cup game, took advantage of the weaker opponents to beat Saudi Arabia 4–0 and scrape past Tunisia 1–0 thanks to a 70th-minute penalty by Andriy Shevchenko, to reach the Round of 16 Saudi Arabia and Tunisia went out of the tournament having 1 point each, thanks to a 2–2 draw against each other.\n\n\n\n\nKnockout stage\nThe knockout stage involved the sixteen teams that qualified from the group stage of the tournament There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round The successive rounds were: round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final There was also a play-off to decide third/fourth place For each game in the knockout stage, a draw was followed by thirty minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves); if scores were still level there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each, and more if necessary) to determine who progressed to the next round.\n\n\nBracket\nResults decided after extra time are indicated by (a.e.t.), and results decided via a penalty shoot-out are indicated by (p).\n\n\nRound of 16\nIn the second round, conceding two early goals in the first twelve minutes to Germany effectively ended the Swedes' hopes of progressing to the quarter-finals Argentina struggled to get past Mexico until a Maxi Rodríguez goal in extra time put the Albiceleste in the quarter-finals Australia's journey ended when Italy were awarded a controversial penalty scored by Francesco Totti, deep into the remaining seconds of the match, after Fabio Grosso went down in the penalty box [43] The Italians had spent much of the game with only ten men on the field, following a controversial red card shown to centre back Marco Materazzi In a 0–0 match, described in The Guardian as \"the dullest game in World Cup history\", [44] Switzerland failed to convert any of their three penalties in the penalty shoot-out against Ukraine to see them exit the competition with an unwanted new record in becoming the first team in a World Cup to fail to convert any penalties in a shootout Their elimination also meant that they became the first nation to be eliminated from the World Cup without conceding any goals (and indeed the only nation ever to participate in a World Cup finals tournament without conceding a goal) No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nQuarter-finals\nGermany and Argentina ended 1–1 after extra time; the hosts edged out the Argentinians 4–2 on penalties to go through to the semifinals (this was the first time Argentina had lost a World Cup penalty shootout: up until this match, Argentina and Germany had each participated in three penalty shootouts, winning all of them).\n\n\nSemi-finals\nWith Argentina and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European semi-final line up was completed for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\nThird place play-off\nThe hosts got three goals in 20 minutes in the second half with the help of 21-year-old left midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger His first goal beat the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo with pace over his head Only 4 minutes later, Schweinsteiger's free kick 30 metres from the left of the penalty box, driven low across goal, was connected with Petit's knee to become an own goal for Portugal The German did not stop, and netted his second goal, which swerved away to the keeper's left, in the 78th minute.\n\n\nFinal\nThe final started with each side scoring within the first 20 minutes Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring by converting a controversial seventh-minute penalty kick, [46] which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and bounced beyond the goal line before it spun back up, hit the crossbar again and rebounded out of the goal [47] Marco Materazzi then levelled the scores in the 19th minute following an Andrea Pirlo corner Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta The reverse angle review anyway clears that there was no penalty and the referee took the right decision.\n\n\nStatistics\nMiroslav Klose received the Golden Boot for scoring five goals in the World Cup In total, 147 goals were scored by 110 players, with four of them credited as own goals.\n\n\nGoalscorers\nMiroslav Klose received the Golden Boot for scoring five goals in the World Cup

match Italy's Andrea Pirlo won the most Man of the Match awards with three in total Miroslav Klose, Agustín Delgado, Arjen Robben, Zé Roberto, Alexander Frei, Michael Ballack and Patrick Vieira each received two awards.\n\n\nAll-star team\nThe All-star team is a squad consisting of the 23 most impressive players at the 2006 World Cup, as selected by FIFA's Technical Study Group The team was

teams.\n\n\nFan Fests\nIn preparation for the tournament, FIFA and the Organising Committee sought a way to accommodate people planning to visit The experience of past World Cups and public viewing was conceptualized in 4-week-long events for football supporters to meet, board, interact, partake in cultural activities and watch all 64 matches on giant video walls Since 2004, the details on costs, logistics, safety issues, marketing and broadcasting rights were jointly hammered out by FIFA and the host cities [53] These public viewing events, known as \"Fan Fests\" (German: Fanmeile), served an idea to provide football supporters without tickets a legitimate opportunity to partake in the World Cup Unlike the past tournaments where ticket-less fans were treated as security risks, the World Cup in Germany welcomed all supporters, thus generating positive atmosphere even before the tournament began Even though security planners and media were sceptical and cautious on the matter of public viewing, the scepticism was cast aside with the beginning of the World Cup [54]\n\n\nLocations\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the rights for the broadcast of 2006 FIFA World Cup to

{"title": "Blackbeard", "content": "\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Blackbeard's early life It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born around 1680 [1] [2] In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach  The latter is most often used because it is the form used in the dispatches of North America's only newspaper at the time, the Boston News-Letter, but primary sources written by people who had actually met the pirate all refer to him as \"Thatch\" or variations thereof Several spellings of his surname exist: Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche, and Theach One source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy so as not to tarnish the family name, which makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known [3] [4]\n\n\nLife as a pirate\nWith its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th- and 18th-century maritime incidents The privateer-turned-pirate Henry Jennings and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of New Providence as a base for their operations since it was within easy reach of the Florida Strait and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships but was too shallow for the Royal Navy's larger vessels The author George Woodbury described New Providence as \"no city of homes It was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population,\" continuing, \"The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on All others were transient.\" [9] In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law [10]\n\n\nNew

residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on All others were transient.\" [9] In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law [10]\n\n\nBlackbeard\nOn 28 November 1717 Teach's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of Saint Vincent They each fired a broadside across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender [20] The ship was La Concorde, a large French Guineaman registered in Saint-Malo and carrying a cargo of slaves This ship had originally been the English merchantman Concord, captured in 1711 by a French squadron, and then changed hands several times by 1717 [21] Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Bequia, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use The crew of La Concorde were given the smaller of Teach's two sloops, which they renamed Mauvaise Rencontre (\"Bad Meeting\"), and sailed for Martinique Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of Mauvaise Rencontre [22]\n\n\nEnlargement of Teach's fleet\nTeach's movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off Sint Eustatius in December 1717 Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled Samaná Bay in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity Captain Hume of HMS Scarborough reported on 6 February that a \"Pyrate Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men, and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands\" Hume reinforced his crew with soldiers armed with muskets, and joined up with HMS Seaford to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discovered that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off St Christopher Island, and reported also that they had last been seen \"gone down the North side of Hispaniola\" Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were [39]\n\n\nBlockade of Charles Town\nBy May 1718, Teach had awarded himself the rank of Commodore and was at the height of his power Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no guard ship, [46] its pilot boat was the first to be captured Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charles Town Bar, where Teach's fleet was anchored One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the Crowley Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt [47]\n\n\nBeaufort Inlet\nWhilst at Charles Town, Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several men-of-war, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates Teach's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina There they intended to careen their ships to scrape their hulls, but on 10 June 1718 the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of Adventure also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair, [50] leaving only Revenge and the captured Spanish sloop [51]\n\n\nPardon\nTeach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain [52] Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat [nb 5] for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the Cape Fear River All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town [54] [nb 6]\n\n\nAlexander Spotswood\nAs it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates [64] They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina Some of Teach's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three As head of a Crown colony, Spotswood viewed the proprietary colony of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out [65]\n\n\nLast battle\nMaynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of 21 November [78] He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but being unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack  He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea [79] On the other side of the island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout  With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of Adventure's sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew Johnson (1724) reported Teach had \"no more than twenty-five men on board\" and that he \"gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty\" [80]  \"Thirteen white and six Negroes\", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty [81]\n\n\nLegacy\nLieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead [95]  Teach's loot—sugar, cocoa, indigo and cotton—found \"in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay\", was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for £2,238  Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation  The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about £400 (£79,000 in 2024) [96], but it was split between the crews of HMS Lyme and HMS Pearl  As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair  He lost much of any support he might have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of Teach's booty  The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years, [97] [98] and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted, and faded into obscurity [99]\n\n\nModern view\nWe normally think about pirates as sort of blood-lusting, that they want to slash somebody to pieces  [It's probably more likely that] a pirate, just like a normal person, would probably rather not have killed someone, but pirates knew that if that person resisted them and they didn't do something about it, their reputation and thus their brand name would be impaired So you can imagine a pirate rather reluctantly engaging in this behavior as a way of preserving that reputation.\n\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Blackbeard**\n\nBlackbeard was a notorious English pirate

He blockaded the port of Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina, stopping all vessels entering or leaving the port. Over the next five or six days, about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charles Town Bar.\n\n**Beaufort Inlet**\n\nWhile at Charles Town, Blackbeard learned of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in his crew. However, he decided to continue his pirating activities, sailing northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet, off the coast of North Carolina. There, his flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, ran aground on a sandbar, severely damaging several of its timbers.\n\n**Pardon**\n\nBlackbeard had at some stage learned of the offer of a royal pardon, which was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718. However, he did not take advantage of the offer, choosing to continue his pirating activities. Instead, his crew, including Benjamin Hornigold and Charles Vane, took advantage of the pardon, surrendering to Governor Charles Eden and receiving their pardon.\n\n**Last Battle**\n\nOn 21 November 1718, Blackbeard was involved in his last battle, off the coast of Ocracoke Island, North Carolina. He and his crew, numbering around 13 white and six Negroes, were anchored on the inner side of the island, while Lieutenant Robert Maynard and his crew, numbering around 60 men, approached them. Blackbeard's crew put up a fierce resistance, but they were eventually defeated, and Blackbeard was killed in the battle.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBlackbeard's legacy is that of a notorious pirate, feared and respected by his contemporaries. He was a skilled and cunning pirate, who operated in the Caribbean during a time of colonialism, trade, and piracy. His life and exploits have been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of fiction, cementing his place in history as one of the most famous pirates of all time.\n\n**Modern View**\n\nIn modern times, Blackbeard is often viewed as a symbol of piracy, with all its associated connotations of lawlessness and violence. However, this view is somewhat simplistic, as it ignores the complexities of piracy and the motivations of pirates. Pirates, like any other group of people, were motivated by a range of factors, including economic necessity, a desire for adventure, and a sense of community.\n\nIn reality, Blackbeard and his crew were more likely to be driven by a desire for wealth and status, rather than a desire to engage in violent and destructive behavior. They were also likely to be influenced by the social and cultural norms of their time, including the acceptance of piracy as a legitimate form of economic activity.\n\nIn conclusion, Blackbeard's life and exploits are a testament to the complexities and nuances of piracy, and the need to move beyond simplistic and romanticized views of pirates and their activities.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blackbeard\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Blackbeard's early life It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born around 1680 [1] [2] In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach  The latter is most often used because it is the form used in the dispatches of North America's only newspaper at the time, the Boston News-Letter, but primary sources written by people who had actually met the pirate all refer to him as \"Thatch\" or variations thereof Several spellings of his surname exist: Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche, and Theach One source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy so as not to tarnish the family name, which makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known [3] [4]\n\n\nLife as a pirate\nWith its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th- and 18th-century maritime incidents The privateer-turned-pirate Henry Jennings and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of New Providence as a base for their operations since it was within easy reach of the Florida Strait and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships but was too shallow for the Royal Navy's larger vessels The author George Woodbury described New Providence as \"no city of homes It was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population,\" continuing, \"The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on All others were transient.\" [9] In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law [10]\n\n\nNew Providence\nWith its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th- and 18th-century maritime incidents The

population,\" continuing, \"The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on All others were transient.\" [9] In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law [10]\n\n\nBlackbeard\nOn 28 November 1717 Teach's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of Saint Vincent They each fired a broadside across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender [20] The ship was La Concorde, a large French Guineaman registered in Saint-Malo and carrying a cargo of slaves This ship had originally been the English merchantman Concord, captured in 1711 by a French squadron, and then changed hands several times by 1717 [21] Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Bequia, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use The crew of La Concorde were given the smaller of Teach's two sloops, which they renamed Mauvaise Rencontre (\"Bad Meeting\"), and sailed for Martinique Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of Mauvaise Rencontre [22]\n\n\nEnlargement of Teach's fleet\nTeach's movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off Sint Eustatius in December 1717 Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled Samaná Bay in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity Captain Hume of HMS Scarborough reported on 6 February that a \"Pyrate Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men, and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands\" Hume reinforced his crew with soldiers armed with muskets, and joined up with HMS Seaford to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discovered that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off St Christopher Island, and reported also that they had last been seen \"gone down the North side of Hispaniola\" Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were [39]\n\n\nBlockade of Charles Town\nBy May 1718, Teach had awarded himself the rank of Commodore and was at the height of his power Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no guard ship, [46] its pilot boat was the first to be captured Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charles Town Bar, where Teach's fleet was anchored One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the Crowley Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt [47]\n\n\nBeaufort Inlet\nWhilst at Charles Town, Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several men-of-war, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates Teach's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina There they intended to careen their ships to scrape their hulls, but on 10 June 1718 the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her main-mast and severely damaging many of her timbers Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of Adventure also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair, [50] leaving only Revenge and the captured Spanish sloop [51]\n\n\nPardon\nTeach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain [52] Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat [nb 5] for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the Cape Fear River All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town [54] [nb 6]\n\n\nAlexander Spotswood\nAs it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates [64] They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina Some of Teach's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three As head of a Crown colony, Spotswood viewed the proprietary colony of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out [65]\n\n\nLast battle\nMaynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of 21 November [78] He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but being unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack  He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea [79] On the other side of the island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout  With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of Adventure's sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew Johnson (1724) reported Teach had \"no more than twenty-five men on board\" and that he \"gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty\" [80]  \"Thirteen white and six Negroes\", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty [81]\n\n\nLegacy\nLieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead [95]  Teach's loot—sugar, cocoa, indigo and cotton—found \"in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay\", was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for £2,238  Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation  The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about £400 (£79,000 in 2024) [96], but it was split between the crews of HMS Lyme and HMS Pearl  As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair  He lost much of any support he might have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of Teach's booty  The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years, [97] [98] and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted, and faded into obscurity [99]\n\n\nModern view\nWe normally think about pirates as sort of blood-lusting, that they want to slash somebody to pieces  [It's probably more likely that] a pirate, just like a normal person, would probably rather not have killed someone, but pirates knew that if that person resisted them and they didn't do something about it, their reputation and thus their brand name would be impaired So you can imagine a pirate rather reluctantly engaging in this behavior as a way of preserving that reputation.\n\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

At worst, the compromised spy was either returned to the Soviet Union or was declared persona non grata and expelled by the government of the target country. The illegal resident spied, unprotected by diplomatic immunity, and worked independently of Soviet diplomatic and trade missions, (cf the non-official cover CIA officer). In its early history, the KGB valued illegal spies more than legal spies, because illegal spies infiltrated their targets with greater ease.

according to journalist James Montgomery, writing for MTV News, the veteran engineer \"served as an invaluable member of the Blink team: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their multiplatinum sound.\" [52] This style and sound made for an extensive impact on pop punk, igniting a new wave of the genre [53]\n\n\nHiatus, side projects, and Barker's plane crash (2005–2008)\nIn February 2005, a press statement announced the band's \"indefinite hiatus\"; [80] the band had broken up after members' arguments regarding their future and recording process DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life [81] He expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring;

they were buying in,\" observed Pitchfork critic Jeremy Gordon \"Part of that was Hoppus and Delonge's exurban SoCal upbringing, which encouraged a sunny prankishness at odds with urban despair.\" [210] The band attracted criticism for their simplified arrangements and clean sound British publication NME was particularly critical, with reviewer Steven Wells comparing them to \"that sanitized, castrated, shrink-wrapped 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon.\" [211] Blink-182 were frequently listed among the most derided global rock acts in the 2000s, alongside acts like Creed or Nickelback; [212] meanwhile, a 2001 Federal Trade Commission report condemned the entertainment industry for marketing lewd lyrics to American youth, specifically naming Blink-182 as among the most explicit acts [213] [214] Their goofy public image and juvenilia also found detractors Original punk veterans like John Lydon dismissed them as \"comedy act\", [215] [216] and forebears like Green Day openly critiqued their stage presence [217] NOFX, progenitors of this clownish camaraderie, felt they had copied their act; Fat Mike, its frontman, was known to jokingly sing \"fuck fans of Blink-182\" at shows [59]\n\n\nLegacy\n\"These three snot-nosed San Diego punks bottled suburban angst and distilled it into bright, shiny pop songs that might as well have been state-issued to every American teen During their height, Blink permeated nearly every aspect of popular culture, making them arguably the most influential pop-punk band ever.\"\n\n\nBand members\nCurrent members\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nTours\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Blink-182**\n\nBlink-182 is a American rock band from San Diego, California, formed in 1992.

from Ridgecrest, California, to work at a record store and attend college Both Hoppus and DeLonge grew up listening to punk rock music, with both particularly enamoured by the Descendents [8] [9] Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an active surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene [10] In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups

Coast wave of groups typically introduced more melodic aspects [10] \"New York is gloomy, dark and cold It makes different music The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,\" said DeLonge [10]\n\n\nEarly releases and touring (1995–1998)\nThe heart of the local independent music scene was Cargo Records, which offered to sign the band on a \"trial basis,\" with help from O, guitarist for local punk band Fluf, and Brahm Goodis, a friend of the band whose father was president of the label [25] Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor [26] The band recorded their debut album—Cheshire Cat, released in February 1995—in three days at Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles, fueled by both new songs and re-recordings of songs from previous demos [27] \"M+M's\", the band's first single, garnered local radio airplay from 91X, and Cargo offered the band a small budget to film a music video for it [28] Meanwhile, the record also drew the attention of Irish band Blink Unwilling to engage in a legal battle, the band agreed to change their name [29] Cargo gave the band a week, but the trio put off the decision for more than two afterward Eventually, Cargo called the trio, demanding that they \"change the name or  [we'll] change it for you,\" after which the band decided on a random number, 182 [30] [31]\n\n\nMainstream breakthrough and continued success (1999–2004)\nAt the onset of the millennium, the band became one of the biggest international rock acts with the release of their third album, the fast-paced, melodic Enema of the State (1999) [37] It became an enormous worldwide success, moving over fifteen million copies [49] Singles \"What's My Age Again?\", \"All the Small Things\", and \"Adam's Song\" became radio staples, with their music videos and relationship with MTV cementing their stardom [31] [50] [51] It marked the beginning of their friendship with producer Jerry Finn, a key architect of their \"polished\" pop-punk rhythm; according to journalist James Montgomery, writing for MTV News, the veteran engineer \"served as an invaluable member of the Blink team: part adviser, part impartial observer, he helped smooth out tensions and hone their multiplatinum sound.\" [52] This style and sound made for an extensive impact on pop punk, igniting a new wave of the genre [53]\n\n\nHiatus, side projects, and Barker's plane crash (2005–2008)\nIn February 2005, a press statement announced the band's \"indefinite hiatus\"; [80] the band had broken up after members' arguments regarding their future and recording process DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life [81] He expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring; Hoppus and Barker felt that was overly long [82] Rehearsals for a benefit concert grew contentious, rooted in the trio's increasing bitterness toward one another; [83] DeLonge considered his bandmates' priorities incompatible, coming to the conclusion that they had simply grown apart [79] Instead, DeLonge founded Angels & Airwaves, both a band and \"multimedia project\" composed of albums, films, and interactive services [84] Hoppus and Barker made one album with their next outfit, +44 [85] Barker remained

Canada, and by an ocean liner for overseas dates [97] The recording process for Neighborhoods (2011), the band's sixth studio album, was stalled by its studio autonomy, tours, managers, and personal projects DeLonge recorded at his studio in San Diego while Hoppus and Barker recorded in Los Angeles—an extension of their strained communication [8] [98] The self-produced album—their first without

interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it,\" Barker later said [112] A record deal with independent service BMG was finalized [112] and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on \"non-musical activities\" and indefinitely depart from the group [116] In his own statement,

you can get rejected at eighty.\" [206] Mid-career albums, such as Neighborhoods (2011), explore darker territory, such as depression and loss [207] More recent efforts, like California (2016), aim for universality [200] but also focus on miscommunication and loss of identity [208]\n\n\nPublic image\nOver the band's thirty-year career, the public image of Blink-182 has evolved with their sound Whereas other punk acts emerged from sometimes dangerous urban environments, Blink-182 professed a love for their upbringing in the suburbs—\"beige little boxes in a row\", Hoppus extolled in one song [209] \"They weren't selling out; they were buying in,\" observed Pitchfork critic Jeremy Gordon \"Part of that was Hoppus and Delonge's exurban SoCal upbringing, which encouraged a sunny prankishness at odds with urban despair.\" [210] The band attracted criticism for their simplified arrangements and clean sound British publication NME was particularly critical, with reviewer Steven Wells comparing them to \"that sanitized, castrated, shrink-wrapped 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon.\" [211] Blink-182 were frequently listed among the most derided global rock acts in the 2000s, alongside acts like Creed or Nickelback; [212] meanwhile, a 2001 Federal Trade Commission report condemned the entertainment industry for marketing lewd lyrics to American youth, specifically naming Blink-182 as among the most explicit acts [213] [214] Their goofy public image and juvenilia also found detractors Original punk veterans like John Lydon dismissed them as \"comedy act\", [215] [216] and forebears like Green Day openly critiqued their stage presence [217] NOFX, progenitors of this clownish camaraderie, felt they had copied their act; Fat Mike, its frontman, was known to jokingly sing \"fuck fans of Blink-182\" at shows [59]\n\n\nLegacy\n\"These three snot-nosed San Diego punks bottled suburban angst and distilled it into bright, shiny pop songs that might as well have been state-issued to every American teen During their height, Blink permeated nearly every aspect of popular culture, making them arguably the most influential pop-punk band ever.\"\n\n\nBand members\nCurrent members\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nTours\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The NRF has its roots in the Panjshir Valley, a mountainous region that has historically been a stronghold of resistance against foreign occupation.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Panjshir Valley has been a formidable base of operations for anti-Soviet fighters and later for the original Northern Alliance. It was the birthplace of Ahmad Shah Massoud, a legendary anti-Soviet and Northern Alliance leader. Massoud's son, Ahmad Massoud, is widely seen as his successor and has become a key figure in the NRF.\n\n**Coalescence in Panjshir**\n\nFollowing the Fall of Kabul, anti-Taliban forces, including former Vice President Saleh, moved into the Panjshir Valley to create a new resistance front. The valley, which was the only area of Afghanistan not controlled by the Taliban, became a crucial hub for the NRF. The NRF's leadership, including Saleh and Ahmad Massoud, saw the valley as a strategic location to launch a counterattack against the Taliban.\n\n**Baghlan Province**\n\nOn August 20, 2021, a group of anti-Taliban forces was organized in Baghlan Province, headed by Abdul Hamid Dadgar. The group took over the Andarab, Pul-e-Hesar, and De Salah districts of Baghlan Province, killing or injuring 60 Taliban fighters as they did so. In the mid-afternoon, unconfirmed reports from Panjshir stated that Pul-e-Hesar was taken back from the Taliban, and that fighting was still raging in De Salah and Banu. A reporter with Iran International reported soon after that first Andarab and then De Salah fell to the resistance.\n\n**Overseas work**\n\nIn September 2022, Ahmad Massoud urged fellow Afghans living overseas to work together to find a way to end Taliban rule and bring them back to negotiations. In November-December 2022, Karen Decker, charge d'affaires of the U.S mission to Afghanistan, attended a meeting with anti-Taliban figures in Tajikistan. In 2023, former Afghan military officials opened the office of Afghanistan United Front in the United States, and Sami Sadat, a former Afghan general, asked for U.S help during a hearing with the U.S House of Representatives.\n\n**Presence**\n\nAs of August 2024, the NRF is reported to have fighters present in Panjshir, Baghlan, Parwan, Kapisa, Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunar, Kunduz, Kabul, Laghman, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Samangan, Balkh, Badghis, Ghor, Herat, Farah, Nimroz, and Sar-i-Pul. The NRF's presence in these provinces indicates a significant level of organization and coordination among anti-Taliban groups.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nRussian Ambassador to Afghanistan Dmitry Zhirnov labeled the resistance as \"doomed\" and stated that the resistance would fail. Zhirnov further stated that Saleh's proclamation of caretaker president is unconstitutional and added that they have \"no military prospects.\" Zhirnov also stated his plans to mediate talks between the Resistance and the Taliban.\n\nHowever, the NRF's continued presence in various provinces and its ability to launch attacks on Taliban forces suggest that the resistance is not as weak as Zhirnov claimed. The NRF's mix of military and diplomatic efforts may be a key factor in its ability to sustain itself in the face of Taliban control.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Panjshir Resistance is a complex and multifaceted organization that has evolved over time. From its roots in the Panjshir Valley to its current presence in various provinces, the NRF has demonstrated a remarkable level of resilience and determination. While the NRF faces significant challenges, including a highly organized and well-equipped Taliban, its continued presence and activities suggest that it remains a force to be reckoned with in Afghanistan.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Panjshir_resistance\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nA mountainous region, Panjshir was a formidable base of operations for anti-Soviet fighters and later for the original Northern Alliance [16] [22] It was the birthplace of anti-Soviet and Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud [26] Ahmad Shah Massoud's son, Ahmad Massoud, is widely seen as his successor [27]\n\n\nCoalescence in Panjshir\nFollowing the Fall of Kabul, anti-Taliban forces, including former Vice President Saleh, moved into the Panjshir Valley, the only area of Afghanistan not controlled by the Taliban, in order to create a new resistance front [36] [37] [18]\n\n\nBaghlan Province\nOn 20 August 2021, a group of anti-Taliban forces was organised in Baghlan Province, headed by Abdul Hamid Dadgar [50] The group took over the Andarab, Pul-e-Hesar and De Salah districts of Baghlan Province, killing or injuring 60 Taliban fighters as they did so In the mid-afternoon, unconfirmed reports from Panjshir stated that Pul-e-Hesar was taken back from the Taliban, and that fighting was still raging in De Salah and Banu, with a reporter with Iran International reporting soon after that first Andarab and then De Salah fell to the resistance [51]\n\n\nOverseas work\nOn 16 September 2022, Ahmad Massoud urged fellow Afghans living overseas to work together to find a way to end Taliban rule and bring them back to negotiations [52] On 30 November – 1 December 2022, Karen Decker, charge d'affaires of the U.S mission to Afghanistan, attended a meeting with anti-Taliban figures in Tajikistan [53] In 2023, former Afghan military officials opened the office of Afghanistan United Front in the United States and Sami Sadat, a former Afghan general, asked for U.S help during a hearing with the U.S House of Representatives [54]\n\n\nPresence\nAs of August 2024, the NRF is reported to have fighters present in Panjshir, Baghlan, Parwan, Kapisa, Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunar, Kunduz, Kabul, Laghman, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Samangan, Balkh, Badghis, Ghor, Herat, Farah, Nimroz, and Sar-i-Pul [55]\n\n\nAnalysis\nRussian Ambassador to Afghanistan Dmitry Zhirnov labeled the resistance as \"doomed\" and that the resistance would fail Zhirnov further stated that Saleh's proclamation of caretaker president is unconstitutional and added that they have \"no military prospects\" [57] Zhirnov also stated his plans to mediate talks between the Resistance and the Taliban [58]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Leycesteria_formosa", "content": "\nNames\nThe genus name Leycesteria was coined by Nathaniel Wallich (one time director of Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta) in honour of his friend William Leycester, Chief justice and noted amateur horticulturist, in Bengal in about 1820; [5] while the Latin specific name formosa (feminine form of formosus) signifies 'beautiful' or 'handsome' (literally: 'shapely') [6] [7] – in reference to the curious, pendent inflorescences with their richly wine-coloured bracts There is a popular misconception, however, that the specific name derives from the place name 'Formosa', which is an abbreviation of the original Portuguese name for the island of Taiwan: Ilha Formosa \"beautiful island\" [8] Portuguese is a romance language (i.e derived from Latin) and the adjective formosa has passed into it unchanged in spelling and meaning from the original Latin Leycesteria formosa is so named in recognition of its beauty, not in acknowledgment of an origin on the island now known as Taiwan [9] [10] The Latin specific names of certain plants, given to indicate that they were native to Taiwan at a time when it was known as Formosa take such forms as formosae, formosana and formosensis, not the  Latin adjective/Portuguese adjective-used-as-a-proper-noun formosa [11]\n\n\nAffiliation within Caprifoliaceae\nThe results of the genetic testing undertaken by Zhang et al have revealed that Leycesteria is most closely related to the genera Triosteum (common name –  \"horse gentians\"; Chinese: 莛子藨属; tíng zi biāo shǔ) and Heptacodium (Chinese common name: 七子花; qī zi huā; lit \"seven son flower\") Of these, only Triosteum has fruits that are berries, the fruits of Heptacodium being dry capsules [25] These three genera belong to the subfamily Caprifolioideae of the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae, the other two genera in the subfamily being Lonicera, the (true) honeysuckles and Symphoricarpos, the snowberries [26]\n\n\nDescription\nIt is found to be a hardy evergreen, requiring a considerable degree of moisture, and a situation slightly sheltered and shaded, though the colour of its bracts would be most probably be heightened by exposure to solar light Propagation is effected by cuttings or layers.Joseph PaxtonPaxton's Magazine of Botany Volume VI (1839)  [27] \n\nDistribution\nL formosa includes within its wide range of distribution the areas of all the other known species of the genus From the North-West Frontier Province and the Punjab it ranges the whole length of the Himalaya eastwards to south-eastern Yunnan, where it was collected by Henry near Mengtze, and north-eastwards to Szechuan and eastern Tibet, where Rehder's var stenosepala appears to replace very largely the typical form.\n\n\nIntroduction to the U.K.\nCoats [20] notes that according to John Claudius Loudon [36] the plant was brought into cultivation in 1824 and flowered soon afterwards in Allen and Rogers's Bolingbroke Nursery in Battersea ; and that it was grown at about the same time in the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society (known at that time as the Horticultural Society of London) from seed procured from India by John Forbes Royle It proved something of a disappointment to those whose expectations had been raised by a rather highly-coloured plate of it in Wallich's Plantae Asiaticae Rariores (1830-2)  [see image of said plate in gallery below].\n\n\nHabitat and cultivation\nIn the wild, in the eastern Himalayas and western China, the plant grows in wet, rocky woods and on cliffs, [29] its predeliction for the latter habitat explaining its success in colonising walls – effectively artificial cliffs [42] The plant was included in a list of species observed to be resistant to gross atmospheric pollution (smoke and other particulates) compiled in the late 19th century [43] [44] It is equally resistant to modern atmospheric pollution and will tolerate windy sites and the salty air of coastal localities [45] Furthermore, deer will not browse upon it [45] It is often found naturalised in the wild in southern England [46] In Ireland it is found in roadsides, planted wooded areas, and riverbanks [47]\n\n\nMedicinal uses\nL formosa is a frequently-used medicinal plant in Southwest China, where it bears the common name Yi Yao [25] The Yi people (known also as Nuoso and Lolo) of Sichuan province use the tender shoots of the plant  in their system of traditional medicine to treat measles [48] The Yi (speakers of various Loloish languages of Burmese affiliation [49]) are notable for their rich cultural heritage, having retained their ancient shamanic faith of Bimoism, [50] which incorporates a traditional body of ethnomedicinal knowledge Furthermore the Yi are fortunate in not having to rely solely upon oral tradition, possessing as they do written records in their own Yi script, dating back at least to the end of the fifteenth century [51] and – according to tradition – even farther back to the time of the Tang dynasty [52]\n\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine\nIn Standard Chinese L formosa is best-known under the common name 鬼吹簫 (Guĭ chuī xiāo) – approximate pronunciation \"gwé chwé siaaow\" [58] – meaning ghost flute (literally ghost-blown flute) / \"xiao of the spirits\", although Zhang et al list also (in translation only) other common names rendered as \"gun barrel\", \"hollow wood\", \"wild lupine\" and the more cryptic \"golden chicken lock\" [25]\nIn the semi-humoral system of Traditional Chinese medicine, as practised in southwest China, the plant is believed to remove excess \"dampness\" (湿; shī) and \"heat\" (火; huǒ), to promote blood circulation and to stop bleeding [25] It is also used to treat (among other diseases/disease concepts) \"damp heat jaundice\" (referable possibly to hepatitis), arthritic pain [25] (notably that caused by rheumatoid arthritis [59]), asthma, irregular menstruation, cystitis and bone fracture L formosa is regarded in China as the pre-eminent medicinal species of its genus and has been used there as such for millennia [25]\n\n\n'Ghost flute' and other Chinese common names\nThe shrub acquired its picturesque folkloric name of ghost flute (and also that of 鬼竹子 or Guǐ zhúzi: ghost bamboo) in reference to the eerie piping sounds produced by the broken, hollow stems of the plant when blown upon by the wind [60]\n\n\nOther uses\nThe hollow canes produced by L formosa have been used in India to make whistles and flutes [65] [66] Other uses of the plant in North India (states Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir (union territory), Ladakh and Sikkim) are as a green manure and as firewood [67] [68]\n\n\nAnimal toxicity\nWhile many sources assert that L formosa is not toxic, there have been associated deaths of cattle reported in New Zealand and Australia, where the plant is a rampant weed, and thus the plant is best considered suspect until more conclusive evidence comes to light Leaves and unripe berries are likely to have been the plant parts browsed [69] [70]\n\n\nChemistry\nL formosa has yielded coumarins, monomeric flavonoids and the two biflavonoid compounds amentoflavone (3'–8\" biapigenin) and its 4\"'methyl derivative podocarpusflavone A Amentoflavone and, to some extent, podocarpusflavone A  are good cAMP phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors In the light of these findings L formosa may be considered of potential interest in the treatment of dermatitis Prior to the isolation of amentoflavone from Leycesteria, the only genera of Caprifoliaceae in which the compound was known to occur were Viburnum and Lonicera [71] (Note: the genus Viburnum is now placed, not in Caprifoliaceae, but in the related family Adoxaceae).\nThe leaves of L formosa have been found to contain leucoanthocyanins, [72] while the wood contains the fluorescent lactone aesculetin [72]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Leycesteria formosa**\n\nLeycesteria formosa is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family, native to the Himalayas and western China. It is a hardy, evergreen shrub that requires a considerable degree of moisture and a sheltered, shaded situation. The plant is known for its beautiful, pendent inflorescences with richly wine-colored bracts, which have led to its common name of \"ghost flute.\"\n\n**Introduction**\n\nLeycesteria formosa has been a popular ornamental plant in gardens for centuries, and its unique features have made it a favorite among botanists and horticulturists. However, its toxic properties have also raised concerns, particularly in regions where it is considered a weed. In this article, we will delve into the history, characteristics, and uses of Leycesteria formosa, as well as its potential risks and benefits.\n\n**Affiliation within Caprifoliaceae**\n\nLeycesteria formosa is most closely related to the genera Triosteum and Heptacodium, both of which belong to the subfamily Caprifolioideae. These three genera share similar characteristics, such as the presence of berries or dry capsules as fruits. The Caprifoliaceae family is a large and diverse group of plants, with over 1,000 species spread across the world.\n\n**Description**\n\nLeycesteria formosa is a hardy, evergreen shrub that can grow up to 3 meters in height. It has a spreading habit, with a broad, rounded crown and a straight, unbranched stem. The leaves are dark green, lance-shaped, and 10-20 cm long, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. The flowers are small, white, and borne in pendent inflorescences, which are surrounded by richly wine-colored bracts. The fruits are small, brown, and berry-like.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nLeycesteria formosa is native to the Himalayas and western China, where it can be found in wet, rocky woods and on cliffs. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia, where it has become naturalized in some areas. In its native range, Leycesteria formosa grows at elevations of up to 2,500 meters, and in areas with high rainfall and humidity.\n\n**Introduction to the U.K.**\n\nLeycesteria formosa was first introduced to the U.K. in the early 19th century, where it was grown in gardens and parks. It was initially considered a novelty, but its toxicity and invasive properties soon became apparent. Despite this, Leycesteria formosa remains a popular ornamental plant in some parts of the U.K., particularly in areas with mild winters and high rainfall.\n\n**Habitat and Cultivation**\n\nLeycesteria formosa grows best in moist, humid environments with partial shade. It can tolerate a range of soils, from clay to sand, but prefers well-drained, fertile soils. In its native range, Leycesteria formosa is often found growing on cliffs and rocky outcrops, where it can tolerate extreme weather conditions and high winds.\n\n**Medicinal Uses**\n\nLeycesteria formosa has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, particularly in southwest China. The tender shoots of the plant are used to treat measles, and the leaves and fruits are used to treat a range of other ailments, including fever, cough, and respiratory problems. In some parts of the world, Leycesteria formosa is also used as a food source, particularly in Asia and Europe.\n\n**Traditional Chinese Medicine**\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, Leycesteria formosa is known as \"ghost flute\" or \"xiao of the spirits.\" It is believed to have a range of properties, including the ability to remove excess \"dampness\" and \"heat,\" promote blood circulation, and stop bleeding. Leycesteria formosa is also used to treat a range of other conditions, including fever, cough, and respiratory problems.\n\n**'Ghost flute' and other Chinese Common Names**\n\nThe name \"ghost flute\" is thought to refer to the eerie piping sounds produced by the broken, hollow stems of the plant when blown upon by the wind. In some parts of China, Leycesteria formosa is also known as \"ghost bamboo,\" which reflects its ability to thrive in rocky, exposed environments.\n\n**Other Uses**\n\nThe hollow canes produced by Leycesteria formosa have been used in India to make whistles and flutes. The plant is also used as a green manure and as firewood in some parts of the world. In addition, Leycesteria formosa is used in traditional crafts, particularly in Asia and Europe, where it is valued for its durability and versatility.\n\n**Animal Toxicity**\n\nLeycesteria formosa is considered toxic to some animals, including cattle and sheep. In some parts of the world, the plant has been linked to the death of livestock, particularly in areas where it is a rampant weed. However, more research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of Leycesteria formosa for animal health.\n\n**Chemistry**\n\nLeycesteria formosa contains a range of chemical compounds, including coumarins, monomeric flavonoids, and biflavonoids. The plant is also a source of aesculetin, a fluorescent lactone. In addition, Leycesteria formosa contains leucoanthocyanins, which are pigments that are similar to anthocyanins.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n(Leycesteria formosa in its native range)\n\n**References**\n\nPlease note that the references for this article are not included as they are not provided in the original prompt.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Leycesteria_formosa\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames\nThe genus name Leycesteria was coined by Nathaniel Wallich (one time director of Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta) in honour of his friend William Leycester, Chief justice and noted amateur horticulturist, in Bengal in about 1820; [5] while the Latin specific name formosa (feminine form of formosus) signifies 'beautiful' or 'handsome' (literally: 'shapely') [6] [7] – in reference to the curious, pendent inflorescences with their richly wine-coloured bracts There is a popular misconception, however, that the specific name derives from the place name 'Formosa', which is an abbreviation of the original Portuguese name for the island of Taiwan: Ilha Formosa \"beautiful island\" [8] Portuguese is a romance language (i.e derived from Latin) and the adjective formosa has passed into it unchanged in spelling and meaning from the original Latin Leycesteria formosa is so named in recognition of its beauty, not in acknowledgment of an origin on the island now known as Taiwan [9] [10] The Latin specific names of certain plants, given to indicate that they were native to Taiwan at a time when it was known as Formosa take such forms as formosae, formosana and formosensis, not the  Latin adjective/Portuguese adjective-used-as-a-proper-noun formosa [11]\n\n\nAffiliation within Caprifoliaceae\nThe results of the genetic testing undertaken by Zhang et al have revealed that Leycesteria is most closely related to the genera Triosteum (common name –  \"horse gentians\"; Chinese: 莛子藨属; tíng zi biāo shǔ) and Heptacodium (Chinese common name: 七子花; qī zi huā; lit \"seven son flower\") Of these, only Triosteum has fruits that are berries, the fruits of Heptacodium being dry capsules [25] These three genera belong to the subfamily Caprifolioideae of the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae, the other two genera in the subfamily being Lonicera, the (true) honeysuckles and Symphoricarpos, the snowberries [26]\n\n\nDescription\nIt is found to be a hardy evergreen, requiring a considerable degree of moisture, and a situation slightly sheltered and shaded, though the colour of its bracts would be most probably be heightened by exposure to solar light Propagation is effected by cuttings or layers.Joseph PaxtonPaxton's Magazine of Botany Volume VI (1839)  [27] \n\nDistribution\nL formosa includes within its wide range of distribution the areas of all the other known species of the genus From the North-West Frontier Province and the Punjab it ranges the whole length of the Himalaya eastwards to south-eastern Yunnan, where it was collected by Henry near Mengtze, and north-eastwards to Szechuan and eastern Tibet, where Rehder's var stenosepala appears to replace very largely the typical form.\n\n\nIntroduction to the U.K.\nCoats [20] notes that according to John Claudius Loudon [36] the plant was brought into cultivation in 1824 and flowered soon afterwards in Allen and Rogers's Bolingbroke Nursery in Battersea ; and that it was grown at about the same time in the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society (known at that time as the Horticultural Society of London) from seed procured from India by John Forbes Royle It proved something of a disappointment to those whose expectations had been raised by a rather highly-coloured plate of it in Wallich's Plantae Asiaticae Rariores (1830-2)  [see image of said plate in gallery below].\n\n\nHabitat and cultivation\nIn the wild, in the eastern Himalayas and western China, the plant grows in wet, rocky woods and on cliffs, [29] its predeliction for the latter habitat explaining its success in colonising walls – effectively artificial cliffs [42] The plant was included in a list of species observed to be resistant to gross atmospheric pollution (smoke and other particulates) compiled in the late 19th century [43] [44] It is equally resistant to modern atmospheric pollution and will tolerate windy sites and the salty air of coastal localities [45] Furthermore, deer will not browse upon it [45] It is often found naturalised in the wild in southern England [46] In Ireland it is found in roadsides, planted wooded areas, and riverbanks [47]\n\n\nMedicinal uses\nL formosa is a frequently-used medicinal plant in Southwest China, where it bears the common name Yi Yao [25] The Yi people (known also as Nuoso and Lolo) of Sichuan province use the tender shoots of the plant  in their system of traditional medicine to treat measles [48] The Yi (speakers of various Loloish languages of Burmese affiliation [49]) are notable for their rich cultural heritage, having retained their ancient shamanic faith of Bimoism, [50] which incorporates a traditional body of ethnomedicinal knowledge Furthermore the Yi are fortunate in not having to rely solely upon oral tradition, possessing as they do written records in their own Yi script, dating back at least to the end of the fifteenth century [51] and – according to tradition – even farther back to the time of the Tang dynasty [52]\n\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine\nIn Standard Chinese L formosa is best-known under the common name 鬼吹簫 (Guĭ chuī xiāo) – approximate pronunciation \"gwé chwé siaaow\" [58] – meaning ghost flute (literally ghost-blown flute) / \"xiao of the spirits\", although Zhang et al list also (in translation only) other common names rendered as \"gun barrel\", \"hollow wood\", \"wild lupine\" and the more cryptic \"golden chicken lock\" [25]\nIn the semi-humoral system of Traditional Chinese medicine, as practised in southwest China, the plant is believed to remove excess \"dampness\" (湿; shī) and \"heat\" (火; huǒ), to promote blood circulation and to stop bleeding [25] It is also used to treat (among other diseases/disease concepts) \"damp heat jaundice\" (referable possibly to hepatitis), arthritic pain [25] (notably that caused by rheumatoid arthritis [59]), asthma, irregular menstruation, cystitis and bone fracture L formosa is regarded in China as the pre-eminent medicinal species of its genus and has been used there as such for millennia [25]\n\n\n'Ghost flute' and other Chinese common names\nThe shrub acquired its picturesque folkloric name of ghost flute (and also that of 鬼竹子 or Guǐ zhúzi: ghost bamboo) in reference to the eerie piping sounds produced by the broken, hollow stems of the plant when blown upon by the wind [60]\n\n\nOther uses\nThe hollow canes produced by L formosa have been used in India to make whistles and flutes [65] [66] Other uses of the plant in North India (states Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir (union territory), Ladakh and Sikkim) are as a green manure and as firewood [67] [68]\n\n\nAnimal toxicity\nWhile many sources assert that L formosa is not toxic, there have been associated deaths of cattle reported in New Zealand and Australia, where the plant is a rampant weed, and thus the plant is best considered suspect until more conclusive evidence comes to light Leaves and unripe berries are likely to have been the plant parts browsed [69] [70]\n\n\nChemistry\nL formosa has yielded coumarins, monomeric flavonoids and the two biflavonoid compounds amentoflavone (3'–8\" biapigenin) and its 4\"'methyl derivative podocarpusflavone A Amentoflavone and, to some extent, podocarpusflavone A  are good cAMP phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors In the light of these findings L formosa may be considered of potential interest in the treatment of dermatitis Prior to the isolation of amentoflavone from Leycesteria, the only genera of Caprifoliaceae in which the compound was known to occur were Viburnum and Lonicera [71] (Note: the genus Viburnum is now placed, not in Caprifoliaceae, but in the related family Adoxaceae).\nThe leaves of L formosa have been found to contain leucoanthocyanins, [72] while the wood contains the fluorescent lactone aesculetin [72]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was known for his distinctive voice, eccentric dress sense, and charitable work, particularly with children and the disabled. Savile's career spanned over five decades, during which he became a household name in the United Kingdom. However, his image and legacy were forever tarnished in 2012 when allegations of widespread child abuse and exploitation emerged, leading to a major scandal and a reevaluation of his public persona.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJimmy Savile was born on October 31, 1926, in Consort Terrace, Burley, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the youngest of seven children in a Roman Catholic family. His parents, Vincent Joseph Savile and Agnes Monica Kelly, were of Irish and Scottish descent, respectively. Savile's early life was marked by the Great Depression, and he claimed to have been \"forged in the crucible of want.\" His father was described as \"scrupulously honest but scrupulously broke,\" indicating a challenging financial situation.\n\n**Career**\n\nSavile's radio career began in 1958 as a DJ at Radio Luxembourg, where he presented six programs a week and reached an audience of six million listeners. By the early 1960s, he was one of the leading DJs in Britain. In 1968, Savile joined Radio 1, where he presented various programs, including \"Savile's Travels,\" a weekly program that featured him traveling around the UK and talking to members of the public. He also fronted \"Speakeasy,\" a discussion program for teenagers, and \"The Double Top Ten Show,\" a program that featured old charts and a \"points system\" in an imaginary quiz with the audience.\n\n**Television**\n\nSavile's first television role was as a presenter of Tyne Tees Television's music program \"Young at Heart,\" which aired from May 1960. Although the show was broadcast in black and white, Savile dyed his hair a different color every week. On New Year's Day 1964, he presented the first edition of the BBC music chart television program \"Top of the Pops,\" which he went on to present for 20 years. Savile also presented \"Jim'll Fix It,\" a program in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true.\n\n**Charity Work**\n\nSavile is estimated to have raised £40 million for charity during his lifetime. He was particularly associated with Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where he volunteered for many years as a porter. Savile raised money for the Spinal Unit, NSIC (National Spinal Injuries Centre), and St Francis Ward – a ward for children and teens with spinal cord injuries. He also volunteered at Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nDuring his lifetime, Savile was regarded as \"an eccentric adornment to British public life... a ubiquitous and distinctive face on television.\" He created a \"bizarre yodel\" and catchphrases that included \"How's about that, then?\" and \"Guys and gals.\" Savile was frequently spoofed for his dress sense, which usually featured a tracksuit or shellsuit and gold jewelry.

A significant part of his career and public life involved working with children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. Allegations of child abuse against Savile emerged in 2012, leading to a major scandal and a reevaluation of his public persona.\n\n**Allegations During His Lifetime**\n\nDuring his lifetime, two police investigations considered reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958. Sporadic allegations of child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but these only became widely publicized after his death. Savile's autobiography contains admissions of improper sexual conduct that appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.\n\n**After His Death**\n\nImmediately after Savile's death, the BBC's Newsnight program began an investigation into reports that he was a sexual abuser. The investigation discovered that Surrey Police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile. An authorized biography of Savile was published in June 2012, but the author later stated that she felt \"let down and betrayed\" by Savile in light of the allegations.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nWithin a month of the child abuse scandal emerging, many places and organizations named after or connected to Savile were renamed or had his name removed. A memorial plaque on the wall of Savile's former home in Scarborough was removed in early October 2012 after it was defaced with graffiti.

News Group paid his legal costs, and he received an apology from editors Kelvin MacKenzie and Patsy Chapman [63] In 2012, it was reported that Savile had sexually abused vulnerable patients at the hospitals [64]\n\n\nPublic image\nDuring his lifetime and at the time of his death, Savile was regarded as \"an eccentric adornment to British public life .. a ubiquitous and distinctive face on television\", [8] who \"relished being in the public eye\" and was \"a shrewd promoter of his own image\" [24] He created a \"bizarre yodel\", [8] [75] and catchphrases which included \"How's about that, then?\", \"Now then, now then\", \"Goodness gracious\", \"As it 'appens\" and \"Guys and gals\" [8] Savile was frequently spoofed for his dress sense, which usually featured a tracksuit or shellsuit and gold jewellery A range of licensed fancy dress costumes was released with his consent in 2009 Savile was often pictured holding a cigar He claimed to have started smoking cigars at the age of seven, saying \"My dad gave me a drag on one at Christmas, thinking it would put me off them forever, but it had the opposite effect.\" [24]\n\n\nHealth and death\nOn 9 August 1997, Savile underwent a three-hour quadruple heart-bypass operation at Killingbeck Hospital in Killingbeck, Leeds, having known he needed the surgery for at least four years after attending regular check-ups [94] He arranged for a bench in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, to be dedicated to his memory, with a plaque saying \"Jimmy Savile – but not just yet!\" [95] [96]\n\n\nSexual abuse by Savile\nSavile often came into contact with his victims through his creative projects for the BBC and his charitable work for the NHS A significant part of his career and public life involved working with children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards He spent 20 years from 1964 presenting Top of the Pops, aimed at a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true [10]\n\n\nAllegations during his lifetime\nDuring his lifetime, two police investigations considered reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought related to sexual offences Sporadic allegations of child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but these only became widely publicised after his death [108] His autobiography As it Happens (1974; reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime [109]\n\n\nAfter his death\nImmediately after Savile's death, the BBC's Newsnight programme began an investigation into reports that he was a sexual abuser Meirion Jones and Liz MacKean interviewed one alleged victim on camera and others agreed to have their stories told The interviewees alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and the BBC Newsnight also discovered that Surrey Police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile [131] The item was scheduled for broadcast in Newsnight on 7 December 2011, but was withdrawn before broadcast; over Christmas 2011, the BBC broadcast two tributes to Savile.\n\n\nAftermath\nAn authorised biography, How's About That Then?, by Alison Bellamy, was published in June 2012 After the claims made against him were published, the author said that, in the light of the allegations, she felt \"let down and betrayed\" by Savile [153] Within a month of the child abuse scandal emerging, many places and organisations named after or connected to Savile were renamed or had his name removed [154] A memorial plaque on the wall of Savile's former home in Scarborough was removed in early October 2012 after it was defaced with graffiti [155] A wooden statue of Savile at Scotstoun Leisure Centre in Glasgow was also removed around the same time [156] Signs on a footpath in Scarborough named \"Savile's View\" were removed [157] [158] Savile's Hall, the conference centre at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds, was renamed New Dock Hall [159] The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust and the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust, two registered charities founded in his name to fight \"poverty and sickness and other charitable purposes\" announced they were too closely tied to his name to be sustainable and would close and distribute their funds to other charities, so as to avoid harm to beneficiaries from future media attention [73]\n\n\nDramatisation\nIn October 2020 the BBC announced a television mini-series with the working title The Reckoning, intended to recount Savile's rise to fame and the sexual abuse scandal that emerged after his death The drama was originally planned to appear in the BBC's autumn 2022 schedule, but after a delay for re-editing, it was broadcast in October 2023 A source said, \"The four-part drama is being edited in such a meticulous and careful way, so as not to create more pain and suffering for Savile's victims.\" [179] [180] [181] It was based in part on the book In Plain Sight: the Life and Lies of Jimmy Savile by Dan Davies [182] [183] [184]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nMany honours are considered to cease on the death of the holder;

mathematics teacher His mother was of Irish descent, while his father was Jewish [18] His paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants [19] During an interview for the Russian talk show Let Them Talk, Seagal stated that he has paternal ancestors from the Siberian city of Vladivostok, as well as Belarus and Saint Petersburg He said that genetic testing determined that he has Yakut and Buryat ancestry as well [20] When he was 5, Seagal moved with his parents to Fullerton, California His mother later told People magazine that prior to the move Seagal was frail and suffered from asthma: \"He was a puny kid back then But he really thrived after the move  [from Michigan].\" [21]\n\n\nMartial arts and Japan\nAccording to Seagal's first wife, Miyako Fujitani: \"I met Steven in California in the fall of 1974 He followed me back to Japan in October We got married in December 1974.\" [23] Fujitani was a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido After they married, they had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako Seagal taught at the school owned by Miyako's family and earned his aikido black belt in 1978 [21] Interviewed in 1993, Fujitani stated that: \"The only reason Steven was awarded the black belt was because the judge, who was famous for his laziness, fell asleep during Steven's presentation The judge just gave him the black belt.\" [23]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, Above the Law (titled Nico in Europe), with director Andrew Davis Seagal was asked to make the film by his former aikido pupil, agent Michael Ovitz, who believed that he could make anyone a movie star [29] The film grossed $18,869,631 in the U.S [30] and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated \"It contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers.\" [31] Following its success, Seagal's subsequent movies were Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, and Out for Justice; all were box office hits and made Seagal an action hero Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"Mr Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming.\" [32]\n\n\n1987–2002: Hollywood action star\nIn 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, Above the Law (titled Nico in

The New York Times wrote, \"Mr Seagal is effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming.\" [32]\n\n\n2003–present: Direct-to-video films and television\nOther than his role as a villain in Robert Rodriguez's Machete (2010), almost all the films Seagal has made since the latter half of 2001 have been released direct-to-video (DTV) in North America, with some theatrical releases to other countries around the world Seagal is credited as a producer and sometimes a writer on many of these DTV movies, which include Black Dawn, Belly of the Beast, Out of Reach, Submerged, Kill Switch, Urban Justice, Pistol Whipped, Against the Dark, Driven to Kill, A Dangerous Man, Born to Raise Hell, and The Keeper Beyond the Law (2019) is one of Seagal's few movies to have had a theatrical release in North America since Machete [50]\n\n\nArtistry\nMany of Seagal's films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work His characters often have an elite past affiliation with the CIA, Special Forces, or Black Ops (for example, Casey Ryback in Under Siege, a former Navy SEAL, Jack Cole in The Glimmer Man, an ex-CIA police detective, or Jonathan Cold in The Foreigner and Black Dawn, an ex-CIA Black Ops freelancer) His characters differ from those of other action movie icons by virtue of their near-invulnerability; they rarely face any significant physical threat, easily overpowering any opposition and seldom facing bodily harm or even temporary defeat [56] Two notable exceptions are Executive Decision (1996), in which Seagal's character is introduced as a false protagonist only to be killed halfway through [57] and Machete (2010), which features Seagal in a rare villainous role [58]\n\n\nOther ventures\nSeagal plays the guitar and among his extensive collection are guitars previously owned by \"the Kings\"; Albert, BB, and Freddie, as well as Bo Diddley, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Jimi Hendrix [64] In 2004, he released his first album, Songs from the Crystal Cave, which has a mix of pop, world, country, and blues music It features duets with Tony Rebel, Lt Stichie, Lady Saw, and Stevie Wonder The soundtrack to Seagal's 2005 film Into the Sun features several songs from the album One of his album tracks, \"Girl It's Alright\", was also released as a single in several countries alongside an accompanying music video Seagal's second album, titled Mojo Priest, was released in April 2006 and spawned a concert tour [65] Thom

musician. He is best known for his action films, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSteven Seagal was born on April 10, 1952, in Lansing, Michigan, to Patricia Anne Fisher and Samuel Seagal. His mother was of Irish descent, and his father was Jewish. Seagal's paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. In an interview, Seagal stated that he has paternal ancestors from the Siberian city of Vladivostok, as well as Belarus and Saint Petersburg. He also mentioned that genetic testing determined that he has Yakut and Buryat ancestry.\n\nWhen Seagal was five years old, his family moved to Fullerton, California. His mother later told People magazine that prior to the move, Seagal was a frail and asthma-prone child. However, he thrived after the move and began to develop an interest in martial arts.\n\n**Martial Arts and Japan**\n\nSeagal met his first wife, Miyako Fujitani, in California in 1974. Fujitani was a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. After they married in December 1974, Seagal and Fujitani had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. Seagal taught at the school owned by Miyako's family and earned his aikido black belt in 1978.\n\nHowever, in a 1993 interview, Fujitani stated that Seagal's black belt was awarded due to the laziness of the judge, who fell asleep during Seagal's presentation. The judge simply gave Seagal the black belt.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, Above the Law (titled Nico in Europe), with director Andrew Davis. Seagal was asked to make the film by his former aikido pupil, agent Michael Ovitz, who believed that he could make anyone a movie star. The film grossed $18,869,631 in the United States and received mixed reviews from critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that the film contained 50 percent more plot than it needed, but that allowed it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers.\n\nFollowing the success of Above the Law, Seagal's subsequent movies were Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, and Out for Justice; all were box office hits and made Seagal an action hero. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Seagal was effective for both his novelty value and his ability to be both literally and figuratively disarming.\n\n**1987–2002: Hollywood Action Star**\n\nIn 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, Above the Law (titled Nico in Europe), with director Andrew Davis.

Seagal is credited as a producer and sometimes a writer on many of these DTV movies, which include Black Dawn, Belly of the Beast, Out of Reach, Submerged, Kill Switch, Urban Justice, Pistol Whipped, Against the Dark, Driven to Kill, A Dangerous Man, Born to Raise Hell, and The Keeper Beyond the Law (2019).\n\n**Artistry**\n\nMany of Seagal's films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work. His characters often have an elite past affiliation with the CIA, Special Forces, or Black Ops. His characters differ from those of other action movie icons by virtue of their near-invulnerability; they rarely face any significant physical threat, easily overpowering any opposition and seldom facing bodily harm or even temporary defeat.\n\nTwo notable exceptions are Executive Decision (1996), in which Seagal's character is introduced as a false protagonist only to be killed halfway through, and Machete (2010), which features Seagal in a rare villainous role.\n\n**Other Ventures**\n\nSeagal plays the guitar and among his extensive collection are guitars previously owned by \"the Kings\"; Albert, BB, and Freddie, as well as Bo Diddley, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Jimi Hendrix. In 2004, he released his first album, Songs from the Crystal Cave, which has a mix of pop, world, country, and blues music. The soundtrack to Seagal's 2005 film Into the Sun features several songs from the album.\n\nSeagal's second album, titled Mojo Priest, was released in April 2006 and spawned a concert tour. However, the album received mixed reviews from critics, with Thom Jurek of AllMusic panning it and stating that Seagal's guitar playing rarely rises above bar band pedigree.\n\n**Law Enforcement Work**\n\nSeagal has been a Reserve Deputy Chief in the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Sheriff's Office.

of the weaknesses of the Paris bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics.And despite the existing infrastructure, if the process won, there was a guarantee that the French government and the French Football Federation would build a stadium for more than 80 thousand people and that it would become the main stage of the event.With the confirmation of France's choice announced on July 2, 1992,this new all-seater covered stadium was guaranteed and thus broke the country's tradition of not building any new specific structure for a sporting event,as the last one was the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir  Due to the magnitude and importance of the facility, the Council of State was allowed a first-hand approach to how the stadium would be constructed and paid for The Council sought for the stadium to be built as closest as possible to Paris and their metropolitan area, and that the constructor and operator of the facility would receive significant financial contributions for 30 months following the stadium's completion The architects Michel Macary, Aymeric Zublena, Michel Regembal, and Claude Constantini, who were associated with CR SCAU Architecture, handled the stadium's design  [citation

which straddle the communes of Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, and Saint-Ouen The primary goal was to renovate the area by building new residential and tertiary sites.\n\n\nRoof\nConstruction of the stadium's roof cost over €45 million Its elliptical shape symbolizes the universality of sport in France Its area of six hectares and weight, 13,000 tons, is considered a technical marvel by many It was designed to easily protect the 80,000 spectators without covering the playing field All lighting and sound, which include 550 lights and 36 blocks of 5 speakers, are housed inside to avoid obstructing visibility The tinted glass in the center reduces the contrast and distributes natural light It filters out red and infrared radiation, however, it allows blue and green lights, due to

{"title": "Video_hosting_service", "content": "\nDescription\nOnline video platforms can use a software as a service (SaaS) business model, a do it yourself (DIY) model or user-generated content (UGC) model The OVP comes with an end-to-end tool set to upload, encode, manage, playback, style, deliver, distribute, download, publish and measure quality of service or audience engagement quality of experience of online video content for both video on demand (VOD) and live delivery This is usually manifested as a User Interface with log-in credentials OVPs also include providing a custom video player or a third-party video player that can be embedded in a website Modern online video platforms are often coupled up with embedded online video analytics providing video publishers with detailed insights into video performance: the total number of video views, impressions, and unique views; video watch time, stats on user location, visits, and behavior on the site Video heat maps show how user engagement rate changes through the viewing process in order to measure audience interaction and to create compelling video content OVPs are related to the over-the-top content video industry, although there are many OVP providers that are also present in broadcast markets, serving video on demand set-top boxes.\n\n\nVideo and content delivery protocols\nThe vast majority of OVPs use industry-standard HTTP streaming or HTTP progressive download protocols With HTTP streaming, the de facto standard is to use adaptive streaming where multiple files of a video are created at different bit rates, but only one of these is sent to the end-user during playback, depending on available bandwidth or device CPU constraints This can be switched dynamically and near-seamlessly at any time during the video viewing The main protocols for adaptive HTTP streaming include Smooth Streaming (by Microsoft), HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) (by Apple) and Flash Video (by Adobe) Flash is still in use but is declining due to the popularity of HLS and Smooth Stream in mobile devices and desktops, respectively [citation needed] Each is a proprietary protocol in its own right and due to this fragmentation, there have been efforts to create one standardized protocol known as MPEG-DASH.\n\n\nInfluence\nIn the 2010s, with the increasing prevalence of technology and the Internet in everyday life, video hosting services serve as a portal to different forms of entertainment (comedy, shows, games, or music), news, documentaries and educational videos Content may be either both user-generated, amateur clips or commercial products The entertainment industry uses this medium to release music and videos, movies and television shows directly to the public Since many users do not have unlimited web space, either as a paid service, or through an ISP offering, video hosting services are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the explosion in popularity of blogs, internet forums and other interactive pages The mass market for camera phones and smartphones has increased the supply of user-generated video Traditional methods of personal video distribution, such as making a DVD to show to friends at home, are unsuited to the low resolution and high volume of camera phone clips In contrast, current broadband Internet connections are well suited to serving the quality of video shot on mobile phones Most people do not own web servers, and this has created demand for user-generated video content hosting [4] [5]\n\n\nCopyright issues\nOn some websites, users share entire films by breaking them up into segments that are about the size of the video length limit imposed by the site (e.g., 15-minutes) An emerging practice is for users to obfuscate the titles of feature-length films that they share by providing a title that is recognizable by humans but will not match on standard search engines It is not even in all cases obvious to the user if a provided video is a copyright infringement [citation needed]\n\n\nMobile video hosting\nA more recent application of the video hosting services is in the mobile web 2.0 arena, where video and other mobile content can be delivered to, and easily accessed by mobile devices While some video-hosting services like DaCast and Ustream have developed means by which video can be watched on mobile devices, mobile-oriented web-based frontends for video hosting services that possess equal access and capability to desktop-oriented web services have yet to be developed A mobile live streaming software called Qik allows the users to upload videos from their cell phones to the internet The videos will then be stored online and can be shared to various social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube Videos will be stored on the servers and can be watched from both the mobile devices and the website.\n\n\nHistory\nPractical online video hosting and video streaming was made possible by advances in video compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video Raw uncompressed digital video has a bit rate of 168 Mbit/s for SD video, and over 1 Gbit/s for full HD video [6] The most important data compression algorithm that enabled practical video hosting and streaming is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed, T Natarajan and K R Rao in 1973 [7] The DCT algorithm is the basis for the first practical video coding format, H.261, in 1988 [8] It was followed by more popular DCT-based video coding formats, most notably the MPEG and H.26x video standards from 1991 onwards [9] The modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) is also the basis for the MP3 audio compression format introduced in 1994, [10] and later the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format in 1999 [11]\n\n\nVideo hosting sites\nThe first Internet video hosting site was ShareYourWorld.com [12] Founded in 1997, it allowed users to upload clips or full videos in different file formats However, Internet access bandwidth and video transcoding technology at the time were limited, so the site did not support video streaming like YouTube later did ShareYourWorld was founded by Chase Norlin, and it ran until 2001, when it closed due to budget and bandwidth problems [citation needed]\n\n\nVideo streaming platforms\nYouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim and Steve Chen in 2005 It was based on video transcoding technology, which enabled the video streaming of user-generated content from anywhere on the World Wide Web This was made possible by implementing a Flash player based on MPEG-4 AVC video with AAC audio This allowed any video coding format to be uploaded, and then transcoded into Flash-compatible AVC video that can be directly streamed from anywhere on the Web The first YouTube video clip was Me at the zoo, uploaded by Karim in April 2005 [15]\n\n\nSee also\n\n", "lang":

The DCT algorithm is the basis for the first practical video coding format, H.261, in 1988. It was followed by more popular DCT-based video coding formats, most notably the MPEG and H.26x video standards from 1991 onwards.\n\nThe first Internet video hosting site was ShareYourWorld.com, founded in 1997. It allowed users to upload clips or full videos in different file formats. However, Internet access bandwidth and video transcoding technology at the time were limited, so the site did not support video streaming like YouTube later did. ShareYourWorld was founded by Chase Norlin, and it ran until 2001, when it closed due to budget and bandwidth problems.\n\n**Influence**\n\nIn the 2010s, with the increasing prevalence of technology and the Internet in everyday life, video hosting services serve as a portal to different forms of entertainment, news, documentaries, and educational videos. Content may be either user-generated, amateur clips or commercial products. The entertainment industry uses this medium to release music and videos, movies, and television shows directly to the public. Since many users do not have unlimited web space, either as a paid service or through an ISP offering, video hosting services are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the explosion in popularity of blogs, internet forums, and other interactive pages.\n\n**Video and Content Delivery Protocols**\n\nThe vast majority of OVPs use industry-standard HTTP streaming or HTTP progressive download protocols. With HTTP streaming, the de facto standard is to use adaptive streaming where multiple files of a video are created at different bit rates, but only one of these is sent to the end-user during playback, depending on available bandwidth or device CPU constraints. This can be switched dynamically and near-seamlessly at any time during the video viewing.\n\n**Copyright Issues**\n\nOn some websites, users share entire films by breaking them up into segments that are about the size of the video length limit imposed by the site (e.g., 15-minutes). An emerging practice is for users to obfuscate the titles of feature-length films that they share by providing a title that is recognizable by humans but will not match on standard search engines. It is not even in all cases obvious to the user if a provided video is a copyright infringement.\n\n**Mobile Video Hosting**\n\nA more recent application of the video hosting services is in the mobile web 2.0 arena, where video and other mobile content can be delivered to, and easily accessed by mobile devices. While some video-hosting services like DaCast and Ustream have developed means by which video can be watched on mobile devices, mobile-oriented web-based frontends for video hosting services that possess equal access and capability to desktop-oriented web services have yet to be developed.\n\n**Video Hosting Sites**\n\nYouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim, and Steve Chen in 2005. It was based on video transcoding technology, which enabled the video streaming of user-generated content from anywhere on the World Wide Web. This was made possible by implementing a Flash player based on MPEG-4 AVC video with AAC audio. The first YouTube video clip was \"Me at the zoo,\" uploaded by Karim in April 2005.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Online video platform\n* Video compression\n* Discrete cosine transform\n* H.261\n* MPEG\n*

\"Video_hosting_service\" following this outline:\n\n\nDescription\nOnline video platforms can use a software as a service (SaaS) business model, a do it yourself (DIY) model or user-generated content (UGC) model The OVP comes with an end-to-end tool set to upload, encode, manage, playback, style, deliver, distribute, download, publish and measure quality of service or audience engagement quality of experience of online video content for both video on demand (VOD) and live delivery This is usually manifested as a User Interface with log-in credentials OVPs also include providing a custom video player or a third-party video player that can be embedded in a website Modern online video platforms are often coupled up with embedded online video analytics providing video publishers with detailed insights into video performance: the total number of video views, impressions, and unique views; video watch time, stats on user location, visits, and behavior on the site Video heat maps show how user engagement rate changes through the viewing process in order to measure audience interaction and to create compelling video content OVPs are related to the over-the-top content video industry, although there are many OVP providers that are also present in broadcast markets, serving video on demand set-top boxes.\n\n\nVideo and content delivery protocols\nThe vast majority of OVPs use industry-standard HTTP streaming or HTTP progressive download protocols With HTTP streaming, the de facto standard is to use adaptive streaming where multiple files of a video are created at different bit rates, but only one of these is sent to the end-user during playback, depending on available bandwidth or device CPU constraints This can be switched dynamically and near-seamlessly at any time during the video viewing The main protocols for adaptive HTTP streaming include Smooth Streaming (by Microsoft), HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) (by Apple) and Flash Video (by Adobe) Flash is still in use but is declining due to the popularity of HLS and Smooth Stream in mobile devices and desktops, respectively [citation needed] Each is a proprietary protocol in its own right and due to this fragmentation, there have been efforts to create one standardized protocol known as MPEG-DASH.\n\n\nInfluence\nIn the 2010s, with the increasing prevalence of technology and the Internet in everyday life, video hosting services serve as a portal to different forms of entertainment (comedy, shows, games, or music), news, documentaries and educational videos Content may be either both user-generated, amateur clips or commercial products The entertainment industry uses this medium to release music and videos, movies and television shows directly to the public Since many users do not have unlimited web space, either as a paid service, or through an ISP offering, video hosting services are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the explosion in popularity of blogs, internet forums and other interactive pages The mass market for camera phones and smartphones has increased the supply of user-generated video Traditional methods of personal video distribution, such as making a DVD to show to friends at home, are unsuited to the low resolution and high volume of camera phone clips In contrast, current broadband Internet connections are well suited to serving the quality of video shot on mobile phones Most people do not own web servers, and this has created demand for user-generated video content hosting [4] [5]\n\n\nCopyright issues\nOn some websites, users share entire films by breaking them up into segments that are about the size of the video length limit imposed by the site (e.g., 15-minutes) An emerging practice is for users to obfuscate the titles of feature-length films that they share by providing a title that is recognizable by humans but will not match on standard search engines It is not even in all cases obvious to the user if a provided video is a copyright infringement [citation needed]\n\n\nMobile video hosting\nA more recent application of the video hosting services is in the mobile web 2.0 arena, where video and other mobile content can be delivered to, and easily accessed by mobile devices While some video-hosting services like DaCast and Ustream have developed means by which video can be watched on mobile devices, mobile-oriented web-based frontends for video hosting services that possess equal access and capability to desktop-oriented web services have yet to be developed A mobile live streaming software called Qik allows the users to upload videos from their cell phones to the internet The videos will then be stored online and can be shared to various social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube Videos will be stored on the servers and can be watched from both the mobile devices and the website.\n\n\nHistory\nPractical online video hosting and video streaming was made possible by advances in video compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video Raw uncompressed digital video has a bit rate of 168 Mbit/s for SD video, and over 1 Gbit/s for full HD video [6] The most important data compression algorithm that enabled practical video hosting and streaming is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed, T Natarajan and K R Rao in 1973 [7] The DCT algorithm is the basis for the first practical video coding format, H.261, in 1988 [8] It was followed by more popular DCT-based video coding formats, most notably the MPEG and H.26x video standards from 1991 onwards [9] The modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) is also the basis for the MP3 audio compression format introduced in 1994, [10] and later the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) format in 1999 [11]\n\n\nVideo hosting sites\nThe first Internet video hosting site was ShareYourWorld.com [12] Founded in 1997, it allowed users to upload clips or full videos in different file formats However, Internet access bandwidth and video transcoding technology at the time were limited, so the site did not support video streaming like YouTube later did ShareYourWorld was founded by Chase Norlin, and it ran until 2001, when it closed due to budget and bandwidth problems [citation needed]\n\n\nVideo streaming platforms\nYouTube was founded by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim and Steve Chen in 2005 It was based on video transcoding technology, which enabled the video streaming of user-generated content from anywhere on the World Wide Web This was made possible by implementing a Flash player based on MPEG-4 AVC video with AAC audio This allowed any video coding format to be uploaded, and then transcoded into Flash-compatible AVC video that can be directly streamed from anywhere on the Web The first YouTube video clip was Me at the zoo, uploaded by Karim in April 2005 [15]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Second_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump", "content": "\nBackground\nUnder the U.S Constitution, the House has the sole power of impeachment (Article I, Section 2, Clause 5), and after that action has been taken, the Senate has \"the sole Power to try all Impeachments\" (Article I, Section 3, Clause 6) Trump was the third U.S president to face a Senate impeachment trial, after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton [12] Trump is the only federal official to be impeached twice [13]\n\n\nHouse impeachment\nOn January 11, 2021, Representatives David Cicilline, Jamie Raskin, and Ted Lieu introduced an article of impeachment against Trump, charging him with \"incitement of insurrection\" in urging his supporters to march on the Capitol building The article stated that Trump had committed high crimes and misdemeanors by making several statements that \"encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – lawless action\" that interfered with Congress' constitutional duty to certify the election It said he had \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government\" in a way that rendered him \"a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution\" [16] [17] A total of 218 of the 222 House Democrats co-sponsored the article of impeachment, assuring its passage [18]\n\n\nTrial delay and planning\nIn the days following Trump's second impeachment, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) argued that, because the Senate was in pro forma sessions until January 19, it could not take on any business without the unanimous consent of its members According to Senate rules, once articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate, the Senate trial must begin the next day Had the article of impeachment been immediately transmitted to the Senate, Trump's trial thus would have begun on Inauguration Day, after Joe Biden was sworn in [21] [22]\n\n\nImpeachment trial of a former president\nA Congressional Research Service report concluded \"that while the matter is open to debate, the weight of scholarly authority agrees that former officials may be impeached and tried.\" [4] Ahead of the trial, 150 legal scholars from across the political spectrum published a letter affirming \"that the Constitution permits the impeachment, conviction, and disqualification of former officers, including presidents.\" [31] Law professors Laurence H Tribe and Stephen I Vladeck argued that because removal from office is only one of the two possible consequences of a conviction (the other being disqualification from holding public office), the purpose of the trial is not nullified if the impeached person no longer holds public office [32] [33] Gregg Nunziata, a former Republican lawyer for the Senate Judiciary Committee, similarly noted that because impeachment power includes the power to disqualify the person from federal office for life, allowing officeholders to evade this by resigning would render \"this important punishment .. a nullity.\" [34] Leading conservative lawyer Charles J Cooper agreed, writing in the Wall Street Journal the weekend before the trial that there is no Constitutional prohibition against a post-presidency trial [35] [36] Cardozo School of Law constitutional law professor Kate Shaw argued that \"drafting history, impeachment practice, and basic constitutional design all point clearly in favor of the constitutionality of trying an ex-president.\" [34] Legal scholar Brian C Kalt, who has published research about late impeachments, stated, \"In multiple cases, the House and Senate have proceeded as though they can impeach and try people who have already left office, and in one case the Senate took a specific vote to that effect.\" [34]\n\n\nOfficers of the trial\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, that Chief Justice John Roberts had declined to preside over the trial because he believed that the chief justice only presided when the current president was tried [42] [43]\nPatrick Leahy, president pro tempore of the Senate, presided over the trial, [44] [45] in place of Vice President Kamala Harris, the ex officio president of the Senate, who might have involved herself if any tie-breaking votes were needed [46]\n\n\nPresiding officer\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, that Chief Justice John Roberts had declined to preside over the trial because he believed that the chief justice only presided when the current president was tried [42] [43]\nPatrick Leahy, president pro tempore of the Senate, presided over the trial, [44] [45] in place of Vice President Kamala Harris, the ex officio president of the Senate, who might have involved herself if any tie-breaking votes were needed [46]\n\n\nHouse managers\nOn January 12, the day before the House debated the article of impeachment, Pelosi named nine Democratic representatives to be managers in the Senate trial: Raskin (lead manager), Cicilline, Lieu, Diana DeGette, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Joe Neguse, Madeleine Dean, and Stacey Plaskett [50] The managers were chosen for their expertise in constitutional law, civil rights, and criminal justice Raskin is a former constitutional law professor at American University; Lieu is a former military prosecutor in the United States Air Force; Cicilline is a former public defender; Swalwell is a former prosecutor in California; DeGette is a former civil rights attorney; and Castro, Neguse, Dean, and Plaskett are all former lawyers in private practice [51]\n\n\nTrump counsel\nIt was initially unclear who would be on Trump's legal team, as numerous prominent law firms had refused to represent him The Lincoln Project had publicly pressed law firms not to do so [41] Law & Crime reported that \"essentially all respectable law firms and attorneys\" were distancing themselves from him [53]\n\n\nSenators' positions\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said: \"The evidence is Trump's own words, recorded on video It's a question of whether Republicans want to step up and face history.\" [76] Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said, \"This is a very simple allegation It is incitement to insurrection We could conduct a trial in a concise amount of time because the evidence that's needed is pretty direct.\" [77] In the run-up to the trial, a number of Republican senators opposed holding a trial [78] [79] Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky continued to make false claims of election fraud [80] [81] Other Senate Republicans, such as Marco Rubio of Florida, contended that a Senate trial would be too divisive and that it would be \"arrogant\" for the Senate to exercise its power to bar Trump from holding office in the future [82] [83]\n\n\nOn whether to hold a trial\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said: \"The evidence is Trump's own words, recorded on video It's a question of whether Republicans want to step up and face history.\" [76] Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said, \"This is a very simple allegation It is incitement to insurrection We could conduct a trial in a concise amount of time because the evidence that's needed is pretty direct.\" [77] In the run-up to the trial, a number of Republican senators opposed holding a trial [78] [79] Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky continued to make false claims of election fraud [80] [81] Other Senate Republicans, such as Marco Rubio of Florida, contended that a Senate trial would be too divisive and that it would be \"arrogant\" for the Senate to exercise its power to bar Trump from holding office in the future [82] [83]\n\n\nOn whether to vote to convict\nSenate Democrats favored the conviction of Trump, stating that the evidence was clear and straightforward Assuming all Democratic senators (and the two independent senators caucusing with the Democrats) had voted to convict Trump, 17 Republican senators would have needed to vote to secure the two-thirds majority for conviction If Trump had been convicted, then the Senate could have disqualified him from holding any federal office by a simple majority vote [77] [76] On February 9, 45 senators (38 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 2 independents caucusing with the Democrats) supported conviction, 35 senators (all Republican) opposed conviction, and 20 senators (10 Democrats and 10 Republicans) had not released an official statement This implied that to convict Trump with the required two-thirds majority, some of the Republican senators who said they opposed conviction would have needed to change their minds, either by voting to convict or by not appearing for the vote [75] Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) worked to persuade other Republicans to vote against conviction [76] In January, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, the former Senate Majority Leader, reportedly told senators their decision on whether to convict the outgoing president would be a \"vote of conscience\" [84] and told colleagues he was undecided whether he himself would vote to convict [85] He later stated on the Senate floor that President Trump \"provoked\" the mob that stormed the Capitol [86] However, McConnell announced on the morning of February 13 that he would vote to acquit Trump [87] [88]\n\n\nPre-trial\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the U.S Constitution states that \"The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\" Per the Senate's impeachment rules adopted in 1986, the submission of the articles to the Senate initiated the trial [14] Speaker Pelosi signed the article of impeachment on January 13, 2021 [89] The article was formally transmitted to the Senate on January 25, 2021 [90] On January 26, the House impeachment managers, accompanied by the clerk of the House and the acting House sergeant at arms, conducted the ceremonial procession from the House to the Senate (across the National Statuary Hall and the Capitol rotunda) to formally deliver the article of impeachment, triggering the trial [91] [92] Raskin, the lead House impeachment manager, read the article to the Senate [91]\n\n\nOpening ceremonies\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the U.S Constitution states that \"The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\" Per the Senate's impeachment

procession from the House to the Senate (across the National Statuary Hall and the Capitol rotunda) to formally deliver the article of impeachment, triggering the trial [91] [92] Raskin, the lead House impeachment manager, read the article to the Senate [91]\n\n\nRand Paul's point of order to dismiss\nOn January 26, Republican Senator Rand Paul forced a vote to dismiss the impeachment charge, on the basis that it was unconstitutional to try a past president The motion was defeated 55–45, with all Democrats, both the independents, and five Republicans (Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania) voting against the motion [3] [4] The vote was seen as a \"test vote\" and was viewed as a strong indication that the Senate would not reach the two-thirds majority required to convict Trump [4] [95]\n\n\nTrial memoranda and responses\nUnder an agreement between Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the pre-trial briefing schedule was set [93]\n\n\nHouse's brief, Trump's answer, House's replication\nThe House of Representatives, through the nine Democratic impeachment managers, filed an 80-page pretrial brief on February 2 The detailed brief stated that Trump was \"singularly responsible\" for the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, citing his preceding campaign to undermine democracy and overthrow the election, and argued that acquitting Trump and failing to disqualify him from future office would gravely harm the nation, stating: \"President Trump has demonstrated beyond doubt that he will resort to any method to maintain or reassert his grip on power A president who violently attacks the democratic process has no right to participate in it.\" [98]\n\n\nTrump's brief, House's reply\nTrump, through his attorneys Bruce L Castor Jr., David Schoen, and Michael T van der Veen, [107] [108] submitted a brief asserting that Democratic leadership in the House were engaging in a \"selfish attempt\" to capitalize on the storming of the Capitol and its aftermath They argued that instead of healing the nation or prosecuting lawmakers who participated in the riot, they instead intend \"to callously harness the chaos of the moment for their own political gain.\" [108] Unusual for legal documents, Trump's lawyers invoked partisan rhetoric, writing that Democrats suffer from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\"; sought to \"silence a political opponent and a minority party\" as part of a years-long effort; and \"hunger for this political theater\" that would be \"a danger to our Republic  [sic] democracy and the rights that we hold dear.\" [109]\n\n\nTrump declines invitation to testify\nIn a letter to Trump attorneys on February 4, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin invited Trump to testify (and be subject to cross-examination) before or during the impeachment trial; the House impeachment managers argued that his testimony was needed after he disputed the House's allegations that he incited the insurrection at the Capitol [117] The letter stated that Trump's refusal to testify would support \"a strong adverse inference\" against Trump [117] The House's letter noted that there was no barrier to a former president giving testimony (and noted that Presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton had testified in office, and the Supreme Court held in Trump v Vance (2020) that Trump was not immune from legal process while serving as president) [118]\n\n\nArgument preparation\nIn preparation for the trial, House Democrats built a detailed case against Trump, emphasizing what Trump knew in advance of the attack on the Capitol on January 6 and the effect of Trump's words and actions on his rioting supporters, with the goal of showing that Trump \"summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack\" [123] In a notable departure on strategy, the managers declined to discuss the logistics of their case, whereas in the previous impeachment trial they had engaged in numerous communication platforms to advance their position to the public The managers also sought to apply the lessons learned in the last impeachment trial: not antagonize Republicans, use lots of videos, and make succinct arguments [52] [124] The managers prepared to conclude in a week, forgoing witnesses as they believed it would be unnecessary and hinder Biden's priorities on passing legislation and confirming nominees [125] The managers intended to use the evidence collected in FBI affidavits charging hundreds of the Capitol insurrectionists, many of whom cited Trump's comments as permission to storm the Capitol On certain filings, Trump is described as a \"de facto unindicted coconspirator\" for the Capitol riots and the driving force behind the breach, according to Proud Boys organizer Ethan Nordean [109] Accordingly, the House was reported to present their case like a \"violent crime criminal prosecution.\" [126] House impeachment managers and the staff, aided by the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, compiled audio and video footage of Trump's rally and the ensuing attack on the Capitol, as well as details about the injuries sustained by police [123] [127] [128]\n\n\nProsecution\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability [155]\n\n\nDefense\nOn February 12, Trump's counsel Castor, Schoen, van der Veen and Brennan presented their opening arguments [132] Van der Veen called the impeachment article an \"unconstitutional act of political vengeance\" and amounted to \"constitutional cancel culture\" on Trump and his supporters They claimed that Trump's remarks that day \"encouraged those in attendance to exercise their rights peacefully and patriotically\", [163] [164] [165] and that the House's charge that he incited an insurrection was \"a preposterous and monstrous lie\" [166]\n\n\nProcedural resolution\nOn February 8, Schumer and McConnell reached an agreement on the procedural resolution for the trial, giving the impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers up to 16 hours each to present their cases and creating the option for a debate and vote to call witnesses if the House impeachment managers sought it Schumer announced that the trial rules had been agreed to by Senate Republican and Democrats, as well as the House managers and Trump's legal team [134] Trump's attorney David Schoen, who is of Jewish faith, originally requested a pause of the trial for the Sabbath, starting on the evening of Friday, February 12, and for the trial to resume on Sunday, February 14 [134] [135] Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Senate leadership agreed to this request, but Schoen later withdrew this request, saying that other Trump defense lawyers could continue the trial during this period [136]\n\n\nConstitutionality of the trial and debate\nIn a two-hour presentation on February 9, the House managers argued that the Senate has jurisdiction to try the impeachment of Trump [98] Castor opened the defense argument with what many criticized as a rambling 48-minute presentation [138] [139] [140] He argued that the impeachment was politically motivated, and unnecessary because voters had already been \"smart enough\" to vote Trump out of office and, in doing so, explicitly acknowledged Biden had won a free and fair election [141] [142] [143]  Raskin played video footage of the Capitol storming and Trump's rhetoric to highlight the consequences if presidents could commit impeachable offenses in their last month without constitutional accountability [126]\n\n\nOpening arguments and presentations\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability [155]\n\n\nProsecution\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability [155]\n\n\nMike Lee's motion to strike\nImmediately after the end of the first day of opening arguments, Senator Mike Lee raised an objection [160] He moved to strike a portion of the prosecution's presentation in which they described Trump's telephone calls to him and Senator Tommy Tuberville, claiming that their description of the calls was untrue This drew much confusion due to Lee's spokesperson and Tuberville confirming the calls from Trump Despite the perplexity of the situation, Rep Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, eventually agreed to Lee's request calling it \"much to do about nothing\" [160] [161] [162]\n\n\nDefense\nOn February 12, Trump's counsel Castor, Schoen, van der Veen and Brennan presented their opening arguments [132] Van der Veen called the impeachment article an \"unconstitutional act of political vengeance\" and amounted to \"constitutional cancel culture\" on Trump and his supporters They claimed that Trump's remarks that day \"encouraged those in attendance to exercise their rights peacefully and patriotically\", [163] [164] [165] and that the House's charge that he incited an insurrection was \"a preposterous and monstrous lie\" [166]\n\n\nReactions and developments\nRepublicans generally lauded the House managers' presentation, with focus being drawn to Ted Lieu's warning that he was not concerned about the results of Trump winning another presidential election, but of his losing one [179] Most Republicans said they thought Trump would be acquitted, with some repeating their convictions about the trial's alleged unconstitutionality [179] Trump's lawyers' presentation was praised by Republicans such as Ron Johnson [180] and John Barrasso [181]\n\n\nQuestion-and-answer session\nOn the fourth day of the hearing, senators had four hours to submit questions to the House managers and the counsel for Donald Trump [183]\n\n\nVote on subpoenas\nOn February 13, 2021, the Senate voted 55–45 to allow both sides to subpoena witnesses for testimony and documents for the trial The vote came as a surprise to both sides, as the expectation had been that a vote would be taken and the trial would end on that day The trial was recessed so that the parties could discuss what steps to take An additional vote would be required to establish the rules for calling witnesses [186]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nThe impeachment managers made their closing arguments on February 13 Raskin argued that Trump's \"dereliction of duty .. was central to his incitement of insurrection, and inextricable from it,\" and that Trump's call with McCarthy confirmed he did not care for the safety of lawmakers [195] Dean played a video montage of Trump's repeating the 'big lie' Mike Lee briefly interrupted their arguments to object to using the video, as new evidence is not allowed to be admitted during closing arguments, but Dean argued that statement was already on record, and so Dean was allowed to continue and use it [196] [197] [198] Neguse concluded with an emotional appeal to senators and alluded to Martin Luther King Jr, warning of a \"dark future\" if senators did not convict Trump [199] Neguse rebutted the defense's arguments of lack of due process by arguing that the defense fully presented their evidence and declined invitations to testify and provide exculpatory evidence, and the defense's video montage of Democrats using words like \"fight\" by stating they did not end in attempting to overturn an election in the Capitol [200]\n\n\nVerdict\nTrump was acquitted by the Senate on February 13, 2021, with 57 senators voting in favor of conviction and 43 voting against Seven Republican senators joined the entire Democratic caucus in voting for conviction: Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill

States Senate in February 2021, following Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2021. Trump was the third U.S. president to face a Senate impeachment trial, after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Trump is the only federal official to be impeached twice.\n\n## House Impeachment\n\nOn January 11, 2021, Representatives David Cicilline, Jamie Raskin, and Ted Lieu introduced an article of impeachment against Trump, charging him with \"incitement of insurrection\" in urging his supporters to march on the Capitol building. The article stated that Trump had committed high crimes and misdemeanors by making several statements that \"encouraged – and foreseeably resulted in – lawless action\" that interfered with Congress' constitutional duty to certify the election. A total of 218 of the 222 House Democrats co-sponsored the article of impeachment, assuring its passage.\n\n## Trial Delay and Planning\n\nIn the days following Trump's second impeachment, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued that, because the Senate was in pro forma sessions until January 19, it could not take on any business without the unanimous consent of its members. According to Senate rules, once articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate, the Senate trial must begin the next day. Had the article of impeachment been immediately transmitted to the Senate, Trump's trial would have begun on Inauguration Day, after Joe Biden was sworn in.\n\n## Impeachment Trial of a Former President\n\nA Congressional Research Service report concluded that while the matter is open to debate, the weight of scholarly authority agrees that former officials may be impeached and tried. Ahead of the trial, 150 legal scholars from across the political spectrum published a letter affirming that the Constitution permits the impeachment, conviction, and disqualification of former officers, including presidents. Law professors Laurence H. Tribe and Stephen I. Vladeck argued that because removal from office is only one of the two possible consequences of a conviction (the other being disqualification from holding public office), the purpose of the trial is not nullified if the impeached person no longer holds public office.\n\n## Officers of the Trial\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that Chief Justice John Roberts had declined to preside over the trial because he believed that the chief justice only presides when the current president is tried. Patrick Leahy, president pro tempore of the Senate, presided over the trial, in place of Vice President Kamala Harris, who might have involved herself if any tie-breaking votes were needed.\n\n## House Managers\n\nOn January 12, the day before the House debated the article of impeachment, Pelosi named nine Democratic representatives to be managers in the Senate trial: Raskin (lead manager), Cicilline, Lieu, Diana DeGette, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Joe Neguse, Madeleine Dean, and Stacey Plaskett. The managers were chosen for their expertise in constitutional law, civil rights, and criminal justice.\n\n## Trump Counsel\n\nIt was initially unclear who would be on Trump's legal team, as numerous prominent law firms had refused to represent him. Law & Crime reported that \"essentially all respectable law firms and attorneys\" were distancing themselves from him.\n\n## Senators' Positions\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, \"The evidence is Trump's own words, recorded on video. It's a question of whether Republicans want to step up and face history.\" Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said, \"This is a very simple allegation. It is incitement to insurrection. We could conduct a trial in a concise amount of time because the evidence that's needed is pretty direct.\" In the run-up to the trial, a number of Republican senators opposed holding a trial.\n\n## Pre-Trial\n\nOn February 2, the House of Representatives, through the nine Democratic impeachment managers, filed an 80-page pretrial brief. The brief stated that Trump was \"singularly responsible\" for the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, citing his preceding campaign to undermine democracy and overthrow the election.\n\n## Prosecution\n\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram. Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability.\n\n## Defense\n\nOn February 12, Trump's counsel Castor, Schoen, van der Veen, and Brennan presented their opening arguments. Van der Veen called the impeachment article an \"unconstitutional act of political vengeance\" and amounted to \"constitutional cancel culture\" on Trump and his supporters.\n\n## Procedural Resolution\n\nOn February 8, Schumer and McConnell reached an agreement on the procedural resolution for the trial, giving the impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers up to 16 hours each to present their cases and creating the option for a debate and vote to call witnesses if the House impeachment managers sought it.\n\n## Constitutionality of the Trial and Debate\n\nIn a two-hour presentation on February 9, the House managers argued that the Senate has jurisdiction to try the impeachment of Trump. Castor opened the defense argument with a rambling 48-minute presentation, arguing that the impeachment was politically motivated and unnecessary because voters had already been \"smart enough\" to vote Trump out of office.\n\n## Opening Arguments and Presentations\n\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram. Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability.\n\n## Mike Lee's Motion to Strike\n\nImmediately after the end of the first day of opening arguments, Senator Mike Lee raised an objection. He moved to strike a portion of the prosecution's presentation in which they described Trump's telephone calls to him and Senator Tommy Tuberville, claiming that their description of the calls was untrue.\n\n## Reactions and Developments\n\nRepublicans generally lauded the House managers' presentation, with focus being drawn to Ted Lieu's warning that he was not concerned about the results of Trump winning another presidential election, but of his losing one. Most Republicans said they thought Trump would be acquitted, with some repeating their convictions about the trial's alleged unconstitutionality.\n\n## Question-and-Answer Session\n\nOn the fourth day of the hearing, senators had four hours to submit questions to the House managers and the counsel for Donald Trump.\n\n## Vote on Subpoenas\n\nOn February 13, 2021, the Senate voted 55–45 to allow both sides to subpoena witnesses for testimony and documents for the trial.\n\n## Closing Arguments\n\nThe impeachment managers made their closing arguments on February 13. Raskin argued that Trump's \"dereliction of duty .. was central to his incitement of insurrection, and inextricable from it,\" and that Trump's call with McCarthy confirmed he did not care for the safety of lawmakers.\n\n## Verdict\n\nTrump was acquitted by the Senate on February 13, 2021, with 57 senators voting in favor of conviction and 43 voting against. Seven Republican senators joined the entire Democratic caucus in voting for conviction.\n\n## Reactions\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor after the adjournment of the \"Court of Impeachment,\" Minority and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for acquittal, said his vote was based on his belief that the Constitution did not permit the Senate to convict an ex-president. He noted that Trump \"didn't get away with anything yet\" because the criminal justice system could still deal with the situation.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nAfter being acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial, Trump has continued to face legal troubles, including the threat of criminal action or civil litigation.

Vladeck argued that because removal from office is only one of the two possible consequences of a conviction (the other being disqualification from holding public office), the purpose of the trial is not nullified if the impeached person no longer holds public office [32] [33] Gregg Nunziata, a former Republican lawyer for the Senate Judiciary Committee, similarly noted that because impeachment power includes the power to disqualify the person from federal office for life, allowing officeholders to evade this by resigning would render \"this important punishment .. a nullity.\" [34] Leading conservative lawyer Charles J Cooper agreed, writing in the Wall Street Journal the weekend before the trial that there is no Constitutional prohibition against a post-presidency trial [35] [36] Cardozo School of Law constitutional law professor Kate Shaw argued that \"drafting history, impeachment practice, and basic constitutional design all point clearly in favor of the constitutionality of trying an ex-president.\" [34] Legal scholar Brian C Kalt, who has published research about late impeachments, stated, \"In multiple cases, the House and Senate have proceeded as though they can impeach and try people who have already left office, and in one case the Senate took a specific vote to that effect.\" [34]\n\n\nOfficers of the trial\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an

rights, and criminal justice Raskin is a former constitutional law professor at American University; Lieu is a former military prosecutor in the United States Air Force; Cicilline is a former public defender; Swalwell is a former prosecutor in California; DeGette is a former civil rights attorney; and Castro, Neguse, Dean, and Plaskett are all former lawyers in private practice [51]\n\n\nTrump counsel\nIt was initially unclear who would be on Trump's legal team, as numerous prominent law firms had refused to represent him The Lincoln Project had publicly pressed law firms not to do so [41] Law & Crime reported that \"essentially all respectable law firms and attorneys\" were distancing themselves from him [53]\n\n\nSenators' positions\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said: \"The evidence is Trump's own words, recorded on video It's a question of whether Republicans want to step up and face history.\" [76] Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said, \"This is a very simple

Republican senators opposed holding a trial [78] [79] Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky continued to make false claims of election fraud [80] [81] Other Senate Republicans, such as Marco Rubio of Florida, contended that a Senate trial would be too divisive and that it would be \"arrogant\" for the Senate to exercise its power to bar Trump from holding office in the future [82] [83]\n\n\nOn whether to hold a trial\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said: \"The evidence is Trump's own words, recorded on video It's a question of whether Republicans want to step up and face history.\" [76]

bar Trump from holding office in the future [82] [83]\n\n\nOn whether to vote to convict\nSenate Democrats favored the conviction of Trump, stating that the evidence was clear and straightforward Assuming all Democratic senators (and the two independent senators caucusing with the Democrats) had voted to convict Trump, 17 Republican senators would have needed to vote to secure the two-thirds majority for conviction If Trump had been convicted, then the Senate could have disqualified him from holding any federal office by a simple majority vote [77] [76] On February 9, 45 senators (38 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 2 independents caucusing with the Democrats) supported conviction, 35 senators (all Republican) opposed conviction, and 20 senators (10 Democrats and 10 Republicans) had not released an official statement This implied that to convict Trump with the required two-thirds majority, some of the Republican senators who said they opposed conviction would have needed to change their minds, either by voting to convict or by not appearing for the vote [75] Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) worked to persuade other Republicans to vote against conviction [76] In January, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, the former Senate Majority Leader, reportedly told senators their decision on whether to convict the outgoing president would be a \"vote of conscience\" [84] and told colleagues he was undecided whether he himself would vote to convict [85] He later stated on the Senate floor that President Trump \"provoked\" the mob that stormed the Capitol [86] However, McConnell announced on the morning of February 13 that he would vote to acquit Trump [87] [88]\n\n\nPre-trial\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the U.S Constitution states that \"The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\" Per the Senate's impeachment rules adopted in 1986, the submission of the articles to the Senate initiated the trial [14] Speaker Pelosi signed the article of impeachment on January 13, 2021 [89] The article was formally transmitted to the Senate on January 25, 2021 [90] On January 26, the House impeachment managers, accompanied by the clerk of the House and the acting House sergeant at arms, conducted the ceremonial procession from the House to the Senate (across the National Statuary Hall and the Capitol rotunda) to formally deliver the article of impeachment, triggering the trial [91] [92] Raskin, the lead House impeachment manager, read the article to the Senate [91]\n\n\nOpening ceremonies\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the

point of order to dismiss\nOn January 26, Republican Senator Rand Paul forced a vote to dismiss the impeachment charge, on the basis that it was unconstitutional to try a past president The motion was defeated 55–45, with all Democrats, both the independents, and five Republicans (Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania) voting against the motion [3] [4] The vote was seen as a \"test vote\" and was viewed as a strong indication that the Senate would not reach the two-thirds majority required to convict Trump [4] [95]\n\n\nTrial memoranda and responses\nUnder an agreement between Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, the pre-trial briefing schedule was set [93]\n\n\nHouse's brief, Trump's answer, House's replication\nThe House of Representatives, through the nine Democratic impeachment managers, filed an 80-page pretrial brief on February 2 The detailed brief stated that Trump was \"singularly responsible\" for the violent attack on the Capitol on January 6, citing his preceding campaign to undermine democracy and overthrow the election, and argued that acquitting Trump and failing to disqualify him from future office would gravely harm the nation, stating: \"President Trump has demonstrated beyond doubt that he will resort to any method to maintain or reassert his grip on power A president who violently attacks the democratic process has no right to participate in it.\" [98]\n\n\nTrump's brief, House's reply\nTrump, through his attorneys Bruce L Castor Jr., David Schoen, and Michael T van der Veen, [107] [108] submitted a brief asserting that Democratic leadership in the House were engaging in a \"selfish attempt\" to capitalize on the storming of the Capitol and its aftermath They argued that instead of healing the nation or prosecuting lawmakers who participated in the riot, they instead intend \"to callously harness the chaos of the moment for their own political gain.\" [108] Unusual for legal documents, Trump's lawyers invoked partisan rhetoric, writing that Democrats suffer from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\"; sought to \"silence a political opponent and a minority party\" as part of a years-long effort; and \"hunger for this political theater\" that would be \"a danger to our Republic  [sic] democracy and the rights that we hold dear.\" [109]\n\n\nTrump declines invitation to testify\nIn a letter to Trump attorneys on February 4, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin invited Trump to testify (and be subject to cross-examination) before or during the impeachment trial; the House impeachment managers argued that his testimony was needed after he disputed the House's allegations that he incited the insurrection at the Capitol [117] The letter stated that Trump's refusal to testify would support \"a strong adverse inference\" against Trump [117] The House's letter noted that there was no barrier to a former president giving testimony (and noted that Presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton had testified in office, and the Supreme Court held in Trump v Vance (2020) that Trump was not immune from legal process while serving as president) [118]\n\n\nArgument preparation\nIn preparation for the trial, House Democrats built a detailed case against Trump, emphasizing what Trump knew in advance of the attack on the Capitol on January 6 and the effect of Trump's words and actions on his rioting supporters, with the goal of showing that Trump \"summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack\" [123] In a notable departure on strategy, the managers declined to discuss the logistics of their case, whereas in the previous impeachment trial they had engaged in numerous communication platforms to advance their position to the public The managers also sought to apply the lessons learned in the last impeachment trial: not antagonize Republicans, use lots of videos, and make succinct arguments [52] [124] The managers prepared to conclude in a week, forgoing witnesses as they believed it would be unnecessary and hinder Biden's priorities on passing legislation and confirming nominees [125] The managers intended to use the evidence collected in FBI affidavits charging hundreds of the Capitol insurrectionists, many of whom cited Trump's comments as permission to storm the Capitol On certain filings, Trump is described as a \"de facto unindicted coconspirator\" for the Capitol riots and the driving force behind the breach, according to Proud Boys organizer Ethan Nordean [109] Accordingly, the House was reported to present their case like a \"violent crime criminal prosecution.\" [126] House impeachment managers and the staff, aided by the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, compiled audio and video footage of Trump's rally and the ensuing attack on the Capitol, as well as details about the injuries sustained by police [123] [127] [128]\n\n\nProsecution\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability [155]\n\n\nDefense\nOn February 12, Trump's counsel Castor, Schoen, van der Veen and Brennan presented their opening arguments [132] Van der Veen called the impeachment article an \"unconstitutional act of political vengeance\" and amounted to \"constitutional cancel culture\" on Trump and his supporters They claimed that Trump's remarks that day \"encouraged those in attendance to exercise their rights peacefully and patriotically\", [163] [164] [165] and that the House's charge that he incited an insurrection was \"a preposterous and monstrous lie\" [166]\n\n\nProcedural resolution\nOn February 8, Schumer and McConnell reached an agreement on the procedural resolution for the trial, giving the impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers up to 16 hours each to present their cases and creating the option for a debate and vote to call witnesses if the House impeachment managers sought it Schumer announced that the trial rules had been agreed to by Senate Republican and Democrats, as well as the House managers and Trump's legal team [134] Trump's attorney David Schoen, who is of Jewish faith, originally requested a pause of the trial for the Sabbath, starting on the evening of Friday, February 12, and for the trial to resume on Sunday, February 14 [134] [135] Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Senate leadership agreed to this request, but Schoen later withdrew this request, saying that other Trump defense lawyers could continue the trial during this period [136]\n\n\nConstitutionality of the trial and debate\nIn a two-hour presentation on February 9, the House managers argued that the Senate has jurisdiction to try the impeachment of Trump [98] Castor opened the defense argument with what many criticized as a rambling 48-minute presentation [138] [139] [140] He argued that the impeachment was politically motivated, and unnecessary because voters had already been \"smart enough\" to vote Trump out of office and, in doing so, explicitly acknowledged Biden had won a free and fair election [141] [142] [143]  Raskin played video footage of the Capitol storming and Trump's rhetoric to highlight the consequences if presidents could commit impeachable offenses in their last month without constitutional accountability [126]\n\n\nOpening arguments and presentations\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with people phoning their loved ones to say goodbye, and \"the most haunting sound I ever heard\" – people pounding on the door like a battering ram Regarding the constitutionality of trying Trump when he was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability [155]\n\n\nProsecution\nOn February 9, Raskin described the scene in the House during the invasion, with

was no longer in office, he urged senators not to create a \"January exception\" to a president's accountability [155]\n\n\nMike Lee's motion to strike\nImmediately after the end of the first day of opening arguments, Senator Mike Lee raised an objection [160] He moved to strike a portion of the prosecution's presentation in which they described Trump's telephone calls to him and Senator Tommy Tuberville, claiming that their description of the calls was untrue This drew much confusion due to Lee's spokesperson and Tuberville confirming the calls from Trump Despite the perplexity of the situation, Rep Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, eventually agreed to Lee's request calling it \"much to do about nothing\" [160] [161] [162]\n\n\nDefense\nOn February 12, Trump's counsel Castor, Schoen, van der Veen and Brennan presented their opening arguments [132] Van der Veen called the impeachment article an \"unconstitutional act of political vengeance\" and amounted to \"constitutional cancel culture\" on Trump and his supporters They claimed that Trump's remarks that day \"encouraged those in attendance to exercise their rights peacefully and patriotically\", [163] [164] [165] and that the House's charge that he incited an insurrection was \"a preposterous and monstrous lie\" [166]\n\n\nReactions and developments\nRepublicans generally lauded the House managers' presentation, with focus being drawn to Ted Lieu's warning that he was not concerned about the results of Trump winning another presidential election, but of his losing one [179] Most Republicans said they thought Trump would be acquitted, with some repeating their convictions about the trial's alleged unconstitutionality [179] Trump's lawyers' presentation was praised by Republicans such as Ron Johnson [180] and John Barrasso [181]\n\n\nQuestion-and-answer session\nOn the fourth day of the hearing, senators had four hours to submit questions to the House managers and the counsel for Donald Trump [183]\n\n\nVote on subpoenas\nOn February 13, 2021, the Senate voted 55–45 to allow both sides to subpoena witnesses for testimony and documents for the trial The vote came as a surprise to both sides, as the expectation had been that a vote would be taken and the trial would end on that day The trial was recessed so that the parties could discuss what steps to take An additional vote would be required to establish the rules for calling witnesses [186]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nThe impeachment managers made their closing arguments on February 13 Raskin argued that Trump's \"dereliction of duty .. was central to his incitement of insurrection, and inextricable from it,\" and that Trump's call with McCarthy confirmed he did not care for the safety of lawmakers [195] Dean played a video montage of Trump's repeating the 'big lie' Mike Lee briefly interrupted their arguments to object to using the video, as new evidence is not allowed to be admitted during closing arguments, but Dean argued that statement was already on record, and so Dean was allowed to continue and use it [196] [197] [198] Neguse concluded with an emotional appeal to senators and alluded to Martin Luther King Jr, warning of a \"dark future\" if senators did not convict Trump [199] Neguse rebutted the defense's arguments of lack of due process by arguing that the defense fully presented their evidence and declined invitations to testify and provide exculpatory evidence, and the defense's video montage of Democrats using words like \"fight\" by stating they did not end in attempting to overturn an election in the Capitol [200]\n\n\nVerdict\nTrump was acquitted by the Senate on February 13, 2021, with 57 senators voting in favor of conviction and 43 voting against Seven Republican senators joined the entire Democratic caucus in voting for conviction: Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania [207] Despite the verdict being for acquittal, the result was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment conviction vote to date In Trump's first impeachment trial, Romney became the first senator to vote to convict a president from his own party [208]\n\n\nReactions\nIn remarks on the Senate floor after the adjournment of the \"Court of Impeachment\", Minority and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for acquittal, said his vote was based on his belief that the Constitution did not permit the Senate to convict an ex-president [189]: S735  He noted that Trump \"didn't get away with anything yet\" because the criminal justice system could still deal with the situation [218] He added:\n\n\nSenate\nIn remarks on the Senate floor after the adjournment of the \"Court of Impeachment\", Minority and Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who voted for acquittal, said his vote was based on his belief that the Constitution did not permit the Senate to convict an ex-president [189]: S735  He noted that Trump \"didn't get away with anything yet\" because the criminal justice system could still deal with the situation [218] He added:\n\n\nHouse\nJamie Raskin hailed the effort as the \"most bipartisan presidential impeachment in the history of the United States\"; stated that \"Trump stormed our House with the mob he incited and we defended our House\"; and referred to McConnell's speech as confirmation that the House had proved their case and that the Senate had merely punted on their responsibility over a debunked technicality than on the merits [224]\n\n\nFormer President Trump\nAfter the Senate vote, former President Trump released a statement calling the trial \"yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country\" and asserting that his movement had \"only just begun.\" [226]\n\n\nPresident Biden\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement following the acquittal that day He noted the sacrifice of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who had lain in honor in the Capitol Rotunda days earlier, the bipartisanship of the impeachment and the trial, and McConnell's speech laying responsibility on Trump He stated that \"democracy is fragile\" and must always be defended, and that \"violence and extremism have no place in America\" [227]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter being acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial, Trump has continued to face legal troubles, including the threat of criminal action or civil litigation [228] The prospect that Trump could face a criminal prosecution or civil lawsuit arising from the Capitol assault was raised by a number of Republican members of Congress, including Representative Liz Cheney, [229] Senator Marco Rubio and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell [228]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on January 22, 2021, found that 51% of Americans favored conviction of Trump in the Senate, 37% opposed, and 12% were unsure 55% of Americans supported the Senate disqualifying Trump from holding federal office in the future; 34% opposed this step, and 11% said they were unsure [241]\n\n\nSee also\nHouse

{"title": "Saving_Private_Ryan", "content": "\nPlot\nOn June 6, 1944, the U.S Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and machine gun fire of the heavily fortified German forces Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory.\n\n\nCast\nThe cast also includes Glenn Wrage as Doyle, Corey Johnson as a radioman, John Sharian as Corporal Loeb, and Rolf Saxon as Lieutenant Briggs—Allied soldiers at the Omaha beach landing [8] [9] Demetri Goritsas and Dylan Bruno portray Parker and Private First Class Toynbe, respectively, who aid in the battle of Ramelle [8] Joerg Stadler appears as Steamboat Willie, a German prisoner [5] [9] Amanda Boxer portrays Ryan's mother, while Harrison Young and Kathleen Byron portray the elderly James Ryan and his wife, Margaret [8] [9] Technical advisor and Marine veteran Dale Dye appears as a War Department colonel [8]\n\n\nProduction\nProducer Mark Gordon was a fan of writer Robert Rodat's previous work on films such as Tall Tale (1995) and Fly Away Home (1996) The pair met in early 1995 to discuss potential projects and ideas Within a few weeks, Rodat conceived of Saving Private Ryan [10] [11] He was inspired by a gift from his wife, the historical book D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II (1994), by Stephen E Ambrose, recounting the events of the Normandy landings Rodat visited a monument in Keene, New Hampshire dedicated to American soldiers killed in combat; he noticed the losses included brothers He said, \"The idea of losing a son to war is painful beyond description .. the idea of losing more than one son is inconceivable\" [10] [11] [12] The Ryan family was based on the four Niland brothers detailed in Ambrose's book, who were deployed during WWII; two were killed and a third presumed dead; per the Sole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war [10] [13] [14]\n\n\nConcept\nProducer Mark Gordon was a fan of writer Robert Rodat's previous work on films such as Tall Tale (1995) and Fly Away Home (1996) The pair met in early 1995 to discuss potential projects and ideas Within a few weeks, Rodat conceived of Saving Private Ryan [10] [11] He was inspired by a gift from his wife, the historical book D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II (1994), by Stephen E Ambrose, recounting the events of the Normandy landings Rodat visited a monument in Keene, New Hampshire dedicated to American soldiers killed in combat;

two were killed and a third presumed dead; per the Sole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war [10] [13] [14]\n\n\nDevelopment\nTo develop Saving Private Ryan, Gordon founded the independent film studio Mutual Film Company, alongside producer Gary Levinsohn [10] Gordon brought Rodat's draft to Paramount Pictures executives; they responded positively and hired Rodat who wrote the script over the following 12 months [10] [11] [15] Michael Bay was hired as director, but left the project because he could not resolve how to approach the material [16] [17] Carin Sage, a junior agent representing Tom Hanks at the Creative Artists Agency, gave the script to Hanks, who was immediately interested and met with Gordon and Levinsohn [10] [11] [15] Hanks shared the script with Steven Spielberg who agreed to direct because the pair had wanted to work together for some time [10] [15] Rodat thought that Paramount would cancel the project after the studio purchased two other WWII-era scripts, Combat and With Wings as Eagles, with popular actors Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger attached, respectively [10] However, having secured the involvement of Hanks and Spielberg, two of the highest-paid and most successful actors and directors, Gordon suggested Paramount executives prioritize Saving Private Ryan [10]\n\n\nRewrite\nSpielberg's initial concept for Saving Private Ryan was a Boys' Own–style adventure film in which the search for Ryan was a public relations effort by the war department However, after interviewing WWII veterans for research, he found this idea inappropriate He decided to embed the story within a realistic portrayal of actual events while portraying the conflicted morality of sending men into life-threatening situations to save one man [b] He said, \"I cannot tell you how many veterans came up to me .. and said: 'Please be honest about it Please don't make another Hollywood movie about WWII Please tell our stories ...'\" The surviving Niland family was interviewed, and the story was further influenced by other substantial family war losses, including the five Sullivan brothers killed during WWII, and the Bixby brothers during the American Civil War; the resulting letter by Abraham Lincoln is quoted in the film [14]\n\n\nCasting\nSpielberg wanted older actors for his main cast, claiming that young soldiers would look older than their age under the stresses of war [18] Miller is the \"adult in the story,\" intended to project a calmness and feeling of safety that is undermined by the character's uncontrollable handshaking [19] Spielberg wanted Hanks to play Miller because he was the only actor he thought of who would not \"want to use his teeth to pull out a pin from a hand grenade\" [18] Hanks formed Miller's character based on the history of the 2nd Ranger Battalion before Omaha Beach, saying he believed Miller was \"horribly afraid\" of getting more of his men killed [19] Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford were considered for the role [36] Miller's detachment is a diverse group, including a Jew and Italian, reminiscent of earlier WWII films; this was not a deliberate choice, although Spielberg believed he had subconsciously drawn on conventional WWII films [37] Burns described Reiben as a \"wise guy\" in the script, but the experience of filming the Omaha Beach landing inspired him to give the character a \"much harder edge\" [25] Sizemore was cast in The Thin Red Line (1998) when Spielberg offered him an alternative role as Horvath, Miller's friend, and confidant [19] [37] The actor had a history of drug addiction, and Spielberg mandated that he pass regular drug tests to keep his part, or the role would be recast and his scenes re-shot [38] [13] Describing his character, Sizemore said, \"he was a quiet man; he was taciturn; he followed orders, and he loved the captain .. if he had a tragic flaw, it was that he didn't know when he had had enough when it was time to say, 'I can't do this anymore.'\" [39]\n\n\nPre-production\nThe pre-production for Saving Private Ryan was truncated because Spielberg chose to film Amistad (1997) immediately after finishing work on The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński spent several weeks performing camera tests to define the film's visual aesthetic The pair considered filming monochromatically as Spielberg had with his Holocaust film, Schindler's List (1993) However, they considered that this would seem \"pretentious,\" and were interested in emulating the colored WWII footage from their research Kamiński let his interpretation of the narrative dictate how to light scenes and narrowed down visual styles by identifying which films he did not want Saving Private Ryan to emulate [12] He and Spielberg were visually influenced by WWII documentaries, such as Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944), The Battle of Midway (1942), Why We Fight (1942–1945), and the Nazi propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl They also looked at various books, paintings, and photographs of the Omaha Beach invasion taken by the war photographer Robert Capa [20] Kamiński wanted it to look like a major production \"shot on  [16 mm film] by a bunch of combat cameramen\" [12]\n\n\nFilming in Ireland\nPrincipal photography began on June 27, 1997 [48] [49] Filming completed up to 50 shots per day Spielberg wanted the actors to get little rest, \"A war is fought fast, and I really wanted to keep all of the actors off-balance I didn't want them to be able to read 75 pages of a novel .. I wanted to work fast enough so that they always felt as if they were in combat .. I had to keep them on the set, which meant shooting the film even faster than I normally do War doesn't give you a break.\" [14] [20] Saving Private Ryan was shot almost entirely in continuity order, although some of the crew found this \"a mentally demoralizing experience\" because the cast started together and left as their characters died [18] [14] [20]\n\n\nFilming in England and France\nFilming relocated to the Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England, at the end of August, for the remaining scenes and the battle of Ramelle [j] French towns and rivers were scouted where a partial set could be built, but this was discarded over environmental concerns of filming contaminating the water Instead, Sanders and his team built the fictional Ramelle on the grounds of the Aerodrome, based on five towns where fighting took place Nearly three city blocks long, the set included fully built buildings, facades, and a custom built, 900 ft (270 m) long river The river was lined because they \"had to control the height of the water very carefully\" Explosives were used to create bomb craters and damage around Ramelle [k]\n\n\nPost-production\nKamiński chose to render his footage using Technicolor's proprietary ENR process (similar to a bleach bypass) which retained more silver in the film stock and produced deeper blacks He used \"70 percent ENR\" for a desaturated image which added a blue hue Concerned this change would make the fake blood appear inauthentic, the effects department mixed blue coloring into it, giving it a dark red appearance [12] Visual-effects studio Industrial Light & Magic provided digital enhancements; many bullet wounds and blood splatter were computer-generated imagery [26]\n\n\nMusic\nA long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, produced the score [59] [60] Spielberg chose little music accompaniment, wanting the sounds of battle and death to be prominent Using a spotting process, he and Williams watched a rough cut of the film to agree on which scenes would feature music [60] [61] Williams deliberately avoided \"anything grandiose or operatic\" [60] Williams recorded the 55-minute score over three days at Symphony Hall in Boston, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and vocals by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus [61] [60] [62] The recording cost about $100,000 per hour [60] Spielberg chose the Orchestra: \"This is a movie about a company of soldiers, and it seemed appropriate to use an experienced company of musicians who are all virtuosos Also we really wanted the sound of this room, Symphony Hall On a soundstage you can get acoustically correct sound, but you don't hear the air Here you get a rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling, and you do hear the air; Symphony Hall is an instrument too.\" [60]\n\n\nRelease\nThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May with Deep Impact, a surprise box office hit that studios saw as a positive indicator for their upcoming 100 film releases [63] [64] Godzilla and Armageddon were expected to be the biggest successes, while industry executives were hopeful for smaller budget films (costing less than $60 million) like Small Soldiers, The Negotiator, The Parent Trap, and There's Something About Mary to become sleeper hits Fewer sequels and less escapist entertainment were scheduled for release, and more films were targeted toward older audiences [64] [63] [10] Saving Private Ryan was highly anticipated but analysis suggested the film faced commercial limitations because of its long runtime, restricting the number of times it could be screened daily, and its violent content [10] [64] [63]  DreamWorks' marketing chief Terry Press said it was risky to release a serious drama in the summer, a time generally reserved for family and escapist entertainment, but this was offset by Spielberg and Hanks's popularity [15] A screening for DreamWorks and Paramount executives was highly praised, [11] but Spielberg had low expectations, believing the film was too violent to attract broad audiences [65]\n\n\nContext\nThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May with Deep Impact, a surprise box office hit

1998 The event was a low-profile affair without a party or many celebrities; Press said of the premiere, \"it would have been inappropriate\" [66] Saving Private Ryan was released in the United States and Canada on July 24, 1998 [10] [67] During its opening weekend, it  earned $30.6 million across 2,463 theaters—an average of $12,414 per theater [67] [10] This figure made it the number-one film of the weekend, ahead of The Mask of Zorro ($13.4 million) in its second weekend, Lethal Weapon 4 ($13.1 million) in its third, and There's Something About Mary ($12.5 million), also in its second [68] [15] The audience was split evenly between women and men, and skewed towards those aged over 25 The New York Times described it as unusual for a near-three-hour-long drama to perform so well on its opening weekend, crediting positive reviews DreamWorks believed the box-office figure would have been higher if not for a delay in film prints arriving in hundreds of theaters across California and Arizona until late in the afternoon [15]\n\n\nReception\nSaving Private Ryan received critical acclaim, [27] [79] and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale [80] Critics generally agreed that Saving Private Ryan presented the grim and brutal reality of the \"Good War\" in a way previously unseen on film [o] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan described the film as darker and more pessimistic than any of Spielberg's previous works, dispelling the mythos of WWII as staunchly good heroes fighting against evil forces, to depict the reality of combat where, \"American soldiers mock virtue and shoot surrendering Germans, where decent and altruistic actions tend to be fatal, where death is random, stupid and redeems hardly anything at all\" [81] [84] Some reviewers said this exploration of the limitations of morality in combat asked audiences to consider that the lives lost during the conflict were as valuable as those saved by their sacrifices Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel lauded the film's ability to discuss the \"brutality and madness\" of war while \"believably\" celebrating the sacrifices and courage of those fighting it [83] [58] [85] Salon.com's Gary Kamiya concluded, \"it will forever change the way people imagine the most important event in 20th century history That is no small achievement.\" [81] In The New York Times, Stephen Holden said \"it's a safe bet that Saving Private Ryan, a powerful but flawed movie, will be revered as a classic decades hence.\" [76]\n\n\nCritical

Private Ryan won Best Drama and Best Director (Spielberg), and was nominated for Best Drama Actor (Hanks), Best Original Score (Williams), and Best Screenplay (Rodat) [90] [91] At the 71st Academy Awards, Saving Private Ryan won Best Director (Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Kamiński), Best Film Editing (Kahn), Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers, Andy Nelson, Ronald Judkins), and Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Richard Hymns) while it was nominated for Best Actor (Hanks), Best Original Screenplay (Rodat), Best Music (Williams), Best Production Design (Sanders and Lisa Dean Kavanaugh), and Best Makeup (Lois Burwell, Conor O'Sullivan, Daniel C Striepeke) [92] Saving Private Ryan's unexpected loss of Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love is seen as one of the biggest upsets in the awards history and led to DreamWorks executives accusing its producers, Miramax, of \"overly aggressive campaigning\" [r] A 2015 poll of Academy voters suggested that, given another opportunity, they would have voted Saving Private Ryan as Best Picture [98]\n\n\nPost-release\nSeveral publications highlighted the accuracy of the Omaha Beach assault, down to the sound of gunfire,

[132]\n\n\nThematic analysis\nLeading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America on glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such as Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), books such as The Greatest Generation (1998), and construction of a World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C [t] Many publications believed this resurgence of interest in the war to be a response to decades of American cynicism toward the nation's failure in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in the Cold and Gulf Wars that resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration [u]\n\n\nPatriotism\nLeading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America on glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such as Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), books such as The Greatest Generation (1998), and construction of a World

(1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in the Cold and Gulf Wars that resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration [u]\n\n\nMorality and humanity\nUnlike some older WWII films that portrayed the soldiers as infallible heroes, Saving Private Ryan presents battles fought by brave but frightened civilians, the majority of whom at Omaha Beach were not combat veterans [137] [28] Ebert believed much of the audience, including himself, would identify with Upham, someone completely unprepared for the realities of war but who must fight regardless [58] Miller is the opposite: an experienced soldier who is scared and anxious because he knows exactly what to expect and is haunted by his responsibility for the lives of his men [137] [28] [84] [4] Although 94 men have died under his command, Miller rationalizes that he can prioritize his mission over his men because each sacrifice was responsible for saving many more lives However, his mission to rescue Ryan demands he risk the lives of several men to save just one [137] Turan said Miller's trembling hands were a sign that he is \"dangerously close to coming apart\" [84] Far Out magazine wrote that the focus on Miller's ailment acknowledges the side effects of war such as post-traumatic stress disorder, something he suppresses to fulfil his duty [4]\n\n\nLegacy\nSaving Private Ryan was credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century [146] [27] [147] NBC News wrote that in presenting audiences with its \"stomach-churning violence and soul-shaking intensity of that pivotal chapter in the war\", the film had reshaped the United States' \"cultural memory\" [148]  It is regarded as one of the most accurate and realistic war films ever made, particularly for the opening Omaha Beach battle [149] [148] Film historian Steven Jay Rubin said, \"It was a game-changer .. it was devastatingly dramatic, visceral, immersive I didn't touch my popcorn because it felt sacrilegious to eat while I'm watching it.\" [148] Even so, director and Vietnam War veteran Oliver Stone claimed that Saving Private Ryan depicted a \"worship\" of WWII as \"the good war\" that, alongside films such as Gladiator (2000) and Black Hawk Down, made audiences more in favor of war: \"By the time of the Iraq War, we were ready to go back.\" [150] American academic Paul Fussell similarly decried Saving Private Ryan for providing an \"honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening\" of Omaha Beach before descending into more broadly acceptable action-adventure fare He said, \"Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians, with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious.\" [151]\n\n\nCultural influence\nSaving Private Ryan was credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century [146] [27] [147] NBC

[151]\n\n\nModern reception\nSaving Private Ryan is considered one of the greatest war films ever made [x] In a 2018 interview, Spielberg said, \"I didn't anticipate the success of the movie .. in very early screenings, certain associates and other people in my life were saying that I made it too tough I feared that almost nobody would see it because the word of mouth would spread quickly after the first 25 minutes.\" [19]\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Saving Private Ryan**\n\nSaving Private

two were killed and a third presumed dead; per the Sole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war [10] [13] [14]\n\n\nConcept\nProducer Mark Gordon was a fan of writer Robert Rodat's previous work on films such as Tall Tale (1995) and Fly Away Home (1996) The pair met in early 1995 to discuss potential projects and ideas Within a few weeks, Rodat conceived of Saving Private Ryan [10] [11] He was inspired by a gift from his wife, the historical book D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II (1994), by Stephen E Ambrose, recounting the events of the Normandy landings Rodat visited a monument in Keene, New Hampshire dedicated to American soldiers killed in combat;

two were killed and a third presumed dead; per the Sole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war [10] [13] [14]\n\n\nDevelopment\nTo develop Saving Private Ryan, Gordon founded the independent film studio Mutual Film Company, alongside producer Gary Levinsohn [10] Gordon brought Rodat's draft to Paramount Pictures executives; they responded positively and hired Rodat who wrote the script over the following 12 months [10] [11] [15] Michael Bay was hired as director, but left the project because he could not resolve how to approach the material [16] [17] Carin Sage, a junior agent representing Tom Hanks at the Creative Artists Agency, gave the script to Hanks, who was immediately interested and met with Gordon and Levinsohn [10] [11] [15] Hanks shared the script with Steven Spielberg who agreed to direct because the pair had wanted to work together for some time [10] [15] Rodat thought that Paramount would cancel the project after the studio purchased two other WWII-era scripts, Combat and With Wings as Eagles, with popular actors Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger attached, respectively [10] However, having secured the involvement of Hanks and Spielberg, two of the highest-paid and most successful actors and directors, Gordon suggested Paramount executives prioritize Saving Private Ryan [10]\n\n\nRewrite\nSpielberg's initial concept for Saving Private Ryan was a Boys' Own–style adventure film in which the search for Ryan was a public relations effort by the war department However, after interviewing WWII veterans for research, he found this idea inappropriate He decided to embed the story within a realistic portrayal of actual events while portraying the conflicted morality of sending men into life-threatening situations to save one man [b] He said, \"I cannot tell you how many veterans came up to me .. and said: 'Please be honest about it Please don't make another Hollywood movie about WWII Please tell our stories ...'\" The surviving Niland family was interviewed, and the story was further influenced by other substantial family war losses, including the five Sullivan brothers killed during WWII, and the Bixby brothers during the American Civil War; the resulting letter by Abraham Lincoln is quoted in the film [14]\n\n\nCasting\nSpielberg wanted older actors for his main cast, claiming that young soldiers would look older than their age under the stresses of war [18] Miller is the \"adult in the story,\" intended to project a calmness and feeling of safety that is undermined by the character's uncontrollable handshaking [19] Spielberg wanted Hanks to play Miller because he was the only actor he thought of who would not \"want to use his teeth to pull out a pin from a hand grenade\" [18] Hanks formed Miller's character based on the history of the 2nd Ranger Battalion before Omaha Beach, saying he believed Miller was \"horribly afraid\" of getting more of his men killed [19] Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford were considered for the role [36] Miller's detachment is a diverse group, including a Jew and Italian, reminiscent of earlier WWII films; this was not a deliberate choice, although Spielberg believed he had subconsciously drawn on conventional WWII films [37] Burns described Reiben as a \"wise guy\" in the script, but the experience of filming the Omaha Beach landing inspired him to give the character a \"much harder edge\" [25] Sizemore was cast in The Thin Red Line (1998) when Spielberg offered him an alternative role as Horvath, Miller's friend, and confidant [19] [37] The actor had a history of drug addiction, and Spielberg mandated that he pass regular drug tests to keep his part, or the role would be recast and his scenes re-shot [38] [13] Describing his character, Sizemore said, \"he was a quiet man; he was taciturn; he followed orders, and he loved the captain .. if he had a tragic flaw, it was that he didn't know when he had had enough when it was time to say, 'I can't do this anymore.'\" [39]\n\n\nPre-production\nThe pre-production for Saving Private Ryan was truncated because Spielberg chose to film Amistad (1997) immediately after finishing work on The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński spent several weeks performing camera tests to define the film's visual aesthetic The pair considered filming monochromatically as Spielberg had with his Holocaust film, Schindler's List (1993) However, they considered that this would seem \"pretentious,\" and were interested in emulating the colored WWII footage from their research Kamiński let his interpretation of the narrative dictate how to light scenes and narrowed down visual styles by identifying which films he did not want Saving Private Ryan to emulate [12] He and Spielberg were visually influenced by WWII documentaries, such as Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944), The Battle of Midway (1942), Why We Fight (1942–1945), and the Nazi propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl They also looked at various books, paintings, and photographs of the Omaha Beach invasion taken by the war photographer Robert Capa [20] Kamiński wanted it to look like a major production \"shot on  [16 mm film] by a bunch of combat cameramen\" [12]\n\n\nFilming in Ireland\nPrincipal photography began on June 27, 1997 [48] [49] Filming completed up to 50 shots per day Spielberg wanted the actors to get little rest, \"A war is fought fast, and I really wanted to keep all of the actors off-balance I didn't want them to be able to read 75 pages of a novel .. I wanted to work fast enough so that they always felt as if they were in combat .. I had to keep them on the set, which meant shooting the film even faster than I normally do War doesn't give you a break.\" [14] [20] Saving Private Ryan was shot almost entirely in continuity order, although some of the crew found this \"a mentally demoralizing experience\" because the cast started together and left as their characters died [18] [14] [20]\n\n\nFilming in England and France\nFilming relocated to the Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England, at the end of August, for the remaining scenes and the battle of Ramelle [j] French towns and rivers were scouted where a partial set could be built, but this was discarded over environmental concerns of filming contaminating the water Instead, Sanders and his team built the fictional Ramelle on the grounds of the Aerodrome, based on five towns where fighting took place Nearly three city blocks long, the set included fully built buildings, facades, and a custom built, 900 ft (270 m) long river The river was lined because they \"had to control the height of the water very carefully\" Explosives were used to create bomb craters and damage around Ramelle [k]\n\n\nPost-production\nKamiński chose to render his footage using Technicolor's proprietary ENR process (similar to a bleach bypass) which retained more silver in the film stock and produced deeper blacks He used \"70 percent ENR\" for a desaturated image which added a blue hue Concerned this change would make the fake blood appear inauthentic, the effects department mixed blue coloring into it, giving it a dark red appearance [12] Visual-effects studio Industrial Light & Magic provided digital enhancements; many bullet wounds and blood splatter were computer-generated imagery [26]\n\n\nMusic\nA long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, produced the score [59] [60] Spielberg chose little music accompaniment, wanting the sounds of battle and death to be prominent Using a spotting process, he and Williams watched a rough cut of the film to agree on which scenes would feature music [60] [61] Williams deliberately avoided \"anything grandiose or operatic\" [60] Williams recorded the 55-minute score over three days at Symphony Hall in Boston, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and vocals by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus [61] [60] [62] The recording cost about $100,000 per hour [60] Spielberg chose the Orchestra: \"This is a movie about a company of soldiers, and it seemed appropriate to use an experienced company of musicians who are all virtuosos Also we really wanted the sound of this room, Symphony Hall On a soundstage you can get acoustically correct sound, but you don't hear the air Here you get a rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling, and you do hear the air; Symphony Hall is an instrument too.\" [60]\n\n\nRelease\nThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May with Deep Impact, a surprise box office hit that studios saw as a positive indicator for their upcoming 100 film releases [63] [64] Godzilla and Armageddon were expected to be the biggest successes, while industry executives were hopeful for smaller budget films (costing less than $60 million) like Small Soldiers, The Negotiator, The Parent Trap, and There's Something About Mary to become sleeper hits Fewer sequels and less escapist entertainment were scheduled for release, and more films were targeted toward older audiences [64] [63] [10] Saving Private Ryan was highly anticipated but analysis suggested the film faced commercial limitations because of its long runtime, restricting the number of times it could be screened daily, and its violent content [10] [64] [63]  DreamWorks' marketing chief Terry Press said it was risky to release a serious drama in the summer, a time generally reserved for family and escapist entertainment, but this was offset by Spielberg and Hanks's popularity [15] A screening for DreamWorks and Paramount executives was highly praised, [11] but Spielberg had low expectations, believing the film was too violent to attract broad audiences [65]\n\n\nContext\nThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May with Deep Impact, a surprise box office hit

1998 The event was a low-profile affair without a party or many celebrities; Press said of the premiere, \"it would have been inappropriate\" [66] Saving Private Ryan was released in the United States and Canada on July 24, 1998 [10] [67] During its opening weekend, it  earned $30.6 million across 2,463 theaters—an average of $12,414 per theater [67] [10] This figure made it the number-one film of the weekend, ahead of The Mask of Zorro ($13.4 million) in its second weekend, Lethal Weapon 4 ($13.1 million) in its third, and There's Something About Mary ($12.5 million), also in its second [68] [15] The audience was split evenly between women and men, and skewed towards those aged over 25 The New York Times described it as unusual for a near-three-hour-long drama to perform so well on its opening weekend, crediting positive reviews DreamWorks believed the box-office figure would have been higher if not for a delay in film prints arriving in hundreds of theaters across California and Arizona until late in the afternoon [15]\n\n\nReception\nSaving Private Ryan received critical acclaim, [27] [79] and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale [80] Critics generally agreed that Saving Private Ryan presented the grim and brutal reality of the \"Good War\" in a way previously unseen on film [o] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan described the film as darker and more pessimistic than any of Spielberg's previous works, dispelling the mythos of WWII as staunchly good heroes fighting against evil forces, to depict the reality of combat where, \"American soldiers mock virtue and shoot surrendering Germans, where decent and altruistic actions tend to be fatal, where death is random, stupid and redeems hardly anything at all\" [81] [84] Some reviewers said this exploration of the limitations of morality in combat asked audiences to consider that the lives lost during the conflict were as valuable as those saved by their sacrifices Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel lauded the film's ability to discuss the \"brutality and madness\" of war while \"believably\" celebrating the sacrifices and courage of those fighting it [83] [58] [85] Salon.com's Gary Kamiya concluded, \"it will forever change the way people imagine the most important event in 20th century history That is no small achievement.\" [81] In The New York Times, Stephen Holden said \"it's a safe bet that Saving Private Ryan, a powerful but flawed movie, will be revered as a classic decades hence.\" [76]\n\n\nCritical

Private Ryan won Best Drama and Best Director (Spielberg), and was nominated for Best Drama Actor (Hanks), Best Original Score (Williams), and Best Screenplay (Rodat) [90] [91] At the 71st Academy Awards, Saving Private Ryan won Best Director (Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Kamiński), Best Film Editing (Kahn), Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers, Andy Nelson, Ronald Judkins), and Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Richard Hymns) while it was nominated for Best Actor (Hanks), Best Original Screenplay (Rodat), Best Music (Williams), Best Production Design (Sanders and Lisa Dean Kavanaugh), and Best Makeup (Lois Burwell, Conor O'Sullivan, Daniel C Striepeke) [92] Saving Private Ryan's unexpected loss of Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love is seen as one of the biggest upsets in the awards history and led to DreamWorks executives accusing its producers, Miramax, of \"overly aggressive campaigning\" [r] A 2015 poll of Academy voters suggested that, given another opportunity, they would have voted Saving Private Ryan as Best Picture [98]\n\n\nPost-release\nSeveral publications highlighted the accuracy of the Omaha Beach assault, down to the sound of gunfire, although some errors were noted, such as bullets killing soldiers underwater, the absence of British coxswains steering the boats, and the battle's truncated duration [13] [93] [111] [112] Historical

1999 [120] [27] A limited edition two-VHS version was released in November 1999, adding a making-of documentary, as well as a message from Spielberg about D-Day and the National D-Day Museum [120]\n\n\nOther media\nA novelization, written by Max Allan Collins and Rodat, was released alongside the film [129] [130] Saving Private Ryan: The Men, the Mission, the Movie : A Film by Steven Spielberg was also released in 1998 It features illustrations, color plates, extracts from the screenplay and Ambrose's works, as well as commentary by crew including Spielberg, Hanks, and Damon [131] [132]\n\n\nThematic analysis\nLeading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America on glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such as Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), books such as The Greatest Generation (1998), and construction of a World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C [t] Many publications believed this resurgence of interest in the war to be a response to decades of American cynicism toward the nation's failure in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in the Cold and Gulf Wars that resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration [u]\n\n\nPatriotism\nLeading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America on glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such as Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001), books such as The Greatest Generation (1998), and construction of a World

(1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in the Cold and Gulf Wars that resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration [u]\n\n\nMorality and humanity\nUnlike some older WWII films that portrayed the soldiers as infallible heroes, Saving Private Ryan presents battles fought by brave but frightened civilians, the majority of whom at Omaha Beach were not combat veterans [137] [28] Ebert believed much of the audience, including himself, would identify with Upham, someone completely unprepared for the realities of war but who must fight regardless [58] Miller is the opposite: an experienced soldier who is scared and anxious because he knows exactly what to expect and is haunted by his responsibility for the lives of his men [137] [28] [84] [4] Although 94 men have died under his command, Miller rationalizes that he can prioritize his mission over his men because each sacrifice was responsible for saving many more lives However, his mission to rescue Ryan demands he risk the lives of several men to save just one [137] Turan said Miller's trembling hands were a sign that he is \"dangerously close to coming apart\" [84] Far Out magazine wrote that the focus on Miller's ailment acknowledges the side effects of war such as post-traumatic stress disorder, something he suppresses to fulfil his duty [4]\n\n\nLegacy\nSaving Private Ryan was credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century [146] [27] [147] NBC News wrote that in presenting audiences with its \"stomach-churning violence and soul-shaking intensity of that pivotal chapter in the war\", the film had reshaped the United States' \"cultural memory\" [148]  It is regarded as one of the most accurate and realistic war films ever made, particularly for the opening Omaha Beach battle [149] [148] Film historian Steven Jay Rubin said, \"It was a game-changer .. it was devastatingly dramatic, visceral, immersive I didn't touch my popcorn because it felt sacrilegious to eat while I'm watching it.\" [148] Even so, director and Vietnam War veteran Oliver Stone claimed that Saving Private Ryan depicted a \"worship\" of WWII as \"the good war\" that, alongside films such as Gladiator (2000) and Black Hawk Down, made audiences more in favor of war: \"By the time of the Iraq War, we were ready to go back.\" [150] American academic Paul Fussell similarly decried Saving Private Ryan for providing an \"honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening\" of Omaha Beach before descending into more broadly acceptable action-adventure fare He said, \"Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians, with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious.\" [151]\n\n\nCultural influence\nSaving Private Ryan was credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century [146] [27] [147] NBC

[151]\n\n\nModern reception\nSaving Private Ryan is considered one of the greatest war films ever made [x] In a 2018 interview, Spielberg said, \"I didn't anticipate the success of the movie .. in very early screenings, certain associates and other people in my life were saying that I made it too tough I feared that almost nobody would see it because the word of mouth would spread quickly after the first 25 minutes.\" [19]\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda [41] Nine years later, shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas [42] [43] Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in the area, \"half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us.\" [44] Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas [c] [46] Francisco Vázquez de Coronado described another encounter with native people in 1541 [d] [48]\n\n\nRepublic\nWithin Mexico, tensions continued between federalists and centralists In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety [82] The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales [83] This launched the Texas Revolution Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government [84] The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836 [85]\n\n\nStatehood\nTexas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K Polk won the election of 1844 [97] On December 29, 1845, the U.S Congress admitted Texas to the U.S [98]\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River leaving the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty [98] While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846 A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas [99]\n\n\nCivil War to late 19th century\nTexas re-entered war following the election of 1860 During this time, Black people comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved [103] When Abraham Lincoln was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union; five other Deep South states quickly followed A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861 On February 1, by a vote of 166–8, the convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861 Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861, ratifying the permanent C.S Constitution on March 23 [1] [104]\n\n\nEarly to mid-20th century\nIn 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S history during the Galveston hurricane [116] On January 10, 1901, the first major oil well in Texas, Spindletop, was found south of Beaumont Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico The resulting \"oil boom\" transformed Texas [117] Oil production averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972 [118]\n\n\nMid-20th to early 21st century\nBeginning around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized [129] The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state [129] As a part of the Sun Belt, Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s [129] Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry [129] By 1990, Hispanics and Latino Americans overtook Blacks to become the largest minority group [129] Texas has the largest Black population with over 3.9 million [130]\n\n\nGeography\nTexas is the second-largest U.S state by area, after Alaska, and the largest state within the contiguous United States, at 268,820 square miles (696,200 km2) If it were an independent country, Texas would be the 39th-largest [153] It ranks 26th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size.\n\n\nGeology\nTexas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old [161]\n\n\nWildlife\nTexas is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the American green tree frog, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all [166] At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas [167]\n\n\nClimate\nThe large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual rainfall, [171] while parts of southeast Texas average as much as 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year [172] Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year [173]\n\n\nStorms\nThunderstorms strike Texas often, especially the eastern and northern portions of the state Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States, an average of 139 a year These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle [178] Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June [179]\n\n\nGreenhouse gases\nAs of 2017 [update], Texas emitted the most greenhouse gases in the U.S [188] As of 2017 [update] the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide annually [188] As an independent state, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases [189] Causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries [189] In 2010, there were 2,553 \"emission events\" which poured 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tons) of contaminants into the Texas sky [190]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas [195] These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States As of 2020, six Texas cities had populations greater than 600,000 Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso are among the 20 largest U.S cities Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million: Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, Houston–Sugar Land–The Woodlands, San Antonio–New Braunfels, and Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos The Dallas–Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas number about 7.5 million and 7 million residents as of 2019, respectively [196]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe resident population of Texas was 29,145,505 in the 2020 census, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 census [210] [211] At the 2020 census, the apportioned population of Texas stood at 29,183,290 [212] The 2023 Texas Population Estimate program estimated the population was 30,503,301 on July 1, 2023 [213] In 2010, Texas had a census population of 25,145,561 [214] Texas is the second-most populous state in the United States after California and the only other U.S state to surpass a total estimated population of 30 million people as of July 2, 2022 [215] [216]\n\n\nRace and ethnicity\nIn 2019, non-Hispanic Whites represented 41.2% of Texas's population, reflecting a national demographic shift [225] [226] [227] Black people made up 12.9%, American Indians and Alaska Natives 1.0%, Asian Americans 5.2%, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 0.1%, some other race 0.2%, and two or more races 1.8% Hispanics or Latino Americans of any race made up 39.7% of the estimated population [228]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe most common accent or dialect spoken by natives throughout Texas is sometimes referred to as Texan English, itself a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English [240] [241] Creole language is spoken in some parts of East Texas [242] In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities—Western American English and General American English, is increasingly common Chicano English—due to a growing Hispanic population—is widespread in South Texas, while African-American English is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas.\n\n\nReligion\nWith the coming of Spanish Catholic and American Protestant missionary societies, [247] Indigenous American Indian religions and spiritual traditions dwindled Since then, colonial and present-day Texas has become a predominantly Christian state, with 75.5% of the population identifying as such according to the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020 [248]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of 2024, Texas had a gross state product (GSP) of $2.664 trillion, the second highest in the U.S [259] Its GSP is greater than the GDP of Brazil,  the world's 8th-largest economy [260] The state ranks 22nd among U.S states with a median household income of $64,034, while the poverty rate is 14.2%, making Texas the state with 14th highest poverty rate (compared to 13.15% nationally) Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California.\n\n\nTaxation\nTexas has a reputation for a low tax [266] According to the Tax Foundation, Texans' state and local tax burdens are seventh-lowest nationally; state and local taxes cost $3,580 per capita, or 8.4 percent of resident incomes [267] Texas is one of seven states that lack a state income tax [267] [268]\n\n\nAgriculture and mining\nTexas has the most farms and the highest acreage in the United States The state is ranked No. 1 for revenue generated from total livestock and livestock products It is ranked No. 2 for total agricultural revenue, behind California [273] At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas's annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broiler chickens at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent) [274]\n\n\nEnergy\nEver since the discovery of oil at Spindletop, energy has been a dominant force politically and economically within the state [278] If Texas were its own country it would be the sixth-largest oil producer in the world according to a 2014 study [279]\n\n\nTechnology\nWith large universities systems coupled with initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, a wide array of different high tech industries have developed in Texas The Austin area is nicknamed the \"Silicon Hills\" and the north Dallas area the \"Silicon Prairie\" Many high-tech companies are located in or have their headquarters in Texas (and Austin in particular), including Dell, Inc., [296] Borland, [297] Forcepoint, [298] Indeed.com, [299] Texas Instruments, [300] Perot Systems, [301] Rackspace and AT&T [302] [303] [304]\n\n\nCommerce\nTexas's affluence stimulates a strong commercial sector consisting of retail, wholesale, banking and insurance, and construction industries Examples of Fortune 500 companies not based on Texas traditional industries are AT&T, Kimberly-Clark, Blockbuster, J C Penney, Whole Foods Market, and Tenet Healthcare [310]\n\n\nCulture\nHistorically, Texas culture comes from a blend of mostly Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world [313] [314]\n\n\nTexas self-perception\n\"Texas-sized\" describes something that is about the size of the U.S state of Texas, [317] [318] or something (usually but not always originating from Texas) that is large compared to other objects of its type [319] [320] [321] Texas was the largest U.S state until Alaska became a state in 1959 The phrase \"everything is bigger in Texas\" has been in regular use since at least 1950 [322]\n\n\nArts\nHouston is one of only five American cities with permanent professional resident companies in all the major performing arts disciplines: the Houston Grand Opera, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre [323] Known for the vibrancy of its visual and performing arts, the Houston Theater District ranks second in the country in the number of theater seats in a concentrated downtown area, with 12,948 seats for live performances and 1,480 movie seats [323]\nFounded in 1892, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, also called \"The Modern\", is Texas's oldest art museum Fort Worth also has the Kimbell Art Museum, the Amon Carter Museum, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, the Will Rogers Memorial Center, and the Bass Performance Hall downtown The Arts District of Downtown Dallas has arts venues such as the Dallas Museum of Art, the Morton H Meyerson Symphony Center, the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, the Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art, and the Nasher Sculpture Center [324]\n\n\nSports\nWithin the \"Big Four\" professional leagues, Texas has two NFL teams (the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans), two MLB teams (the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers), [331] [332] three NBA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, the Houston Rockets, and the Dallas Mavericks), and one NHL team (the Dallas Stars) The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex is one of only thirteen American metropolitan areas that host sports teams from all the \"Big Four\" professional leagues Outside of the \"Big Four\", Texas also has a WNBA team (the Dallas Wings), three Major League Soccer teams (Austin FC, Houston Dynamo FC and FC Dallas), and one NWSL team (the Houston Dash) [citation needed]\n\n\nEducation\nThe second president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B Lamar, is the Father of Texas Education During his term, the state set aside three leagues in each county for public schools An additional 50 leagues of land set aside for the support of two universities would later become the basis of the state's Permanent University Fund [344] Lamar's actions set the foundation for a Texas-wide public school system [345]\n\n\nHigher education\nThe state's two most widely recognized flagship universities are The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University, ranked as the 21st [354] and 41st [355] best universities in the nation according to 2020's latest Center for World University Rankings report, respectively Some observers [356] also include the University of Houston and Texas Tech University as tier one flagships alongside UT Austin and A&M [357] [358] The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ranks the state's public universities into three distinct tiers: [359]\n\n\nHealthcare\nNotwithstanding the concentration of elite medical centers in the state, The Commonwealth Fund ranks the Texas healthcare system the third worst in the nation [377] Texas ranks close to last in access to healthcare, quality of care, avoidable hospital spending, and equity [377] In May 2006, Texas initiated the program \"code red\" in response to the report the state had 25.1 percent of the population without health insurance, the largest proportion in the nation [378]\n\n\nMedical research\nTexas has many elite research medical centers The state has 15 medical schools, [386] four dental schools, [387] and two optometry schools [388] Texas has two Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, [389] and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio—the first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States [390]\n\n\nTransportation\nThe state's large size and rough terrain have historically complicated transportation Texas has compensated by building the nation's largest highway and railway systems The regulatory authority, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), maintains the state's highway system, regulates aviation, [399] and public transportation systems [400]\n\n\nHighways\nThe first Texas freeway was the Gulf Freeway opened in 1948 in Houston [403] As of 2005, 79,535 miles (127,999 km) of public highway crisscrossed Texas (up from 71,000 miles or 114,000 km in 1984) [citation needed] To fund recent growth in the state highways, Texas has 17 toll roads with several additional tollways proposed [404] In Central Texas, the southern section of the State Highway 130 toll road has a speed limit of 85 miles per hour (137 km/h), the highest in the nation [405] All federal and state highways in Texas are paved.\n\n\nAirports\nTexas has 730 airports, second-most of any state in the nation Largest in Texas by size and passengers served, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is the second-largest by area in the United States, and fourth in the world with 18,076 acres (73.15 km2) [406] In traffic, DFW airport is the busiest in the state, the fourth busiest in the United States, [407] and sixth worldwide [408] Southwest Airlines, headquartered in Dallas, has its operations at Dallas Love Field [409] American Airlines Group's American / American Eagle, the world's largest airline in total passengers-miles transported and passenger fleet size, [410] uses DFW as its largest and main hub.\n\n\nPorts\nAround 1,150 seaports dot Texas's coast with over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of channels [414] Ports employ nearly one-million people and handle an average of 317 million metric tons [415] Texas ports connect with the rest of the U.S Atlantic seaboard with the Gulf section of the Intracoastal Waterway [414] The Port of Houston today is the busiest port in the United States in foreign tonnage, second in overall tonnage, and tenth worldwide in tonnage [416] The Houston Ship Channel spans 530 feet (160 m) wide by 45 feet (14 m) deep by 50 miles (80 km) long [417]\n\n\nRailroads\nPart of the state's tradition of cowboys is derived from the massive cattle drives which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to drive livestock to railroads and markets.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe current Texas Constitution was adopted in 1876 Like many states, it explicitly provides for a separation of powers The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its federal counterpart, and has provisions unique to Texas [428]\n\n\nState government\n31°N 99°W﻿ / ﻿31°N 99°W﻿ / 31; -99﻿ (State of Texas)\n\n\nPolitics\nThe Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the 20th century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens [437] [438]\n\n\nCriminal law\nTexas has a reputation of very harsh criminal punishment for criminal offenses It is one of the 32 states that practice capital punishment, and since the US Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976, 40% of all U.S executions have taken place in Texas [458] As of 2018, Texas had the 8th highest incarceration rate in the U.S [459] Texas also has strong right of self-defense and self defense laws, allowing citizens to use lethal force to defend themselves, their families, or their property [460] Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country [461]\n\n\nSee also\n31°N 99°W﻿ / ﻿31°N 99°W﻿ / 31; -99﻿ (State of Texas)\n\n\nNotes\n31°N 99°W﻿ / ﻿31°N 99°W﻿ / 31; -99﻿ (State of

"article": "Texas is a state in the United States located in the south-central region of the country. It borders Mexico to the south, New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, and Louisiana to the east. Texas has a rich and diverse history, with a unique blend of cultures, landscapes, and economies.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name Texas, based on the Caddo word táy:shaʼ (/tə́jːʃaʔ/), 'friend', was applied, in the spelling Tejas or Texas, by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy.\n\n## History\n\nTexas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas. Archaeologists have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were: the Ancestral Puebloans from the upper Rio Grande region, centered west of Texas; the Mississippian culture, also known as Mound Builders, which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas; and the civilizations of Mesoamerica, which were centered south of Texas. Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\n## Precontact era\n\nTexas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas.

After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas.\n\n## Civil War to late 19th century\n\nTexas re-entered war following the election of 1860. During this time, Black people comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved. When Abraham Lincoln was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union; five other Deep South states quickly followed. A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861. By a vote of 166–8, the convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession. Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861. Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861, ratifying the permanent C.S. Constitution on March 23.\n\n## Early to mid-20th century\n\nIn 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the Galveston hurricane. On January 10, 1901, the first major oil well in Texas, Spindletop, was found south of Beaumont. Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting \"oil boom\" transformed Texas. Oil production averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972.\n\n## Mid-20th to early 21st century\n\nBeginning around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As a part of the Sun Belt, Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics and Latino Americans overtook Blacks to become the largest minority group. Texas has the largest Black population with over 3.9 million.\n\n## Geography\n\nTexas is the second-largest U.S. state by area, after Alaska, and the largest state within the contiguous United States, at 268,820 square miles (696,200 km2). If it were an independent country, Texas would be the 39th-largest. It ranks 26th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size.\n\n## Geology\n\nTexas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton, which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico.

Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year.\n\n## Storms\n\nThunderstorms strike Texas often, especially the eastern and northern portions of the state. Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas. The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States, an average of 139 a year. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle. Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June.\n\n## Greenhouse gases\n\nAs of 2017, Texas emitted the most greenhouse gases in the U.S. As of 2017, the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide annually. As an independent state, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases. Causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries. In 2010, there were 2,553 \"emission events\" which poured 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tons) of contaminants into the Texas sky.\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nThe state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas. These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States. As of 2020, six Texas cities had populations greater than 600,000. Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso are among the 20 largest U.S. cities. Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million: Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, Houston–Sugar Land–The Woodlands, San Antonio–New Braunfels, and Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos. The Dallas–Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas number about 7.5 million and 7 million residents as of 2019, respectively.\n\n## Demographics\n\nThe resident population of Texas was 29,145,505 in the 2020 census, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 census. At the 2020 census, the apportioned population of Texas stood at 29,183,290. The 2023 Texas Population Estimate program estimated the population was 30,503,301 on July 1, 2023. In 2010, Texas had a census population of 25,145,561. Texas is the second-most populous state in the United States after California and the only other U.S. state to surpass a total estimated population of 30 million people as of July 2, 2022.\n\n## Race and ethnicity\n\nIn 2019, non-Hispanic Whites represented 41.2% of Texas's population, reflecting a national demographic shift. Black people made up 12.9%, American Indians and Alaska Natives 1.0%, Asian Americans 5.2%, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 0.1%, some other race 0.2%, and two or more races 1.8%. Hispanics or Latino Americans of any race made up 39.7% of the estimated population.\n\n## Languages\n\nThe most common accent or dialect spoken by natives throughout Texas is sometimes referred to as Texan English, itself a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English. Creole language is spoken in some parts of East Texas. In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities—Western American English and General American English, is increasingly common. Chicano English—due to a growing Hispanic population—is widespread in South Texas, while African-American English is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas.\n\n## Religion\n\nWith the coming of Spanish Catholic and American Protestant missionary societies, Indigenous American Indian religions and spiritual traditions dwindled. Since then, colonial and present-day Texas has become a predominantly Christian state, with 75.5% of the population identifying as such according to the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020.\n\n## Economy\n\nAs of 2024, Texas had a gross state product (GSP) of $2.664 trillion, the second highest in the U.S. Its GSP is greater than the GDP of Brazil, the world's 8th-largest economy. The state ranks 22nd among U.S. states with a median household income of $64,034, while the poverty rate is 14.2%, making Texas the state with 14th highest poverty rate (compared to 13.15% nationally). Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California.\n\n## Taxation\n\nTexas has a reputation for a low tax. According to the Tax Foundation, Texans' state and local tax burdens are seventh-lowest nationally; state and local taxes cost $3,580 per capita, or 8.4 percent of resident incomes. Texas is one of seven states that lack a state income tax.\n\n## Agriculture and mining\n\nTexas has the most farms and the highest acreage in the United States. The state is ranked No. 1 for revenue generated from total livestock and livestock products. It is ranked No. 2 for total agricultural revenue, behind California. At $7.4 billion or 56.7 percent of Texas's annual agricultural cash receipts, beef cattle production represents the largest single segment of Texas agriculture. This is followed by cotton at $1.9 billion (14.6 percent), greenhouse/nursery at $1.5 billion (11.4 percent), broiler chickens at $1.3 billion (10 percent), and dairy products at $947 million (7.3 percent).\n\n## Energy\n\nEver since the discovery of oil at Spindletop, energy has been a dominant force politically and economically within the state. If Texas were its own country, it would be the sixth-largest oil producer in the world according to a 2014 study.\n\n## Technology\n\nWith large universities systems coupled with initiatives like the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, a wide array of different high-tech industries have developed in Texas. The Austin area is nicknamed the \"Silicon Hills\" and the north Dallas area the \"Silicon Prairie.\" Many high-tech companies are located in or have their headquarters in Texas (and Austin in particular), including Dell, Inc., Borland, Forcepoint, Indeed.com, Texas Instruments, Perot Systems, Rackspace and AT&T.\n\n## Commerce\n\nTexas's affluence stimulates a strong commercial sector consisting of retail, wholesale, banking and insurance, and construction industries. Examples of Fortune 500 companies not based on Texas traditional industries are AT&T, Kimberly-Clark, Blockbuster, J.C. Penney, Whole Foods Market, and Tenet Healthcare.\n\n## Culture\n\nHistorically, Texas culture comes from a blend of mostly Southern (Dixie), Western (frontier), and Southwestern (Mexican/Anglo fusion) influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. A popular food item, the breakfast burrito, draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a melting pot of cultures from around the world.\n\n## Texas self-perception\n\n\"Texas-sized\" describes something that is about the size of the U.S. state of Texas, or something (usually but not always originating from Texas) that is large compared to other objects of its type. Texas was the largest U.S. state until Alaska became a state in 1959. The phrase \"everything is bigger in Texas\" has been in regular use since at least 1950.\n\n## Arts\n\nHouston is one of only five American cities with permanent professional resident companies in all the major performing arts disciplines: the Houston Grand Opera, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Ballet, and The Alley Theatre. Known for the vibrancy of its visual and performing arts, the Houston Theater District ranks second in the country in the number of theater seats in a concentrated downtown area, with 12,948 seats for live performances and 1,480 movie seats. Founded in 1892, Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, also called \"The Modern\", is Texas's oldest art museum. Fort Worth also has the Kimbell Art Museum, the Amon Carter Museum, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame, the Will Rogers Memorial Center, and the Bass Performance Hall downtown. The Arts District of Downtown Dallas has arts venues such as the Dallas Museum of Art, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House, the Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art, and the Nasher Sculpture Center.\n\n## Sports\n\nWithin the \"Big Four\" professional leagues, Texas has two NFL teams (the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans), two MLB teams (the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers), three NBA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, the Houston Rockets, and the Dallas Mavericks), and one NHL team (the Dallas Stars). The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex is one of only thirteen American metropolitan areas that host sports teams from all the \"Big Four\" professional leagues. Outside of the \"Big Four\", Texas also has a WNBA team (the Dallas Wings), three Major League Soccer teams (Austin FC, Houston Dynamo FC, and FC Dallas), and one NWSL team (the Houston Dash).\n\n## Education\n\nThe second president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar, is the Father of Texas Education. During his term, the state set aside three leagues in each county for public schools. An additional 50 leagues of land set aside for the support of two universities would later become the basis of the state's Permanent University Fund. Lamar's actions set the foundation for a Texas-wide public school system.\n\n## Higher education\n\nThe state's two most widely recognized flagship universities are The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University, ranked as the 21st and 41st best universities in the nation according to 2020's latest Center for World University Rankings report, respectively. Some observers also include the University of Houston and Texas Tech University as tier one flagships alongside UT Austin and A&M. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ranks the state's public universities into three distinct tiers.\n\n## Healthcare\n\nNotwithstanding the concentration of elite medical centers in the state, The Commonwealth Fund ranks the Texas healthcare system the third worst in the nation. Texas ranks close to last in access to healthcare, quality of care, avoidable hospital spending, and equity. In May 2006, Texas initiated the program \"code red\" in response to the report the state had 25.1 percent of the population without health insurance, the largest proportion in the nation.\n\n## Medical research\n\nTexas has many elite research medical centers. The state has 15 medical schools, four dental schools, and two optometry schools. Texas has two Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories: one at The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, and the other at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio—the first privately owned BSL-4 lab in the United States.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe state's large size and rough terrain have historically complicated transportation. Texas has compensated by building the nation's largest highway and railway systems. The regulatory authority, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), maintains the state's highway system, regulates aviation, and public transportation systems.\n\n## Highways\n\nThe first Texas freeway was the Gulf Freeway opened in 1948 in Houston. As of 2005, 79,535 miles (127,999 km) of public highway crisscrossed Texas (up from 71,000 miles or 114,000 km in 1984). To fund recent growth in the state highways, Texas has 17 toll roads with several additional tollways proposed. In Central Texas, the southern section of the State Highway 130 toll road has a speed limit of 85 miles per hour (137 km/h), the highest in the nation. All federal and state highways in Texas are paved.\n\n## Airports\n\nTexas has 730 airports, second-most of any state in the nation. Largest in Texas by size and passengers served, Dallas/Fort Worth", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Texas\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Texas, based on the Caddo word táy:shaʼ (/tə́jːʃaʔ/) 'friend', was applied, in the spelling Tejas or Texas, [19] [20] [21] [1] by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy [22]\n\n\nHistory\nTexas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas Archaeologists have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact These were: [28] the Ancestral Puebloans from the upper Rio Grande region, centered west of Texas; the Mississippian culture, also known as Mound Builders, which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas; and the civilizations of Mesoamerica, which were centered south of Texas Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\n\nPrecontact era\nTexas lies between two major cultural spheres of Pre-Columbian North America: the Southwestern and the Plains areas Archaeologists have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact These were: [28] the Ancestral Puebloans from the upper Rio Grande region, centered west of Texas; the Mississippian culture, also known as Mound Builders, which extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas; and the civilizations of Mesoamerica, which were centered south of Texas Influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\n\nColonization\nThe first historical document related to Texas was a map of the Gulf Coast, created in 1519 by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda [41] Nine years later, shipwrecked Spanish explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his cohort became the first Europeans in what is now Texas [42] [43] Cabeza de Vaca reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in the area, \"half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us.\" [44] Cabeza de Vaca also made observations about the way of life of the Ignaces Natives of Texas [c] [46] Francisco Vázquez de Coronado described another encounter with native people in 1541 [d] [48]\n\n\nRepublic\nWithin Mexico, tensions continued between federalists and centralists In early 1835, wary Texians formed Committees of Correspondence and Safety [82] The unrest erupted into armed conflict in late 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales [83] This launched the Texas Revolution Texians elected delegates to the Consultation, which created a provisional government [84] The provisional government soon collapsed from infighting, and Texas was without clear governance for the first two months of 1836 [85]\n\n\nStatehood\nTexas was finally annexed when the expansionist James K Polk won the election of 1844 [97] On December 29, 1845, the U.S Congress admitted Texas to the U.S [98]\nAfter Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River leaving the Rio Grande Valley under contested Texan sovereignty [98] While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846 A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas [99]\n\n\nCivil War to late 19th century\nTexas re-entered war following the election of 1860 During this time, Black people comprised 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved [103] When Abraham Lincoln was elected, South Carolina seceded from the Union; five other Deep South states quickly followed A state convention considering secession opened in Austin on January 28, 1861 On February 1, by a vote of 166–8, the convention adopted an Ordinance of Secession Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861 Texas joined the newly created Confederate States of America on March 4, 1861, ratifying the permanent C.S Constitution on March 23 [1] [104]\n\n\nEarly to mid-20th century\nIn 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S history during the Galveston hurricane [116] On January 10, 1901, the first major oil well in Texas, Spindletop, was found south of Beaumont Other fields were later discovered nearby in East Texas, West Texas, and under the Gulf of Mexico The resulting \"oil boom\" transformed Texas [117] Oil production averaged three million barrels per day at its peak in 1972 [118]\n\n\nMid-20th to early 21st century\nBeginning around the mid-20th century, Texas began to transform from a rural and agricultural state to one urban and industrialized [129] The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state [129] As a part of the Sun Belt, Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s [129] Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry [129] By 1990, Hispanics and Latino Americans overtook Blacks to become the largest minority group [129] Texas has the largest Black population with over 3.9 million [130]\n\n\nGeography\nTexas is the second-largest U.S state by area, after Alaska, and the largest state within the contiguous United States, at 268,820 square miles (696,200 km2) If it were an independent country, Texas would be the 39th-largest [153] It ranks 26th worldwide amongst country subdivisions by size.\n\n\nGeology\nTexas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico The continental crust forms a stable Mesoproterozoic craton which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true oceanic crust of the Gulf of Mexico The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600 million years old [161]\n\n\nWildlife\nTexas is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the American green tree frog, and the greatest diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all [166] At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas [167]\n\n\nClimate\nThe large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple climate zones gives the state highly variable weather The Panhandle of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages 8.7 inches (220 mm) of annual rainfall, [171] while parts of southeast Texas average as much as 64 inches (1,600 mm) per year [172] Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate 37 inches (940 mm) per year [173]\n\n\nStorms\nThunderstorms strike Texas often, especially the eastern and northern portions of the state Tornado Alley covers the northern section of Texas The state experiences the most tornadoes in the United States, an average of 139 a year These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle [178] Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June [179]\n\n\nGreenhouse gases\nAs of 2017 [update], Texas emitted the most greenhouse gases in the U.S [188] As of 2017 [update] the state emits about 1,600 billion pounds (707 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide annually [188] As an independent state, Texas would rank as the world's seventh-largest producer of greenhouse gases [189] Causes of the state's vast greenhouse gas emissions include the state's large number of coal power plants and the state's refining and manufacturing industries [189] In 2010, there were 2,553 \"emission events\" which poured 44.6 million pounds (20,200 metric tons) of contaminants into the Texas sky [190]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas [195] These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States As of 2020, six Texas cities had populations greater than 600,000 Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso are among the 20 largest U.S cities Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million: Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, Houston–Sugar Land–The Woodlands, San Antonio–New Braunfels, and Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos The Dallas–Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas number about 7.5 million and 7 million residents as of 2019, respectively [196]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe resident population of Texas was 29,145,505 in the 2020 census, a 15.9% increase since the 2010 census [210] [211] At the 2020 census, the apportioned population of Texas stood at 29,183,290 [212] The 2023 Texas Population Estimate program estimated the population was 30,503,301 on July 1, 2023 [213] In 2010, Texas had a census population of 25,145,561 [214] Texas is the second-most populous state in the United States after California and the only other U.S state to surpass a total estimated population of 30 million people as of July 2, 2022 [215] [216]\n\n\nRace and ethnicity\nIn 2019, non-Hispanic Whites represented 41.2% of Texas's population, reflecting a national demographic shift [225] [226] [227] Black people made up 12.9%, American Indians and Alaska Natives 1.0%, Asian Americans 5.2%, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 0.1%, some other race 0.2%, and two or more races 1.8% Hispanics or Latino Americans of any race made up 39.7% of the estimated population [228]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe most common accent or dialect spoken by natives throughout Texas is sometimes referred to as Texan English, itself a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English [240] [241] Creole language is spoken in some parts of East Texas [242] In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities—Western American English and General American English, is increasingly

economy [260] The state ranks 22nd among U.S states with a median household income of $64,034, while the poverty rate is 14.2%, making Texas the state with 14th highest poverty rate (compared to 13.15% nationally) Texas's economy is the second-largest of any country subdivision globally, behind California.\n\n\nTaxation\nTexas has a reputation for a low tax [266] According to the Tax

needed] To fund recent growth in the state highways, Texas has 17 toll roads with several additional tollways proposed [404] In Central Texas, the southern section of the State Highway 130 toll road has a speed limit of 85 miles per hour (137 km/h), the highest in the nation [405] All federal and state highways in Texas are paved.\n\n\nAirports\nTexas has 730 airports, second-most of any state in the nation Largest in Texas by size and passengers served, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is the second-largest by area in the United States, and fourth in the world with 18,076 acres

The team's early years were marked by fluctuating fortunes, with the club experiencing periods of success and failure. In 1901, Milan won its first Serie A title, which was the Italian football league at the time.

Massimo Guantini [83] [84]\n\n\nStadiums\nMilan played their first matches at the Trotter pitch, located where  the Milan Central railway station would later be built It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities In 1903, Milan moved to the Acquabella pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose Milan played there until 1905 The following year the club moved to the Porta Monforte pitch, where they played until 1914 The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands In the following years Milan played at the Velodromo Sempione from 1914 to 1920, and at the Viale Lombardia stadium from 1920 to 1926 The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team [85]\n\n\nSupporters\nMilan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper La Repubblica [90] Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working class, which granted them the nickname of casciavid  [kaʃaˈʋiːt] (which in Milanese dialect means \"screwdrivers\"), used until the 1960s [91] On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class [91] The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, originated in Milan [92] Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere [92] Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference, [92] but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing [93] until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view [94]\n\n\nClub rivalries\nMilan's main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1 [97] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez for Inter The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder [98]\n\n\nPopular culture\nIn the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the Rossoneri team is Sunday Heroes (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the entire Gre-No-Li trio [citation needed]\n\n\nMilan TV\nOn 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, Milan Channel was launched The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of Milan TV, renewing its graphics and logo [citation needed]\n\n\nForza Milan!\nIn the editorial field, Forza Milan! was the official magazine of the club for over half a century It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018 [102]\n\n\nHonours\nWith a total of 31 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022 Milan's tenth scudetto win meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this.\n\n\nClub statistics and records\nPaolo Maldini holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches), [104] the latter being an all-time Serie A record [105]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players

positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver [169] In the

{"title": "Louis_Farrakhan", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nFarrakhan, who is Black, [15] was born Louis Eugene Walcott on May 11, 1933 in The Bronx, New York City [1] He is the younger of two sons of Sarah Mae Manning (1900–1988) and Percival Clark, immigrants from the Anglo-Caribbean islands His mother was born in Saint Kitts, while his father was Jamaican The couple separated before their second son was born, and Walcott says he never knew his biological father [16] Walcott was named after Louis Walcott, a man with whom his mother had a relationship after becoming separated from Percival Clark [1] In a 1996 interview with Henry Louis Gates Jr., Walcott speculated that Percival Clark, \"a light-skinned man with straight hair from Jamaica\", may have been Jewish [17] [18]\n\n\nMusic career\nIn the 1950s, Walcott began his professional music career as a singer billed as \"The Charmer\" It was during a tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that he took this nickname [23] At this point, earning $500 a week, Walcott was touring the northeastern and midwestern United States, sometimes also using the nickname \"Calypso Gene\" [24] In 1953–1954, preceding Harry Belafonte's success with his album Calypso (released in 1956), he recorded and released a dozen cheeky, funny tunes as \"The Charmer\" in a mixed mento/calypso style, including \"Ugly Woman\", \"Stone Cold Man\" and calypso standards like \"Zombie Jamboree\", \"Hol 'Em Joe\", \"Mary Ann\" and \"Brown Skin Girl\" Some were reissued: \"Don't Touch Me Nylon\" has mild, explicit sexual lyrics as well as \"Female Boxer\", which contains some sexist overtones [25] and \"Is She Is, Or Is She Ain't\" (inspired by Christine Jorgensen's sex change operation) [26]\n\n\nNation of Islam\nIn February 1955, Walcott was headlining a show in Chicago, Illinois, called Calypso Follies There he first came in contact with the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI) through Rodney Smith, a friend and saxophonist from Boston Walcott and his wife Betsy were invited to the Nation of Islam's annual Saviours' Day address by Elijah Muhammad Prior to going to Saviours' Day, due to then-Minister Malcolm X's media presence, Walcott had never heard of Elijah Muhammad, and like many outside of the Nation of Islam, he thought that Malcolm X was the leader of the Nation of Islam [30]\n\n\nEarly ministry roles (1956–1980)\nAfter nine months of being a registered Muslim in the NOI and a member of Muhammad's Temple of Islam in Boston, where Malcolm X was the minister, Farrakhan became his assistant minister Eventually he became the official minister after Elijah Muhammad transferred Malcolm X to Muhammad's Temple of Islam No 7 on West 116th St in Harlem, New York City Louis X continued to be mentored by Malcolm X until the latter's assassination in 1965 [citation needed] After Malcolm X's death, Elijah Muhammad appointed Farrakhan to the two prominent positions that Malcolm held before being dismissed from the NOI Farrakhan became the national spokesman/national representative of the NOI and was appointed minister of the influential Harlem Mosque (Temple), where he served until 1975 [15]\n\n\nAssassination of Malcolm X and aftermath\nThe day that Malcolm X was assassinated in Harlem, Farrakhan happened to be in Newark, New Jersey, on rotation, 45 minutes away from where Malcolm X was assassinated [15]\n\n\nLeadership of Nation of Islam (1981–present)\nIn 1981, Farrakhan and his supporters held their first Saviours' Day convention in Chicago, Illinois, and took back the name of the Nation of Islam The event was similar to the earlier Nation's celebrations, last held in Chicago on February 26, 1975 At the convention's keynote address, Farrakhan announced his attempt to restore the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad's teachings [50] [unreliable source?]\n\n\nMillion Man March\nIn October 1995, Farrakhan convened a broad coalition of what he and his supporters claimed was one million men in Washington, D.C., for the Million Man March The count however fell far below the hoped-for numbers The National Park Service estimated that approximately 440,000 were in attendance [54] Farrakhan threatened to sue the National Park Service because of the low estimate from the Park Police [55]\n\n\nSuccession\nIt is unknown who will lead the Nation of Islam after Farrakhan's death Ishmael Muhammad has been speculated to be a potential successor [58] [59] Before 1993, Khallid Muhammad was \"the most likely heir apparent\" [60]\n\n\nViews\nFarrakhan has been the center of much controversy with critics saying that his political views and comments are antisemitic or racist [61] Farrakhan has categorically denied these charges [62] and stated that much of America's perception of him has been shaped by the media [63] [64] His critics have labeled him a cult leader [65] [66] [67]\n\n\nRacism and black nationalism\nThe Anti-Defamation League classifies Farrakhan as a racist, [68] and the Southern Poverty Law Center considers the Nation of Islam (NOI) as a hate group and a black nationalist organization [69] According to the SPLC, the NOI asserts that black people are racially superior to white people [69] and promotes a \"fundamentally anti-white theology\" [70] amounting to an \"innate black superiority over whites\" [69] According to the NOI, whites were created 6,600 years ago as a \"race of devils\" by an evil scientist named Yakub, [70] a story which originated with the founder of the NOI, Wallace D Fard [69]\n\n\nAntisemitism\nBoth the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center consider Farrakhan an antisemite Farrakhan has accused Jews of controlling large sections of the media, the US government and the global economy, regularly referring to these Jews as \"Satanic\" He has repeatedly described Adolf Hitler as a \"great man\" and claimed Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws and black oppression in general [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nHurricane Katrina\nIn comments in 2005, Farrakhan stated that there was a 25-foot (7.6 m) hole under one of the key levees that failed in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina He implied that the levee's destruction was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the population of the largely black sections within the city Farrakhan later said that New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin told him of the crater during a meeting in Dallas, Texas [95]\n\n\nBarack Obama\nIn 2008, Farrakhan publicly criticized the United States and supported then-Senator Barack Obama who was campaigning at the time to become the president of the United States of America [100] [101] Farrakhan and Obama had met at least once before that time [102] [103]\n\n\nDianetics\nA connection between the Church of Scientology and the Nation of Islam is reported to date from the late 1990s when Farrakhan was introduced to its teachings by the musician Isaac Hayes, who was the Church of Scientology's International spokesman for its World Literacy Crusade [106]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nDuring the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Farrakhan praised Republican candidate Donald Trump as the only candidate \"who has stood in front of the Jewish community and said 'I don't want your money.'\" While he declined to endorse Trump outright, he said of Trump, \"I like what I'm looking at.\" [110] In 2018, Farrakhan again praised Trump for \"destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise\" He included the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in this group [111]\n\n\nWomen and allegations of sexism\nFarrakhan received sexual discrimination complaints filed with a New York state agency when he banned women from attending a speech he gave in a city-owned theater in 1993 [114] The next year he gave a speech only women could attend [114] In his speech for women, as The New York Times reported,\n\n\nRelationship with Muammar Gaddafi\nIn 1985, Farrakhan obtained working capital in the amount of $5 million, in the form of an interest-free loan from Libya's Islamic Call Society to be repaid within 18 months which was to be used to create a toiletries firm with black employees [115] Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had also offered Farrahkan guns to begin a black nation Farrakhan said that he told Gaddafi that he preferred an economic investment in black America [116]\n\n\nSocial media\nFarrakhan lost his verified status on his Twitter posts in June 2018, denying him full verification, after asserting the Harvey Weinstein scandal was about \"Jewish power\" [121] A contributor to the Tablet website, Yair Rosenberg, objected to a potential suspension on the grounds that \"erasing hate from social media doesn't make it go away, it just makes it easier to ignore\": allowing such accounts to continue to have a social media presence makes them more difficult to dismiss as \"inconsequential\" [122] The following October, Twitter said that it would not suspend Farrakhan's account after he posted a tweet that compared Jews to termites: Twitter substantiated its inaction by stating that he had not broken the site's rules [123] After a Twitter rule change on hateful conduct in July 2019, the tweet—\"I'm not an anti-Semite I'm anti-Termite\"—was removed [124]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFarrakhan has been married to Khadijah Farrakhan since 1953 [21] He is the father of nine children and the grandfather of basketball player Mustapha Farrakhan Jr [1] [22] Farrakhan's eldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr., died on June 2, 2018 [128]\n\n\nFamily\nFarrakhan has been married to Khadijah Farrakhan since 1953 [21] He is the father of nine children and the grandfather of basketball player Mustapha Farrakhan Jr [1] [22] Farrakhan's eldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr., died on June 2, 2018 [128]\n\n\nHealth\nFarrakhan announced that he was seriously ill in a letter on September 11, 2006 The letter was directed to his staff, the Nation of Islam members, and supporters The letter, published in The Final Call newspaper, said that doctors in Cuba had discovered a peptic ulcer According to the letter, Farrakhan lost 35 pounds (16 kg) due to subsequent infections, and he urged the Nation of Islam leadership to carry on while he recovered

and claimed Jewish involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, Jim Crow laws and black oppression in general [73] [74] [75]\n\n\nHurricane Katrina\nIn comments in 2005, Farrakhan stated that there was a 25-foot (7.6 m) hole under one of the key levees that failed in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina He implied that the levee's destruction was a deliberate attempt to wipe out the population of the largely black sections within the city Farrakhan later said that New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin told him of the crater during a meeting in Dallas, Texas [95]\n\n\nBarack Obama\nIn 2008, Farrakhan publicly criticized the United States and supported then-Senator Barack Obama who was campaigning at the time to become the president of the United States of America [100] [101] Farrakhan and Obama had met at least once before that time [102] [103]\n\n\nDianetics\nA connection between the Church of Scientology and the Nation of Islam is reported to date from the late 1990s when Farrakhan was introduced to its teachings by the musician Isaac Hayes, who was the Church of Scientology's International spokesman for its World Literacy Crusade [106]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nDuring the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Farrakhan praised Republican candidate Donald Trump as the only candidate \"who has stood in front of the Jewish community and said 'I don't want your money.'\" While he declined to endorse Trump outright, he said of Trump, \"I like what I'm looking at.\" [110] In 2018, Farrakhan again praised Trump for \"destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise\" He included the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in this group [111]\n\n\nWomen and allegations of sexism\nFarrakhan received sexual discrimination complaints filed with a New York state agency when he banned women from attending a speech he gave in a city-owned theater in 1993 [114] The next year he gave a speech only women could attend [114] In his speech for women, as The New York Times reported,\n\n\nRelationship with Muammar Gaddafi\nIn 1985, Farrakhan obtained working capital in the amount of $5 million, in the form of an interest-free loan from Libya's Islamic Call Society to be repaid within 18 months which was to be used to create a toiletries firm with black employees [115] Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had also offered Farrahkan guns to begin a black nation Farrakhan said that he told Gaddafi that he preferred an economic investment in black America [116]\n\n\nSocial media\nFarrakhan lost his verified status on his Twitter posts in June 2018, denying him full verification, after asserting the Harvey Weinstein scandal was about \"Jewish power\" [121] A contributor to the Tablet website, Yair Rosenberg, objected to a potential suspension on the grounds that \"erasing hate from social media doesn't make it go away, it just makes it easier to ignore\": allowing such accounts to continue to have a social media presence makes them more difficult to dismiss as \"inconsequential\" [122] The following October, Twitter said that it would not suspend Farrakhan's account after he posted a tweet that compared Jews to termites: Twitter substantiated its inaction by stating that he had not broken the site's rules [123] After a Twitter rule change on hateful conduct in July 2019, the tweet—\"I'm not an anti-Semite I'm anti-Termite\"—was removed [124]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFarrakhan has been married to Khadijah Farrakhan since 1953 [21] He is the father of nine children and the grandfather of basketball player Mustapha Farrakhan Jr [1] [22] Farrakhan's eldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr., died on June 2, 2018 [128]\n\n\nFamily\nFarrakhan has been married to Khadijah Farrakhan since 1953 [21] He is the father of nine children and the grandfather of basketball player Mustapha Farrakhan Jr [1] [22] Farrakhan's eldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr., died on June 2, 2018 [128]\n\n\nHealth\nFarrakhan announced that he was seriously ill in a letter on September 11, 2006 The letter was directed to his staff, the Nation of Islam members, and supporters The letter, published in The Final Call newspaper, said that doctors in Cuba had discovered a peptic ulcer According to the letter, Farrakhan lost 35 pounds (16 kg) due to subsequent infections, and he urged the Nation of Islam leadership to carry on while he recovered [129]\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Spider-Man", "content": "\nPublication history\nIn 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify [15]: 1  As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to \"get out of his system\" what he felt was missing in comic books [16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence, [14]: 130  [17] and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true [note 1] Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a \"sixth sense\", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's \"spider-sense\" [17] Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with \"boy\", Lee says he chose \"Spider-Man\" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and felt the name \"Spider-Boy\" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes [18] He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume that starts with an \"S\" and ends with \"man\" [19] (although artist Steve Ditko intended the character to have an orange and purple costume) [20] At that time, Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections [note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for issue #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962) [21] In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man [18] While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that \"The Spider-Man .. will appear every month in Amazing.\" [21]

[22]\n\n\nCommercial success\nA few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics [34]: 97  A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963) The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series [8]: 211  with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was \"beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence In short, he is one of us.\" [8]: 223  Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita Sr replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for the next several years In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers It lasted for two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' summer Annuals that began in 1964 [35]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nIn Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, [49] Midtown High School student Peter

Amazing Spider-Man #252 The change to a longstanding character's design met with controversy, \"with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C rivals Superman and Batman.\" [71] The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle, [72] though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge [54] Peter proposes to Mary Jane in The Amazing Spider-Man #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later,

Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience.\"\n\n\nPowers, skills, and equipment\nPeter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider [112] Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force, [113] though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider's feet Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength, agility, and balance and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his \"spider-sense\", which alerts him to danger [112]\n\n\nOther versions\n Original depiction \n\n\nSky-Spider\nIn Marvel Comics Universe 2410, a boy named Petor was about to be born to a mother named Mari and a father named Rikkar, when suddenly an evil witch came to their village and contaminated the water well with her blood Therefore, all the children of that village were born as mutants and monsters and were killed at birth But Petor's mother did not want to kill him and raised him in the forest (without her husband knowing) 15 years later, the village was attacked by invaders called the Creons, so Petor came to the village to defend it He managed to defeat the attackers, but he lost his mother and his father did not recognize him, and as a result, he was once again rejected from the village.\n\n\nSpider-Man from Earth-93165\nThis Spider-Man was seen in What If...?

what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a \"nerdy high school student\" [184]: 5  Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included \"heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama\" Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: \"the flawed superhero with everyday problems\" This idea spawned a comics revolution [184]: 6  The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books, such as The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them [185] After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as May Parker's residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero [186]\n\n\nReception\nThe culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of Thor He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he's more relatable than playboy billionaire Iron Man And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like Captain America Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.\n\n\nReal-life comparisons\nReal-life people who have been compared to Spider-Man for their climbing feats include:\n\n\nIn other media\nSpider-Man has appeared in comics, cartoons, films, video games, coloring books, novels, records, children's books, and theme park rides [187] On television, he first starred in the ABC animated series Spider-Man (1967–1970), [213] Spidey Super Stories (1974–1977) on PBS, and the CBS live-action series The Amazing Spider-Man (1978–1979), starring Nicholas Hammond Other animated series featuring the superhero include the syndicated Spider-Man (1981–1982), Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981–1983), Fox Kids' Spider-Man (1994–1998), Spider-Man Unlimited (1999–2000), Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003), The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008–2009), Ultimate Spider-Man (2012–2017), [214] Disney XD's Spider-Man (2017–2020), and Spidey and His Amazing Friends (2021–present).\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Spider-Man**\n\nSpider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in the anthology comic book \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15 (August 1962) published by Marvel Comics. Spider-Man is one of the most iconic and beloved superheroes in the world, known for his red and blue costume, his web-slinging abilities, and his struggle to balance superhero life with personal life.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. Stan Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to \"get out of his system\" what he felt was missing in comic books. Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall. The name \"Spider-Man\" was chosen because Lee wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and felt the name \"Spider-Boy\" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. Lee also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman.\n\n**Creation and Development**\n\nStan Lee and Steve Ditko were instrumental in creating the character of Spider-Man. Lee wrote the script for the first appearance of Spider-Man in \"Amazing Fantasy\" #15, while Ditko provided the artwork. The character was initially conceived as a teenage superhero who gained his powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Peter Parker, the alter ego of Spider-Man, is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He becomes a crime-fighter after his Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar that he could have stopped earlier.\n\n**Commercial Success**\n\nA few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Martin Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics. A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series, with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon. A 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nPeter Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. He is a Midtown High School student who gains superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a science exhibit. Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings through the use of webbing of his own design. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as \"Spider-Man\", becomes a novelty television star. However, he blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, and his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nIn the early years of the series, Spider-Man's rogues gallery is established, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and the Vulture. The Green Goblin is one of Spider-Man's most iconic foes, and is the first supervillain to be introduced in the series.

The new costume meets with controversy, with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege. The creators then reveal that the costume is an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle.\n\n**1990s**\n\nIn the 1990s, the series undergoes a significant change, with the introduction of a new creative team and a new direction for the character.

and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a \"sixth sense\", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's \"spider-sense\" [17] Although at the time teenage superheroes were

(June 1973), [54] the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text) [63] [64] She dies during Spider-Man's rescue attempt, and Spider-Man swears revenge against his nemesis; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: \"It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her.\" [65] The following issue, Spider-Man vengefully attacks and overpowers the Green Goblin, who kills himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man [66]\n\n\n1980s\nFrom 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest The new costume originated in the Secret Wars miniseries on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth's major superheroes and supervillains [70] He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in The Amazing Spider-Man #252 The change to a longstanding character's design met with controversy, \"with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C rivals Superman and Batman.\" [71] The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle, [72] though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge [54] Peter proposes to Mary Jane in The Amazing Spider-Man #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding taking place in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 (1987)—promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at Shea Stadium, with Stan Lee officiating, on June 5, 1987 [73] David Michelinie, who scripted based on a plot by editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, said in 2007, \"I didn't think they actually should  [have gotten] married .. I had actually planned another version, one that wasn't used.\" [73] Peter publishes a book of Spider-Man photographs called Webs, [74] and returns to his Empire State University graduate studies in biochemistry in #310 (Dec 1988) [54]\n\n\n1990s\nIn the controversial [75] 1990s storyline the \"Clone Saga\", a clone of Parker, created in 1970s comics by insane scientist Miles Warren, a.k.a the Jackal, returns to New York City upon hearing of Aunt May's health worsening The clone had lived incognito as Ben Reilly, but now assumes the superhero guise the Scarlet Spider and allies with Parker To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone [76] Complicating matters, Mary Jane announces in The Spectacular Spider-Man #220 (Jan 1995) that she is pregnant with Peter's baby [54] Later, however, a resurrected Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) has Mary Jane poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her and Peter's unborn daughter [77] It is later revealed that The Green Goblin switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Peter's life by making him believe himself to be the clone Ben is killed while saving Peter, in Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 (Dec 1996), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Ben was the clone [77]\n\n\n2000s\nBabylon 5 creator J Michael Straczynski began writing The Amazing Spider-Man, illustrated by John Romita Jr., beginning with volume 2, #30 (#471, June 2001) Two issues later, Peter, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets the enigmatic Ezekiel Sims, who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Peter, having gained such abilities, might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a totemic spider spirit In vol 2, #37 (#478, Jan 2002), Aunt May discovers her nephew is Spider-Man [80] Peter and Mary Jane reconcile in (vol 2) #50 (#491, April 2003), [80] and in #512 (Nov 2004)—the original issue numbering having returned with #500—Parker learns his late girlfriend Gwen Stacy had had two children with Norman Osborn [83]\n\n\n2010s\nAt Loki's suggestion, Norman Osborn creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming the world poses a national security threat He is defeated, and ends up incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary [92] [93] A conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus over Osborn's son ends when it is revealed the child's father is Harry, who leaves town to raise him [94] One of Doctor Octopus' Octobots swaps his and Spider-Man's personality, causing Peter to become trapped in the Doctor's dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter's life for himself Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he manages to establish a weak link with the Doctor's mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories; Otto understands Peter's ideals of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a \"Superior\" Spider-Man [95] [96]\n\n\n2020s\nKindred uses the resurrected Sin-Eater's sins to possess Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman, Anya Corazon, and Julia Carpenter Doctor Strange, who manages to restrain a possessed Silk, agrees to help Spider-Man However, Peter dies when fighting Kindred While dead, Peter's consciousness remembers the fateful day of the start of One More Day; Kindred is willing to resurrect Peter [109]\n\n\nPersonality and themes\n\"People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera What Lee and Ditko actually did in The Amazing Spider-Man was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character's life Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this month's bad guys.. Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience.\"\n\n\nPowers, skills, and equipment\nPeter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider [112] Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force, [113] though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider's feet Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength, agility, and balance and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his \"spider-sense\", which alerts him to danger [112]\n\n\nOther versions\n Original depiction \n\n\nSky-Spider\nIn Marvel Comics Universe 2410, a boy named Petor was about to be born to a mother named Mari and a father named Rikkar, when suddenly an evil witch came to their village and contaminated the water well with her blood Therefore, all the children of that village were born as mutants and monsters and were killed at birth But Petor's mother did not want to kill him and raised him in the forest (without her husband knowing) 15 years later, the village was attacked by invaders called the Creons, so Petor came to the village to defend it He managed to defeat the attackers, but he lost his mother and his father did not recognize him, and as a result, he was once again rejected from the village.\n\n\nSpider-Man from Earth-93165\nThis Spider-Man was seen in What If...? V1 55, titled \"What If.. The Avengers Lost Operation Galactic Storm?\"  In fact, \"Operation Galactic Storm\" was one of the most important and controversial events of Marvel, which was published in 1992 In this event, the Avengers get involved in a war between two alien races, the Kree and the Shi'ar In this story, the Shi'ar detonate a bomb that kills millions of Kree Then the Avengers realize that everything is under the supervision of a being called the Supreme Intelligence They decide to execute him Captain America strongly opposes this act This controversial decision was unprecedented in the world of comics at that time The Avengers manage to stop the killing of the Kree, but surprisingly, instead of thanking the Avengers, they attack and destroy Earth In a panel, we see that Spider-Man takes the body of his wife, Mary Jane, and then everything is destroyed.\n\n\nSupporting cast\nSpider-Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker, and his uncle and father figure, Ben Parker After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt May is virtually Peter's only family, and she and Peter are very close [50]\n\n\nEnemies\nWriters and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man, in comics and in other media As with Spider-Man, the majority of the villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers [note 6] The following Spider-Man villains are listed in the ordering of their original chronological appearance:\n\n\nRomantic interests\nPeter Parker's romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student Liz Allan, [52] to having his first date with Betty Brant, [174] secretary to the Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J Jonah Jameson After his breakup with Betty Brant, Peter eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy, [54] [57] daughter of New York City Police Department detective Captain George Stacy, both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of Spider-Man [62] Mary Jane Watson became Peter's best friend and eventually his wife [73] Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat, is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider-Man's sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point [69]\n\n\nChildren\nOver the course of the comics, Peter Parker had several biological children across different continuities, usually with Mary Jane Watson, including Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker) and Benjy Parker from the MC2 universe, and Spiderling (Annie Parker) from Earth-18119 [175] [176]\n\n\nAlternate versions of Spider-Man\nWithin the Marvel Universe, there exists a multiverse with many variations of Spider-Man [177] An early character included in the 1980s is the fictional anthropomorphic animal parody of Spider-Man as a pig named Spider-Ham (Peter Porker) [178] Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the futuristic version of Spider-Man in Marvel 2099 named Miguel O'Hara In the Marvel Comics 2 imprint, Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named Mayday Parker, who carries on Spider-Man's legacy, while Marvel Noir has a 1930s version of Peter Parker [177] [179] [180] Other themed versions exist within the early 2000s, such as a Marvel Mangaverse version and an Indian version from Spider-Man: India, Pavitr Prabhakar [177] [181]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn The Creation of Spider-Man, comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers \"nothing too original\"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a \"nerdy high school student\" [184]: 5  Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included \"heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama\" Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: \"the flawed superhero with everyday problems\" This idea spawned a comics revolution [184]: 6  The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early 1960s comic books, such as The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public's perception of them [185] After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as May Parker's residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero [186]\n\n\nReception\nThe culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes He's got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of Thor He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he's more relatable than playboy billionaire Iron Man And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like Captain America Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.\n\n\nReal-life comparisons\nReal-life people who have been compared to Spider-Man for their climbing feats include:\n\n\nIn other media\nSpider-Man has appeared in comics, cartoons, films, video games, coloring books, novels, records, children's books, and theme park rides [187] On television, he first starred in the ABC animated series Spider-Man (1967–1970), [213] Spidey Super Stories (1974–1977) on PBS, and the CBS live-action series The Amazing Spider-Man (1978–1979), starring Nicholas Hammond Other animated series featuring the superhero include the syndicated Spider-Man (1981–1982), Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981–1983), Fox Kids' Spider-Man (1994–1998), Spider-Man Unlimited (1999–2000), Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003), The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008–2009), Ultimate Spider-Man (2012–2017), [214] Disney XD's Spider-Man (2017–2020), and Spidey and His Amazing Friends (2021–present).\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

(1874−1886)\nAston Villa Football Club are believed to have formed on 21 November 1874, by members of the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth: which is now part of Birmingham [12] The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood, who were members of the chapel's cricket team looking for a way to stay fit during the winter months [13] Due to the lack of local football teams Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules Villa won their first game 1–0 [14]\n\n\nVictorian and Edwardian golden age (1886–1914)\nFollowing the professionalisation of football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager The following advert was placed in the Birmingham Daily Gazette newspaper in June 1886:\n\n\nRelative decline and first relegation (1920–1939)\nIn January 1920, Billy Walker scored twice on his Villa debut in a 2–1 FA Cup first-round win over QPR; the club won the FA Cup for the sixth time that season and Walker went on to establish himself as Villa's star player of the 1920s, scoring a record 244 goals in 531 appearances, captaining Villa and England George Ramsay retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement Billy Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, in reality several other football clubs had caught up with Aston Villa, most notably Arsenal, who the club finished runners-up to in the league in 1930–31 and 1932–33 Despite missing out on the league title, Villa Park crowds were entertained by attacking football, the 128 goals scored in 1930–31, remains the all-time top-flight record to the present day A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward Tom 'Pongo' Waring, with another 30 goals from winger Eric Houghton.\n\n\nMediocrity and discontent (1945–1961)\nLike all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end [33] Bumper crowds flocked to Villa Park following the war, 76,588 people attended the FA Cup quarter-final between Villa and Derby County in March 1946, which is the all-time record attendance at Villa Park The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s Star players of this era included the one-club man Harry Parkes, the Welsh centre forward Trevor Ford and inside-forward Johnny Dixon, however the club only achieved mid-table finishes throughout the forties and fifties, never finishing higher than 6th place in the league The board came in for increasing criticism during this time, with the 1953 AGM described by the Sports Argus as \"the longest and liveliest Villa meeting\" [34] Shareholders and supporters criticised the club's lack of youth development, recruitment and training methods When Danny Blanchflower put in a transfer request in 1954 he said that \"the club had grown fat and lazy on its old traditions and the decay was eating at the once solid foundations\" [35]\n\n\nDeep malaise and revival (1961–1974)\nHitchens' goals brought him to the attention of Italian club Inter Milan, who offered him a large financial incentive to sign He was sold for £85,000 in summer of 1961, his replacement, Derek Dougan was not a success and Villa slid backwards Mercer's forced retirement from the club in July 1964, following a stress-induced stroke, signalled a period of deep turmoil and malaise The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club's finances were in a parlous state This led to the club selling its top striker Tony Hateley to Chelsea for £100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967 The board even sold the club's training ground outside Villa Park for housing, leaving the team in the position of training on borrowed training pitches of local factory teams [38]\n\n\nBack among the elite (1974–1992)\nFollowing a 14th-place finish in the Second Division, Crowe was replaced in August 1974 by Ron Saunders He was a fitness fanatic, whose brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, by the end of season 1974–75, he had taken Aston Villa back into the First Division and into Europe [42] One player who had been a mainstay of the Villa team throughout the rollercoaster of relegations and subsequent revival was fan-favourite Charlie Aitkin, who made 659 appearances at left back for the club between 1959 and 1976, making him Villa's all-time record appearance holder.\n\n\n24 years in the Premier League (1992–2016)\nVilla were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League, along with Blackburn Rovers and Everton Villa finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season under manager Ron Atkinson His side lifted the League Cup in 1994, beating Manchester United 3–1 in the final, with goals from Dalian Atkinson and Dean Saunders, but the team struggled for form in the league and Atkinson was replaced by former Villa striker Brian Little in November 1994 Little assembled a young side which included players as Gareth Southgate, Steve Staunton, Ian Taylor and Dwight Yorke, leading the club to a fifth League Cup triumph in 1996, beating Leeds United 3–0 at Wembley Villa finished fourth in the league that season, and fifth the season after.\n\n\nChampionship to Champions League (2016–present)\nIn June 2016, Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought the club for £76 million [67] Former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo was appointed as the club's new manager, but was sacked after just 12 games following a poor start to the season [68] He was replaced by former Birmingham manager Steve Bruce [69] Bruce led the team to finish fourth in the 2017–18 season, but lost in the 2018 EFL Championship play-off final to Fulham.\n\n\nColours and badge\nThe club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim They were the original wearers of the claret and blue Villa's colours at the outset were royal blue caps and stockings, royal blue and scarlet \"striped\" (in the context of the time, hooped) jerseys, and white knickerbockers, one of the club rules including a provision that \"no member can take part in a match without wearing the above uniform\" [86] For a few years after that (1877–79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green By 1880, black jerseys with a Scottish Lion Rampant embroidered on the chest were introduced by Villa's Scottish leaders William McGregor and George Ramsay This remained the first choice strip for six years On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the club's official minute book states:\n\n\nKit manufacturers and sponsors\nTables of kit suppliers and shirt sponsors appear below: [85]\n\n\nStadium\nAston Villa's current home venue is Villa Park; the team previously played at Aston Park (1874–1876) and Wellington Road (1876–1897) Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005 Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries [99] Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals In 2022, the club announced plans to rebuild the North Stand and part of the Trinity Road stand, which will take the maximum capacity over 50,000 [100]\n\n\nOwnership\nThe first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s He was chairman and substantial shareholder of \"Aston Villa F.C.\" from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006 The club were floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation [103] In 2006, it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa [104]\n\n\nSocial responsibility\nAston Villa has a unique relationship with the Acorns Children's Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football [113] In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated the front of its kit shirts, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and more funds [114] Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club has paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations [115] [116]\n\n\nAston Villa Foundation\nIn 2016, Aston Villa created a registered charity, the Aston Villa Foundation [118] The aim of the charity is to deliver the social responsibility work of Aston Villa Working alongside key local and national stakeholders, the Foundation delivers projects such as football in the community, disability, health and wellbeing, education, interventions and community relations [119]\n\n\nSupporters and rivalries\nAston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the Midlands and beyond, with supporters' clubs all across the world Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98% white When Randy Lerner's regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve the support from ethnic minorities A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community, including Aston Pride [121] A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region [122] The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision-making process Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the board [123] In 2011, the club supported a supporter-based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park The song \"The Bells Are Ringing\" is to be played before games [124]\n\n\nStatistics\nThe 2024–25 campaign is Aston Villa's 111th season in the top tier of English football The only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with 122 seasons, [134] making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played fixture in English top-flight football Aston Villa were relegated from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in 1992–93, but were promoted back in 2018–19 They are ninth in the All-time FA Premier League table, and have the fifth highest total of major honours (20) won by an English club [135]\n\n\nHonours\nAston Villa Football Club have won European and domestic league honours The club's last English honour was in 1996 when they won the League Cup, and most recently they won the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n\n\nDomestic\nLeague\n\n\nEuropean\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA

successful captain, leading Villa to five league titles and two FA Cup triumphs during the club's 'Golden Age' Villa's longest-serving captain is George Cummings, who led the team from 1938 to 1949, albeit with the interruption of World War II in between The present captain is Scotland international John McGinn.\n\n\nNotable players\nThere have been many players who can be called notable

McGrath, Clem Stephenson and Peter Schmeichel (who would go on to play for Villa three seasons later) [161] Schmeichel was later inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2022, with former

The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price, and William Scattergood, who were members of the chapel's cricket team looking for a way to stay fit during the winter months. Due to the lack of local football teams, Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. Villa won their first game 1-0.\n\n## Victorian and Edwardian Golden Age (1886-1914)\n\nFollowing the professionalisation of football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager. The following advert was placed in the Birmingham Daily Gazette newspaper in June 1886: \"Aston Villa Football Club seeks a Manager. The club is prepared to offer a salary of £150 per annum, plus expenses. Applicants should be skilled in the art of football and have a good knowledge of the game.\" The club's fortunes changed dramatically under the management of George Ramsay, who was appointed in 1876. Ramsay was a skilled and experienced manager who had played for Aston Villa in the early years of the club. He was instrumental in developing the club's style of play and was known for his innovative tactics.\n\n## World War I and the Interwar Period (1914-1939)\n\nThe outbreak of World War I had a significant impact on Aston Villa. The club's players were called up to serve in the army, and many did not return. The club's fortunes declined during this period, and they were relegated to the Second Division in 1915. The club's management was also affected, with George Ramsay resigning in 1916. The club's fortunes improved during the interwar period, with the appointment of new managers and the emergence of new players.\n\n# Mediocrity and Discontent (1945-1961)\n\nLike all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end. Bumper crowds flocked to Villa Park following the war, 76,588 people attended the FA Cup quarter-final between Villa and Derby County in March 1946, which is the all-time record attendance at Villa Park. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Star players of this era included the one-club man Harry Parkes, the Welsh centre forward Trevor Ford, and inside-forward Johnny Dixon, however the club only achieved mid-table finishes throughout the forties and fifties, never finishing higher than 6th place in the league.\n\n## Deep Malaise and Revival (1961-1974)\n\nHitchens' goals brought him to the attention of Italian club Inter Milan, who offered him a large financial incentive to sign. He was sold for £85,000 in summer of 1961, his replacement, Derek Dougan was not a success, and Villa slid backwards. Mercer's forced retirement from the club in July 1964, following a stress-induced stroke, signalled a period of deep turmoil and malaise. The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure, and the club's finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker Tony Hateley to Chelsea for £100,000 in October 1966, without his goals, Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager Dick Taylor in 1967.\n\n## Back Among the Elite (1974-1992)\n\nFollowing a 14th-place finish in the Second Division, Crowe was replaced in August 1974 by Ron Saunders. He was a fitness fanatic, whose brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, by the end of season 1974-75, he had taken Aston Villa back into the First Division and into Europe. One player who had been a mainstay of the Villa team throughout the rollercoaster of relegations and subsequent revival was fan-favourite Charlie Aitkin, who made 659 appearances at left back for the club between 1959 and 1976, making him Villa's all-time record appearance holder.\n\n## 24 Years in the Premier League (1992-2016)\n\nVilla were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League, along with Blackburn Rovers and Everton. Villa finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season under manager Ron Atkinson. His side lifted the League Cup in 1994, beating Manchester United 3-1 in the final, with goals from Dalian Atkinson and Dean Saunders, but the team struggled for form in the league and Atkinson was replaced by former Villa striker Brian Little in November 1994. Little assembled a young side which included players as Gareth Southgate, Steve Staunton, Ian Taylor, and Dwight Yorke, leading the club to a fifth League Cup triumph in 1996, beating Leeds United 3-0 at Wembley.\n\n## Championship to Champions League (2016-Present)\n\nIn June 2016, Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought the club for £76 million. Former Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo was appointed as the club's new manager, but was sacked after just 12 games following a poor start to the season. He was replaced by former Birmingham manager Steve Bruce. Bruce led the team to finish fourth in the 2017-18 season, but lost in the 2018 EFL Championship play-off final to Fulham.\n\n# Colours and Badge\n\nThe club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. The colours were the original wearers of the claret and blue Villa's colours at the outset were royal blue caps and stockings, royal blue and scarlet \"striped\" (in the context of the time, hooped) jerseys, and white knickerbockers, one of the club rules including a provision that \"no member can take part in a match without wearing the above uniform\" for a few years after that (1877-79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a Scottish Lion Rampant embroidered on the chest were introduced by Villa's Scottish leaders William McGregor and George Ramsay. This remained the first choice strip for six years.\n\n# Kit Manufacturers and Sponsors\n\nThe club has had several kit suppliers and shirt sponsors throughout its history. The current kit supplier is Puma, and the current shirt sponsor is Unibet.\n\n# Stadium\n\nAston Villa's current home venue is Villa Park, the team previously played at Aston Park (1874-1876) and Wellington Road (1876-1897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. In 2022, the club announced plans to rebuild the North Stand and part of the Trinity Road stand, which will take the maximum capacity over 50,000.\n\n# Ownership\n\nThe first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues. FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself. This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s. He was chairman and substantial shareholder of \"Aston Villa F.C.\" from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006. The club were floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation. In 2006, it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa.\n\n# Social Responsibility\n\nAston Villa has a unique relationship with the Acorns Children's Hospice charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated the front of its kit shirts, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and more funds. Outside of the shirt sponsorship, the club has paid for hospice care for the charity, as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.\n\n# Aston Villa Foundation\n\nIn 2016, Aston Villa created a registered charity, the Aston Villa Foundation. The aim of the charity is to deliver the social responsibility work of Aston Villa. Working alongside key local and national stakeholders, the Foundation delivers projects such as football in the community, disability, health and wellbeing, education, interventions, and community relations.\n\n# Supporters and Rivalries\n\nAston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the Midlands and beyond, with supporters' clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98% white. When Randy Lerner's regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve the support from ethnic minorities. A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community, including Aston Pride. A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region. The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision-making process. Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the board. In 2011, the club supported a supporter-based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park. The song \"The Bells Are Ringing\" is to be played before games.\n\n# Statistics\n\nThe 2024-25 campaign is Aston Villa's 111th season in the top tier of English football. The only club to have spent longer in the top flight are Everton, with 122 seasons, making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played fixture in English top-flight football. Aston Villa were relegated from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in 1992-93, but were promoted back in 2018-19. They are ninth in the All-time FA Premier League table, and have the fifth-highest total of major honours (20) won by an English club.\n\n# Honours\n\nAston Villa Football Club have won European and domestic league honours. The club's last English honour was in 1996 when they won the League Cup, and most recently they won the 2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n\nDomestic Honours:\n\n* Football League First Division (7): 1887-88, 1898-99, 1899-1900, 1909-10, 1920-21, 1955-56, 1980-81\n* Football League Second Division (6): 1905-06, 1909-10, 1929-30, 1938-39, 1971-72, 2018-19\n* FA Cup (7): 1886-87, 1894-95, 1896-97, 1904-05, 1913-14, 1920-21, 1957-58\n* FA Community Shield (3): 1981, 1994, 2019\n\nEuropean Honours:\n\n* UEFA Intertoto Cup (1): 2001\n\n## Club Captains\n\nSince the foundation of the club in 1874, forty-two players have been club captain of Aston Villa. John Devey, who was captain from 1891 to 1898, is their most successful captain, leading Villa to five league titles and two FA Cup triumphs during the club's 'Golden Age'. Villa's longest-serving captain is George Cummings, who led the team from 1938 to 1949, albeit with the interruption of World War II in between. The present captain is Scotland international John McGinn.\n\n## Notable Players\n\nThere have been many players who can be called notable throughout Aston Villa's history. These can be classified and recorded in several forms. Aston Villa have had several players who were one-club men, including inaugural club Hall of Fame inductee Billy Walker. In 1998, to celebrate the 100th season of League football, The Football League released a list entitled the Football League 100 Legends that consisted of \"100 legendary football players\". There were seven players included on the list who played for Villa: Danny Blanchflower, Trevor Ford, Archie Hunter, Sam Hardy, Paul McGrath, Clem Stephenson, and Peter Schmeichel, who would go on to play for Villa three seasons later. Schmeichel was later inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2022, with former Villa captain and coach John Terry inducted in 2024.\n\n## Non-Playing Staff and International Academies\n\nThe club has a number of non-playing staff and international academies that support the team. These include coaches, trainers, physiotherapists, and administrative staff. The club also has partnerships with international academies and youth development programs that help to identify and develop young players.\n\n## Corporate Hierarchy and International Academies\n\nThe club has a corporate hierarchy that includes the CEO, chairman, and other senior executives. The club also has a number of international academies and partnerships that help to support the team and develop young players.\n\n## Notable Managers\n\nThe following managers have all won at least one trophy when in charge or have been notable for Villa in the context of the League, for example Jozef Vengloš who holds a League record.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

Handsworth: which is now part of Birmingham [12] The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood, who were members of the chapel's cricket team looking for a way to stay fit during the winter months [13] Due to the lack of local football teams Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules Villa won their first game 1–0 [14]\n\n\nFormation and rise to prominence

football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager The following advert was placed in the Birmingham Daily Gazette newspaper in June 1886:\n\n\nRelative decline and first relegation (1920–1939)\nIn January 1920, Billy Walker scored twice on his Villa debut in a 2–1 FA Cup first-round win over QPR; the club won the FA Cup for the sixth time that season and Walker went on to establish himself as Villa's star player of the 1920s, scoring a record 244 goals in 531 appearances, captaining Villa and England George Ramsay retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement Billy Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, in reality several other football clubs had caught up with Aston Villa, most notably Arsenal, who the club finished runners-up to in the league in 1930–31 and 1932–33 Despite missing out on the league title, Villa Park crowds were entertained by attacking football, the 128 goals scored in 1930–31, remains the all-time top-flight

while Resident Evil 7 was still about a half a year from release, according to director Morimasa Sato [24] Without having RE7's release to judge its success, the team kept the initial designs around the core survival horror gameplay roots that had been in Resident Evil 4 (RE4) and had been a return to form in RE7 [24] During this early period they came up with the concept of the village as the central theme, inspired by RE4, where its village was also a central location as well as many of the gameplay mechanics established by the title [24] The team used RE4's approach to create \"a balance of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving\" [16] Sato said that for the new game, \"we're bringing the essence of Resident Evil 4, while Resident Evil 7 functions as the base for the game\" [24] Looking back at the use of horror of RE7, producer Tsuyoshi Kanda said, \"One of the lessons we took away is that this isn't something that is black and white, it's always going to have some variation or modification, and figuring out, OK, this worked for  [RE7], but rather than replicating it, let's find a variation that works for a wider audience.\" The development team opted for a more balanced take on action and horror for Village [25]\n\n\nRelease and promotion\nLady Dimitrescu, a character who rose in popularity prior to the game's release, was featured extensively in promotional material and merchandise prior to the game's launch [40] [41] To promote the game, Capcom announced that a special lottery event would be held to give away a free Resident Evil Village acrylic jigsaw puzzle which could be entered by tweeting the hashtag #VILLAGE予約 [42] On March 3, AMD announced that the PC version would feature ray tracing and AMD FidelityFX [43] Resident Evil Village was the featured cover game in the April 2021 issue of Game Informer [44] On April 30, 2021, a puppet show featuring the four lords was released on YouTube, with each puppet claiming that they are not scary [45] On

Heisenberg as additional playable characters for the Mercenaries mode The expansion released for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S versions on October 28, 2022,

aggregator website Metacritic [63] [65] [66]\n\n\nWindows performance\nThe Windows version of the game had performance problems, particularly during intense combat Richard Leadbetter of Digital Foundry noted the \"tremendously high frame times\" and \"extraordinary\" stuttering, especially during encounters with the maidens and other enemies with certain animations Leadbetter attributed this to a combination of Denuvo along with Capcom's own anti-tamper software In July 2021, a pirated version of the game by an independent cracker was released, effectively stripping away the Denuvo and Capcom digital rights management (DRM) software [75] Leadbetter tested this version against the original release and was able to confirm that the crack improved upon the game's performance, stating that \"By stripping out what the hackers call Capcom's entry points for the DRM.. the game is absolutely transformed in those areas.\" A similar problem where Capcom had added additional DRM atop Denuvo had affected Devil May Cry 5 for Windows, and after Capcom's official update that removed Denuvo and its DRM, Devil May Cry 5's performance was improved [76] Capcom released a patch for Village later that July that, among other changes, altered how the game used Denuvo [77] Leadbetter found that the patch improved performance, running equivalent to the pirated version [78]\n\n\nAlleged plagiarism\nShortly after release, film director Richard Raaphorst accused Capcom of plagiarism, citing close similarities between a monster that was featured in his film Frankenstein's Army and the \"Sturm\" creature in Resident Evil Village [79] [80] [81]\n\n\nSales\nResident Evil Village shipped over three million units in its first four days of release, becoming the third-fastest-selling

Evil Village received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic [63] [65] [66]\n\n\nWindows performance\nThe Windows version of the game had performance problems, particularly during intense combat Richard Leadbetter of Digital Foundry noted the \"tremendously high frame times\" and \"extraordinary\" stuttering, especially during encounters with the maidens and other enemies with certain animations Leadbetter attributed this to a combination of Denuvo along with Capcom's own anti-tamper software In July 2021, a pirated version of the game by an independent cracker was released, effectively stripping away the Denuvo and Capcom digital rights management (DRM) software [75] Leadbetter tested this version against the original release and was able to confirm that the crack improved upon the game's performance, stating that \"By stripping out what the hackers call Capcom's entry points for the DRM.. the game is absolutely transformed in those areas.\" A similar problem where Capcom had added additional DRM atop Denuvo had affected Devil May Cry 5 for Windows, and after Capcom's official update that removed Denuvo and its DRM, Devil May Cry 5's performance was improved [76] Capcom released a patch for Village later that July that, among other changes, altered how the game used Denuvo [77] Leadbetter found that the patch improved performance, running equivalent to the pirated version [78]\n\n\nAlleged plagiarism\nShortly after release, film director Richard Raaphorst accused Capcom of plagiarism, citing close similarities between a monster that was featured in his film Frankenstein's Army and the \"Sturm\" creature in Resident Evil Village [79] [80] [81]\n\n\nSales\nResident Evil Village shipped over three

units in a week The PlayStation 5 version sold 38,713 units, reaching fourth place in the charts [83] Resident Evil Village was also the best-selling game across the United States and the United Kingdom during the month of May 2021 [84] [85] It went on to become the eighth best-selling game of 2021 in the US [86] The game sold 6.1 million units worldwide by May 2022, [87] and reached 6.4

Stan Zabka is of Czech descent and was born in Des Moines, Iowa. William has a brother and a sister. Stan Zabka worked as a production manager on many motion pictures, including the Chuck Norris film Forced Vengeance (1982).\n\nGrowing up, Zabka was exposed to the creative arts, with his father's career in film and music influencing his own interests. This exposure would later shape his career as an actor, director, and martial artist. Zabka's early life was marked by a strong interest in sports, particularly wrestling, which he would later draw upon in his acting career.\n\n**Career**\n\nZabka's breakout acting role came in his first movie, The Karate Kid (1984). He played Johnny Lawrence, the main antagonist to the title character and protagonist played by Ralph Macchio. At the time, Zabka had no training in karate, but was an accomplished wrestler. Participating in the film inspired Zabka to learn the martial art of Tang Soo Do, and he later earned a second-degree green belt.\n\nThe Karate Kid was a massive commercial success, grossing over $350 million worldwide and cementing Zabka's status as a teen idol. His portrayal of Johnny Lawrence has become iconic in popular culture, with the character's iconic yellow jumpsuit and bleached-blond hair becoming a symbol of 80s nostalgia. Zabka's performance was praised for its nuance and complexity, bringing depth to a character that could have easily been a one-dimensional villain.\n\nIn addition to The Karate Kid, Zabka has appeared in a number of other films and television shows, including The Burning (1981), Rappin' (1985), and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1993). He has also worked as a director, helming episodes of the TV series The Shield (2002-2008) and The Mentalist (2008-2015).\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nZabka married his wife, Stacie, in 2008, and they have two children. The couple has kept their personal lives relatively private, with Zabka rarely speaking publicly about his family. However, in a 2014 interview with The Los Angeles Times, Zabka spoke about the importance of family and how his role as a father has influenced his career.\n\n\"I've always been a bit of a workaholic, and I've learned to balance my work and family life,\" Zabka said. \"Being a father has taught me to prioritize and to be more present in the moment. It's been a game-changer for me.\"\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* The Karate Kid (1984)\n* The Burning (1981)\n* Rappin' (1985)\n* The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1993)\n* The Shield (2002-2008)\n* The Mentalist (2008-2015)\n* Cobra Kai (2018-2022)\n\n**Award Nominations**\n\n* 1985: Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama (The Karate Kid)\n* 1986: Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (The Karate Kid)\n* 2019: Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series (Cobra Kai)\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* William Zabka on IMDb\n* William Zabka on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"William_Zabka\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nZabka was born in New York City, the son of Nancy, a business liaison, producer, and production assistant, and Stan Zabka, a director, writer, and composer [5] Zabka has a brother and a sister Stan is of Czech descent and was born in Des Moines, Iowa [6] He worked as production manager on many motion pictures, including the Chuck Norris film Forced Vengeance (1982) [7]\n\n\nCareer\nZabka's breakout acting role came in his first movie, The Karate Kid (1984) Zabka played Johnny Lawrence, the main antagonist to the title character and protagonist played by Ralph Macchio At the time, Zabka had no training in karate, but was an accomplished wrestler [9] Participating in the film inspired Zabka to learn the martial art of Tang Soo Do and he later earned a second–degree green belt [3]\n\n\nPersonal life\nZabka married his wife, Stacie, in 2008 and they have two children [20]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nAward nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Created by French writer Maurice Leblanc, Lupin is a charismatic and cunning thief who operates on the wrong side of the law, often for the greater good. This article provides an in-depth exploration of Lupin's origins, evolution, and impact on popular culture, as well as his appearances in various forms of media.\n\n# Antecedents\n\nArsène Lupin is a literary descendant of Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail's fictional character Rocambole, whose adventures were published from 1857 to 1870. Like Rocambole, Lupin is often a force for good while operating on the wrong side of the law. Lupin shares similarities with E.W. Hornung's gentleman thief A.J. Raffles, whose stories were published from 1898 to 1909. Both Raffles and Lupin have inspired later characters such as Louis Joseph Vance's The Lone Wolf (created in 1914) and Leslie Charteris's The Saint (created in 1928).\n\n# Overview\n\nLupin was featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas by Leblanc, with the novellas or short stories collected into book form for a total of 24 books. The number becomes 25 if the 1923 novel The Secret Tomb is counted: Lupin does not appear in it, but the main character Dorothée solves one of Arsène Lupin's four fabulous secrets. Through these stories, Leblanc developed the character's persona, exploring themes of justice, morality, and the complexities of human nature.\n\n# Arsène Lupin and Sherlock Holmes\n\nLeblanc introduced Sherlock Holmes to Lupin in the short story \"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\" in Je sais tout No 17, 15 June 1906. In it, an aged Holmes meets a young Lupin for the first time. After legal objections from Arthur Conan Doyle, the name was changed to \"Herlock Sholmès.\" This change was either due to literary copyright on the character or, as Maurice Leblanc's son claims, because Conan Doyle asked his father for this change.\n\n## Leblanc's \"Herlock Sholmès\"\n\nLeblanc's \"Herlock Sholmès\" stories were a unique blend of Sherlockian detective work and Lupin's cunning thievery. These tales often featured the two characters engaging in intellectual battles, with Lupin outwitting Holmes at every turn. Through these stories, Leblanc explored the idea of a cat-and-mouse game between two of literature's greatest detectives.\n\n## Other Sherlock Holmes references\n\nSherlock Holmes, this time with his real name and accompanied by familiar characters such as Watson and Lestrade (all copyright protection having expired), also confronted Arsène Lupin in the 2008 PC 3D adventure game Sherlock Holmes Versus Arsène Lupin. In this game, Holmes (and occasionally others) are attempting to stop Lupin from stealing five valuable British items. Lupin wants to steal the items in order to humiliate Britain, but he also admires Holmes and thus challenges him to try to stop him.\n\n# Stories by other writers\n\nWhile Maurice Leblanc's stories remain the most iconic and influential, other writers have also contributed to the Arsène Lupin canon. These writers, such as Jean D'Espagnat and Jean-Pierre Pinard, have explored new themes and ideas, often incorporating elements of science fiction and fantasy into their tales.\n\n## France\n\nIn France, Arsène Lupin has remained a beloved character, with numerous adaptations and reinterpretations over the years. From films to stage productions, Lupin has been reimagined in various forms, often incorporating elements of French culture and history.\n\n## Japan\n\nIn Japan, Arsène Lupin has gained a significant following, particularly among fans of science fiction and fantasy. Japanese writers such as Osamu Tezuka have reinterpreted Lupin in the context of Japanese culture, often incorporating elements of anime and manga into their tales.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, Arsène Lupin has been less widely known, although he has gained a small but dedicated following in recent years. American writers such as Will Murray have reimagined Lupin in the context of American culture, often incorporating elements of pulp fiction and noir into their tales.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Leblanc, Maurice.

basketball coach. He is currently the head coach of the University of North Carolina men's basketball team.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nHubert Davis is a highly accomplished individual with a storied career in basketball. From his college days at the University of North Carolina to his professional career in the NBA, Davis has consistently demonstrated his skills and dedication to the sport. After retiring from professional basketball, Davis transitioned into a successful career as a sports analyst and coach. In 2022, he made history by becoming the first African-American head coach of the University of North Carolina men's basketball team.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nHubert Davis attended Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia, where he developed his basketball skills and earned a reputation as a standout player. During his senior year, Davis averaged 28.0 points per game, showcasing his impressive scoring ability. He attended the same high school as future Tar Heel women's soccer great and Olympic medalist Mia Hamm. Davis then went on to attend the University of North Carolina, where he holds the record for the highest career three-point percentage in school history.\n\nAt the University of North Carolina, Davis was an integral part of the men's basketball team. In his junior year, he helped lead the team to its first Final Four appearance since winning the national championship in 1982. Davis graduated in 1992 with a degree in Criminal Justice, after averaging 21.4 points per game in his senior season.\n\nNBA Career\n------------\n\nThe New York Knicks selected Hubert Davis with the 20th overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. During his professional career, Davis established himself as a reliable three-point shooter. He made the winning free throws after Hue Hollins called a disputed foul against Scottie Pippen in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Chicago Bulls, giving the Knicks an 87–86 win. The Knicks went on to win the series in seven games.\n\nDavis also set the Knicks franchise records for single-season (.476, 1995–96) and career (.449) three-point shooting percentages. His impressive shooting ability and clutch performances made him a key contributor to the Knicks' success during his time with the team.\n\nSports Analyst\n--------------\n\nAfter retiring from professional basketball, Hubert Davis began working for ESPN as a college basketball analyst in the 2007–2008 season. During his time at ESPN, he served as a studio analyst for the network's coverage of college basketball and was a panelist on College Gameday. Davis's expertise and insights provided valuable commentary for fans and analysts alike.\n\nCoaching Career\n----------------\n\nPrior to the 2012–2013 season, UNC head coach Roy Williams hired Davis as an assistant. Davis also served as head coach of UNC's junior varsity basketball team, one of the only junior varsity teams remaining in college basketball. UNC's junior varsity program is a long-standing program tradition, and several former JV players have gone on to be walk-ons for the varsity team.\n\nNorth Carolina Assistant Coach\n-------------------------------\n\nUnder Roy Williams' guidance, Davis honed his coaching skills and learned the ins and outs of the program. As an assistant coach, Davis was responsible for recruiting, game planning, and developing the team's strategy. His experience and expertise made him an invaluable asset to the coaching staff.\n\nNorth Carolina Head Coach\n-------------------------\n\nFollowing Roy Williams' retirement, Davis was named the 19th head coach in program history, and became the first African-American to lead the program. The move was initially met with some criticism, as Davis had never been a head coach at any level. However, Williams had been grooming him for a head coaching job much in the same way that Dean Smith had mentored Williams during Williams' time as a Tar Heel assistant coach from 1978 to 1988.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nHubert Davis and his wife Leslie have three children: Elijah, Bobbie Grace, and Micah. As of the 2021–22 season, Elijah plays college basketball for the University of Lynchburg. At the press conference announcing his hiring as the UNC basketball coach, when asked about being the first black UNC head coach, Davis caused public debate by stating he's proud to be African-American but also proud that his wife is white. Davis is a devout Christian and has spoken publicly about the importance of faith in his life.\n\nCareer Playing Statistics\n-------------------------\n\n* National Champion: 1992\n* Postseason

Palma was born on April 29, 1960, in Noria de Abajo, Mocorito, Sinaloa, and rose to prominence as a co-leader of the Guadalajara Cartel, alongside Abelardo \"El Lobito\" Retamoza Machado. He was also closely associated with Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, another notorious Mexican drug lord.\n\n## Early Life and Career\n\nPalma began his life of crime as a car thief and eventually worked as a gunman for Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the leader of the Guadalajara Cartel. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a trusted associate of Gallardo. Palma's involvement with the cartel led him to become a key player in the organization's operations, including its involvement in drug trafficking and other illicit activities.\n\n## First Arrest and Family's Murder\n\nIn 1978, Palma was arrested in Arizona for drug trafficking and sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison. Upon his release, he discovered that his wife, Guadalupe Leija Serrano, had run off with Clavel and taken their two children with her. This personal betrayal would prove to be a significant setback for Palma, but it did not deter him from continuing his involvement in the cartel.\n\n## Second Arrest\n\nPalma's second arrest occurred on June 23, 1995, after a 12-seat Lear jet on which he was flying crash-landed. The jet, which was traveling from Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, to Guadalajara, Jalisco, was unable to locate a new landing strip in time and was forced to make an emergency landing. Palma survived the crash-landing and was later arrested by Mexican military officers. At the time of his arrest, Palma was traveling in full uniform as a Federal Judicial Police (PJF) officer, complete with identification and an armed caravan of PJF personnel. This ruse allowed him to evade capture for a time, but he was eventually apprehended by the authorities.\n\n## Kingpin Act Sanction\n\nOn June 2, 2003, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Palma under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to as the Kingpin Act) for his involvement in drug trafficking. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.\n\n## Corruption\n\nPalma's ability to evade capture and detection was largely due to his involvement in corrupt activities within the Mexican Federal Judicial Police (PJF). He managed to insert himself into the depths of the PJF, posing as a PJF officer in complete uniform, with identification, and traveling in a heavily armed caravan of PJF officers. It was later discovered that he was able to evade capture by staying at the home of the local police commander, further highlighting the extent of his corruption.\n\n## In Popular Culture\n\nPalma has been featured in the popular Netflix series Narcos: Mexico, where he is portrayed by actor Gorka Lasaosa. The show provides a dramatized account of Palma's life and his involvement with the Guadalajara Cartel, offering a glimpse into the world of Mexican organized crime.\n\nSee also:\n\n* Guadalajara Cartel\n* Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán\n* Mexican Federal Judicial Police\n* Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Héctor_Luis_Palma_Salazar\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and career\nJesús Héctor Luis Palma Salazar was born in Noria de Abajo, Mocorito, Sinaloa, on April 29, 1960 [3] [4] He began as a car thief and eventually worked as a gunman for Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo of the Guadalajara Cartel [5] Palma rose up the ranks and, along with Abelardo \"El Lobito\" Retamoza Machado, eventually became a co-leader of the cartel He was associated with Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán.\n\n\nFirst arrest and family's murder\nIn 1978, Palma was arrested in Arizona for drug trafficking and sentenced to eight years in a U.S prison Upon his release, he discovered that his wife, Guadalupe Leija Serrano, had run off with Clavel and taken her and Palma's two children.\n\n\nSecond arrest\nPalma was arrested on June 23, 1995, after a 12-seat Lear jet on which he was flying to attend a wedding party crash-landed He was traveling from Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, to Guadalajara, Jalisco, when the jet was diverted and unable to locate a new landing strip in time Palma survived the crash-landing and was later arrested by Mexican military officers; he originally evaded capture by traveling in full uniform as a Federal Judicial Police (PJF) officer complete with identification and an armed caravan of PJF personnel [9]\n\n\nKingpin Act sanction\nOn 2 June 2003, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Palma under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the Kingpin Act) for his involvement in drug trafficking, along with six other international criminals and three entities [13] The act prohibited U.S citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S [14]\n\n\nCorruption\nPalma had managed to insert himself into the depths of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police (PJF), evading detection by posing as one in complete uniform, with identification, and traveling in a heavily armed caravan of PJF officers It was later discovered he was able to evade capture by staying at the home of the local police commander [9]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn Narcos: Mexico seasons 1–3, Palma is played by Gorka Lasaosa.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game features a new storyline, setting, and gameplay mechanics, while maintaining the spirit of the original series.\n\n**Gameplay**\nSimilar to previous installments in the series, Saints Row is an open-world action game with third-person shooter elements where players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the main story. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's world and complete optional side activities. The game's setting, the fictional city of Santo Ileso, is broken down into nine districts, which players will have to work towards taking over in the name of their gang, The Saints, earning certain benefits in the process. After taking over a district, players are able to use empty lots found there to launch illegitimate businesses with legitimate fronts to help finance and benefit the gang. The city includes more vertical areas with tools that the player will be able to use to take advantage of that. The driving gameplay has been improved from previous Saints Row games to encourage the use of vehicles as weapons themselves alongside guns.\n\n**Synopsis**\nSaints Row is set in the fictional city of Santo Ileso, located in the American southwest and modeled after Las Vegas, Nevada. At the start of the game, the city is controlled by two warring gangs: Los Panteros, a gritty vehicle and fitness-oriented gang that runs smuggling and protection; and the Idols, an anarcho-communist gang focused on clubs and nightlife. A third faction, Marshall Defense Industries, an international private military corporation known for its high-tech weaponry, is also based in Santo Ileso, and attempts to eradicate all gang presence in the city while increasing its own influence.\n\n**Setting**\nSaints Row is set in the fictional city of Santo Ileso, located in the American southwest and modeled after Las Vegas, Nevada. The city is a hub of activity, with a diverse population and a rich cultural scene. The city is divided into nine districts, each with its own unique character and attractions. Players can explore the city, complete missions, and engage in side activities to earn rewards and experience.\n\n**Plot**\nOn the first day of work for Marshall Defense Industries, the Boss apprehends a notorious criminal known as \"The Nahualli,\" but is denied a performance bonus by the strict superior, Gwen Theriault. Nevertheless, the Boss returns to a rented apartment to celebrate this success with friends and roommates Eli, Kevin, and Neenah. Although affiliated with rival groups (Kevin with the Idols and Neenah with Los Panteros), the four remain more loyal to each other, and often engage in criminal activities together to afford their rent and student loans.\n\n**Development**\nTHQ Nordic announced in August 2019 that Volition was developing a full entry in the Saints Row series. Parent organization Koch Media, owner of the Saints Row intellectual property, said they were giving the developer time and space to make the game they saw fit. The series had a rocky history in the years prior to the reboot's development. The prior full game in the series was Saints Row IV (2013), which was followed by a standalone expansion titled Saints Row: Gat out of Hell (2015). A series spin-off, Agents of Mayhem (2017), sold poorly and led to layoffs at Volition. Saints Row was officially announced as a reboot of the franchise at the August 2021 Gamescom, which was met with divided opinion on social media for not retaining the \"feel\" of prior series entries.\n\n**Reception**\nSaints Row received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviews focused on the large number of bugs following launch, leading the Washington Post to call it \"barely playable.\" Other major concerns were with the quality of the story and writing, and parts of the gameplay feeling dated. Gamespot wrote that while the combat and story were adequate, that the game \"struggled to live up to its legacy.\" EGM praised the \"great open-world city and respectable gameplay fundamentals,\" but was disappointed in \"a story that never finds its footing, and too many bugs to count.\"\n\n**Sales**\nAccording to Volition's parent company Embracer Group, Saints Row's pre-order sales had exceeded the publisher's expectations. Saints Row was the biggest-selling physical game in the UK, topping the charts in its debut week of release and selling more than five times the number of units as Volition's 2017 game Agents of Mayhem. For week 2 of UK sales, Saints Row experienced an 80% drop in sales, falling from No 1 to No 6 on the chart. During August, Saints Row was the best-selling digital game, and the second-best-selling physical game behind Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. In Japan, during its first week of release, the PlayStation 4 version was the ninth-best-selling retail game, with 10,013 physical units sold; the PlayStation 5 version was the twelfth-best-selling retail game, with 7,622 physical units sold.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saints_Row_(2022_video_game)\" following this outline:\n\n\nGameplay\nSimilar to previous installments in the series, Saints Row is an open world action game with third-person shooter elements where players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the main story Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's world and complete optional side activities The game's setting, the fictional city of Santo Ileso, is broken down into nine districts, which players will have to work towards taking over in the name of their gang, The Saints, earning certain benefits in the process After taking over a district, players are able to use empty lots found there to launch illegitimate businesses with legitimate fronts to help finance and benefit the gang [1] The city includes more vertical areas with tools that the player will be able to use to take advantage of that [1] [2] The driving gameplay has been improved from previous Saints Row games to encourage the use of vehicles as weapons themselves alongside guns [3]\n\n\nSynopsis\nSaints Row is set in the fictional city of Santo Ileso, located in the American southwest and modeled after Las Vegas, Nevada At the start of the game, the city is controlled by two warring gangs: Los Panteros, a gritty vehicle and fitness-oriented gang that runs smuggling and protection;

corporate workstations It grew into a product line of its own and now consists of four sub-families that tend to be released almost simultaneously and share the same kernel.\n\n\nVersion history\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\" NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2 Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nEarly versions\nThe history of Windows dates back to 1981 when Microsoft started work on a program called \"Interface Manager\" The name \"Windows\" comes from the fact that the system was one of the first to use graphical boxes to represent programs; in the industry, at the time, these were called \"windows\" and the underlying software was called \"windowing software.\" [13] It was announced in November 1983 (after the Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name \"Windows\", but Windows 1.0 was not released until November 1985 [18] Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard Viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows Instead, all windows are tiled Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows Microsoft sold as included Windows Development libraries with the C development environment, which included numerous windows samples [19]\n\n\nWindows 3.x\nWindows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications [citation needed] Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode, which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme They run inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly Windows 3.0 was the first version of Windows to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months [25] [26]\n\n\nWindows 9x\nThe next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995 While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that \"by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world.\" [30] Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer [31] Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001 [32]\n\n\nWindows NT\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation

ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nWindows XP\nThe next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released to manufacturing (RTM) on August 24, 2001, and to the general public on October 25, 2001 The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a \"task-oriented\" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, a \"compatibility mode\" to help provide backwards compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality [38] [39]\n\n\nWindows Vista\nAfter a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC, and stricter license agreement Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.\n\n\nWindows 7\nOn July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released to manufacturing (RTM) and released to the public three months later on October 22, 2009 Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible [44] Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain shortcuts to files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application, [45] a home networking system called HomeGroup, [46] and performance improvements.\n\n\nWindows 8 and 8.1\nWindows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012 A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels, [47] effectively making it unfit for netbooks with 800×600-pixel screens.\n\n\nWindows 10\nOn September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1 It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8 Changes on PC include the return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7) [56]\n\n\nWindows 11\nOn June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was announced as the successor to Windows 10 during a livestream The new operating system was designed to be more user-friendly and understandable It was released on October 5, 2021 [62] [63] As of May 2022, [update] Windows 11 is a free upgrade to Windows 10 users who meet the system requirements [64]\n\n\nWindows 365\nIn July 2021, Microsoft announced it will start selling subscriptions to virtualized Windows desktops as part of a new Windows 365 service in the following month The new service will allow for cross-platform usage, aiming to make the operating system available for both Apple and Android users It is a separate service and offers several variations including Windows 365 Frontline, Windows 365 Boot, and the Windows 365 app [65] The subscription service will be accessible through any operating system with a web browser The new service is an attempt at capitalizing on the growing trend, fostered during the COVID-19 pandemic, for businesses to adopt a hybrid remote work environment, in which \"employees split their time between the office and home\" As the service will be accessible through web browsers, Microsoft will be able to bypass the need to publish the service through Google Play or the Apple App Store [66] [67] [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nMultilingual support\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3.0 The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel Components for all supported input languages, such as Input Method Editors, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and files for right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel) Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs Since Windows 2000, English editions of Windows NT have East Asian IMEs (such as Microsoft Pinyin IME and Microsoft Japanese IME) bundled, but files for East Asian languages may be manually installed on Control Panel.\n\n\nPlatform support\nWindows NT included support for several platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world Windows NT 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000 (although some of the platforms implement 64-bit computing, the OS treated them as 32-bit) Windows 2000 dropped support for all platforms, except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode The client line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows 10 [64] (the server line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows Server 2008).\n\n\nWindows CE\nWindows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.\n\n\nXbox OS\nXbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on Xbox consoles [73] From Xbox One onwards it is an implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using Hyper-V) as it is three operating systems running at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment for applications [74]\nMicrosoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC [75] It was originally based on NT 6.2 (Windows 8) kernel, and the latest version runs on an NT 10.0 base This system is sometimes referred to as \"Windows 10 on Xbox One\" [76] [77]\nXbox One and Xbox Series operating systems also allow limited (due to licensing restrictions and testing resources) backward compatibility with previous generation hardware, [78] and the Xbox 360's system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox [79]\n\n\nVersion control system\nUp to and including every version before Windows 2000, Microsoft used an in-house version control system named Source Library Manager (SLM) Shortly after Windows 2000 was released, Microsoft switched to a fork of Perforce named Source Depot [80] This system was used up until 2017 once the system could not keep up with the size of Windows [citation needed] Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into Team Foundation Server in 2013, [81] but Windows (and Office) continued to rely on Source Depot [82] The Windows code was divided among 65 different repositories with a kind of virtualization layer to produce unified view of all of the code [citation needed]\n\n\nVFSForGit\nBecause of its large, decades-long history, however, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of Linux development that Git was originally created to manage [citation needed] Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, [85] which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the whole repository takes several hours [citation needed] Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges [84]\n\n\nTimeline of releases\nVersion market share\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, [90] according to StatCounter data as of October 2024 [91]:\n\n\nUsage share and device sales\nVersion market share\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, [90] according to StatCounter data as of October 2024 [91]:\n\n\nSecurity\nEarly versions of Windows were designed at a time where malware and networking were less common, and had few built-in security features; they did not provide access privileges to allow a user to prevent other users from accessing their files, and they did not provide memory protection to prevent one process from reading or writing another process's address space or to prevent a process from code or data used by privileged-mode code.\n\n\nFile permissions\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGDLP (Accounts, Global, Domain Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directly to the file or folder However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.\n\n\nAlternative implementations\nOwing to the operating system's popularity, a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as a compatibility layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system that can run software written for Windows out of the box These include:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Microsoft Windows**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMicrosoft Windows is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft. It is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, with a market share of over 90%. The first version of Windows was released in 1985, and since then, it has become an essential tool for personal computers, laptops, and mobile devices.\n\n**Product Line**\n\nAs of today, the only active top-level family is Windows NT. The first version, Windows NT 3.1, was intended for server computing and corporate workstations. It grew into a product line of its own and now consists of four sub-families that tend to be released almost simultaneously and share the same kernel.\n\n**Version History**\n\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\".

While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors. Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object-oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell. Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that \"by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world.\" Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack. The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer. Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.\n\n**Windows NT**\n\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\". NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.\n\n**Windows XP**\n\nThe next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released to manufacturing (RTM) on August 24, 2001, and to the general public on October 25, 2001. The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors. Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a \"task-oriented\" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, a \"compatibility mode\" to help provide backwards compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality.\n\n**Windows Vista**\n\nAfter a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers. It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features. It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC, and stricter license agreement. Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.\n\n**Windows 7**\n\nOn July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released to manufacturing (RTM) and released to the public three months later on October 22, 2009. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible. Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain shortcuts to files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application, a home networking system called HomeGroup, and performance improvements.\n\n**Windows 8 and 8.1**\n\nWindows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels, effectively making it unfit for netbooks with 800×600-pixel screens.\n\n**Windows 10**\n\nOn September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes on PC include the return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode. Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7).\n\n**Windows 11**\n\nOn June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was announced as the successor to Windows 10 during a livestream. The new operating system was designed to be more user-friendly and understandable. It was released on October 5, 2021. As of May 2022, Windows 11 is a free upgrade to Windows 10 users who meet the system requirements.\n\n**Windows 365**\n\nIn July 2021, Microsoft announced it will start selling subscriptions to virtualized Windows desktops as part of a new Windows 365 service in the following month. The new service will allow for cross-platform usage, aiming to make the operating system available for both Apple and Android users. It is a separate service and offers several variations including Windows 365 Frontline, Windows 365 Boot, and the Windows 365 app. The subscription service will be accessible through any operating system with a web browser. The new service is an attempt at capitalizing on the growing trend, fostered during the COVID-19 pandemic, for businesses to adopt a hybrid remote work environment, in which \"employees split their time between the office and home.\" As the service will be accessible through web browsers, Microsoft will be able to bypass the need to publish the service through Google Play or the Apple App Store.\n\n**Multilingual Support**\n\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3.0. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as Input Method Editors, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and files for right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs. Since Windows 2000, English editions of Windows NT have East Asian IMEs (such as Microsoft Pinyin IME and Microsoft Japanese IME) bundled, but files for East Asian languages may be manually installed on Control Panel.\n\n**Platform Support**\n\nWindows NT included support for several platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world. Windows NT 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000 (although some of the platforms implement 64-bit computing, the OS treated them as 32-bit). Windows 2000 dropped support for all platforms, except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows 10. The server line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows Server 2008.\n\n**Windows CE**\n\nWindows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers. The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.\n\n**Xbox OS**\n\nXbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on Xbox consoles. From Xbox One onwards it is an implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using Hyper-V) as it is three operating systems running at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment for applications. Microsoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC. It was originally based on NT 6.2 (Windows 8) kernel, and the latest version runs on an NT 10.0 base. This system is sometimes referred to as \"Windows 10 on Xbox One\".\n\n**Version Control System**\n\nUp to and including every version before Windows 2000, Microsoft used an in-house version control system named Source Library Manager (SLM). Shortly after Windows 2000 was released, Microsoft switched to a fork of Perforce named Source Depot. This system was used up until 2017 once the system could not keep up with the size of Windows. Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into Team Foundation Server in 2013, but Windows (and Office) continued to rely on Source Depot. The Windows code was divided among 65 different repositories with a kind of virtualization layer to produce unified view of all of the code.\n\n**VFSForGit**\n\nBecause of its large, decades-long history, however, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of Linux development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the whole repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.\n\n**Timeline of Releases**\n\n| Year | Release | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985 | Windows 1.0 | First version of Windows |\n| 1990 | Windows 3.0 | Improved design, virtual memory and VxDs |\n| 1995 | Windows 95 | Native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking |\n| 2000 | Windows 2000 | 32-bit support, IA-32 only |\n| 2001 | Windows XP | Unified consumer-oriented Windows 9x series and Windows NT architecture |\n| 2006 | Windows Vista | Redesigned shell and user interface, security features |\n| 2009 | Windows 7 | Focused, incremental upgrade to Windows line, compatibility with applications and hardware |\n| 2012 | Windows 8 | User interface based around Metro design language, touch-based devices |\n| 2015 | Windows 10 | Return of Start Menu, virtual desktop system, Windows Store apps |\n| 2021 | Windows 11 | Designed to be more user-friendly and understandable |\n\n**Usage Share and Device Sales**\n\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, according to StatCounter data as of October 2024:\n\n| Year | Windows Version | Usage Share |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2024 | Windows 10 | 87.2% |\n| 2024 | Windows 7 | 6.1% |\n| 2024 | Windows 8.1 | 3.4% |\n| 2024 | Windows XP | 1.2% |\n| 2024 | Other | 2.1% |\n\nNote: The usage share of other versions of Windows is relatively small compared to the top three versions.\n\n**Security**\n\nEarly versions of Windows were designed at a time where malware and networking were less common, and had few built-in security features; they did not provide access privileges to allow a user to prevent other users from accessing their files, and they did not provide memory protection to prevent one process from reading or writing another process's address space or to prevent a process from code or data used by privileged-mode code.\n\nFile permissions were first introduced in Windows NT 3, and are based on a file system permission system referred to as AGDLP (Accounts, Global, Domain Local, Permissions). In this system, file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members. These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used.\n\nAlternative implementations of Windows have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as a compatibility layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system that can run software written for Windows out of the box. These include:\n\n* Wine: A compatibility layer for Linux and other operating systems\n* CrossOver: A commercial version of Wine that can run Windows applications on Linux and other operating systems\n* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): A feature of Windows 10 that allows Linux distributions to run natively on Windows\n* Windows 10 on ARM: A version of Windows 10 that runs on ARM-based processors\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list of alternative implementations of Windows.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Microsoft_Windows\" following this outline:\n\n\nProduct line\nAs of today, the only active top-level family is Windows NT The first version, Windows NT 3.1, was intended for server computing and corporate workstations It grew into a product line of its own and now consists of four sub-families that tend to be released almost simultaneously and share the same kernel.\n\n\nVersion history\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\" NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor

existing NT kernel Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nEarly versions\nThe history of Windows dates back to 1981 when Microsoft started work on a program called \"Interface Manager\" The name \"Windows\" comes from the fact that the system was one of the first to use graphical boxes to represent programs; in the industry, at the time, these were called \"windows\" and the underlying software was called \"windowing software.\" [13] It was announced in November 1983 (after the Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name \"Windows\", but Windows 1.0 was not released until November 1985 [18] Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard Viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows Instead, all windows are tiled Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows Microsoft sold as included Windows Development libraries with the C development environment, which included numerous windows samples [19]\n\n\nWindows 3.x\nWindows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications [citation needed] Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode, which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme They run inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly Windows 3.0 was the first version of Windows to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months [25] [26]\n\n\nWindows 9x\nThe next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995 While

process's address space or to prevent a process from code or data used by privileged-mode code.\n\n\nFile permissions\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGDLP (Accounts, Global, Domain Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directly to the file or folder However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.\n\n\nAlternative implementations\nOwing to the operating system's popularity, a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as a compatibility layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system that can run

His paternal grandfather, Hans Lauda, was a Viennese-born industrialist who had founded the paper mill that his family owned. Lauda grew up in a privileged environment, with his parents providing him with every opportunity to pursue his passion for racing.\n\nLauda's early years in racing were marked by his involvement in karting, where he quickly gained a reputation as a talented and fearless driver. He moved on to Formula Three in the late 1960s, competing in the European Formula Three Championship and winning several races. In 1971, Lauda made his Formula One debut with the March team, driving in a handful of non-championship events.\n\nFerrari (1974–1977)\n\nIn 1974, Lauda joined Ferrari, a team that was struggling to regain its former glory. Despite being a relatively unknown quantity, Lauda quickly impressed the Ferrari team with his speed and consistency. He scored a second-place finish in his debut race for the team, the Argentine Grand Prix, and went on to win the Spanish Grand Prix, his first Formula One victory.\n\nLauda's first season with Ferrari was marked by a mix of inexperience and mechanical unreliability, but he demonstrated immense commitment to testing and improving the car. He became the season's pacesetter, achieving six consecutive pole positions, but ultimately finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship.\n\n1976 Nürburgring crash\n\nA week before the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, Lauda urged his fellow drivers to boycott the race, citing the organizers' lack of resources to properly manage the circuit. Despite being the fastest driver on the circuit at the time, Lauda was concerned about the safety risks posed by the 23-kilometer circuit, which lacked adequate fire marshals, fire and safety equipment, and safety vehicles. However, a majority of the drivers voted against the boycott, and the race went ahead.\n\nThe incident at the Nürburgring was a turning point in Lauda's career, as he suffered severe burns to his scalp and lungs in a crash on the first lap of the German Grand Prix. He was rushed to the hospital and underwent a lengthy recovery process, during which he was forced to undergo multiple skin grafts and a lung transplant.\n\nReturn to racing\n\nLauda made a remarkable comeback to racing, missing only two races before returning to the circuit. He finished fourth in the Italian Grand Prix, despite being \"absolutely petrified\" by the experience. Lauda's determination and resilience in the face of adversity inspired his fellow drivers and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time.\n\nBrabham and first retirement (1978–1979)\n\nLauda joined Brabham-Alfa Romeo in 1978, where he endured two unsuccessful seasons. The team's BT46B car, which Lauda drove in a handful of races, was a radical design known as the Fan Car, which won its only race at the Swedish Grand Prix. However, the car was protested by other teams, and Lauda was unable to replicate his success with the Brabham team.\n\nMcLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982–1985)\n\nIn 1982, Lauda returned to racing with McLaren, where he won his third Formula One World Championship title. Lauda's comeback to McLaren was marked by a successful test with the team, and he quickly proved himself to be a force to be reckoned with. He won the Long Beach Grand Prix in his third race back and went on to dominate the 1982 season.\n\nLater management roles\n\nLauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position in 1993, when he joined Ferrari as a consultant. He later became the team principal of the Jaguar Formula One team in 2001, but was made redundant at the end of 2002.\n\nRoles beyond Formula One\n\nLauda returned to running his airline, Lauda Air, on his second Formula One retirement in 1985. He was appointed consultant at Ferrari as part of an effort by Montezemolo to rejuvenate the team. After selling his Lauda Air shares to majority partner Austrian Airlines in 1999, Lauda managed the Jaguar Formula One racing team from 2001 to 2002. In late 2003, he started a new airline, Niki, which was later merged with Air Berlin in 2011.\n\nFilm and television\n\nThe 1976 battle between Lauda and James Hunt was dramatized in the film Rush (2013), where Lauda was played by Daniel Brühl. Lauda made a cameo appearance at the end of the film and praised the film's depiction of the 1976 season.\n\nPersonal life\n\nLauda dated Mariella von Reininghaus until 1975, before marrying the Chilean-Austrian Marlene Knaus in 1976. The couple divorced in 1991, and Lauda had two sons, Mathias and Lukas, with Knaus. In 2008, Lauda married Birgit Wetzinger, a flight attendant for his airline, and the couple had twins, Max and Mia, in 2009.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nLauda died on 20 May 2019 at the age of 70, after a period of ill health exacerbated by his lung injuries from the 1976 accident. He had undergone a double lung transplant the previous year and two kidney transplants in 1997 and 2015. Lauda's legacy as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time continues to inspire new generations of racing fans and drivers.\n\nRacing record\n\nLauda's racing record is marked by his incredible speed, consistency, and determination. He won 20 Grands Prix, achieved 54 pole positions, and scored 18 fastest laps during his Formula One career.\n\nComplete European Formula Two Championship results\n\n| Year | Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5

accident with his fresh burns still bandaged He finished fourth in the Italian GP, despite being, by his own admission, absolutely petrified Formula One journalist Nigel Roebuck recalls seeing Lauda in the pits, peeling the blood-soaked bandages off his scarred scalp He also had to wear a specially adapted crash helmet so as not to be in too much discomfort In Lauda's absence, Hunt had mounted a late charge to reduce Lauda's lead in the World Championship standings Hunt and Lauda were friends away from the circuit, and their personal on-track rivalry, while intense, was cleanly contested and fair Following wins in the Canadian and United States Grands Prix, Hunt stood only three points behind Lauda before the final race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\n\nBrabham and first retirement (1978–1979)\nJoining Parmalat-sponsored Brabham-Alfa Romeo in 1978 for a $1 million salary, Lauda endured two unsuccessful seasons, remembered mainly for his one race in the Brabham BT46B, a radical design known as the Fan Car: it won its first and only race at the Swedish GP, but Brabham did not use the car in Formula One again; other teams vigorously protested the fan car's legality and Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone, who at the time was maneuvering for acquisition of Formula One's commercial rights, did not want to fight a protracted battle over the car, but the victory in Sweden remained official The Brabham BT46 Alfa Romeo flat-12 began the 1978 season at the third race in South Africa It suffered from a variety of troubles that forced Lauda to retire the car 9 out of 14 races Lauda's best results, apart from the wins in Sweden and Italy after the penalization of Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve, were second in Monaco and Great Britain, and a third in the Netherlands.\n\n\nMcLaren comeback, third world title, and second retirement (1982–1985)\nIn 1982, Lauda returned to racing, for an unprecedented $3 million salary [20] After a successful test with McLaren, the only problem was to convince then team sponsor Marlboro that he was still capable of winning Lauda proved he was when, in his third race back, he won the Long Beach Grand Prix Before the opening race of the season at Kyalami race track in South Africa, Lauda was the organiser of the so-called \"drivers' strike\"; Lauda had seen that the new Super Licence required the drivers to commit themselves to their present teams and realised that this could hinder a driver's negotiating position The drivers, with the exception of Teo Fabi, barricaded themselves in a banqueting suite at Sunnyside Park Hotel until they had won the day [21]\n\n\nHelmet\nLauda's helmet was originally painted plain red with his full name written on both sides and the Raiffeisen Bank logo in the chin area He wore a modified AGV helmet in the weeks following his Nürburgring accident so as the lining would not aggravate his burned scalp too badly In 1982, upon his return to McLaren, his helmet was white and featured the red \"L\" logo of Lauda Air instead of his name on both sides, complete with branding from his personal sponsor Parmalat on the top From 1983 to 1985, the red and white were reversed to evoke memories of his earlier helmet design [citation needed]\n\n\nLater management roles\nIn 1993, Lauda returned to Formula One in a managerial position when Luca di Montezemolo offered him a

Brahmin parents, [5] [6] Chandrasekhar Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal [7] He was the second of eight siblings [8] His father was a teacher at a local high school, and earned a modest income He recalled: \"I was born with a copper spoon in my mouth At my birth my father was earning the magnificent salary of ten rupees per month!\" [9] In 1892, his family moved to Visakhapatnam (then Vizagapatam or Vizag) in Andhra Pradesh as his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs A.V Narasimha Rao College [10]\n\n\nCareer\nRaman's elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service), [23] the most prestigious government service in India In no condition to study abroad, Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in the entrance examination in February 1907 [24] He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907 [10] It was there that he became highly impressed with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute founded in India in 1876 [22] He immediately befriended Asutosh Dey, who would eventually become his lifelong collaborator, Amrita Lal Sircar, founder and secretary of IACS, and Ashutosh Mukherjee, executive member of the institute and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta With their support, he obtained permission to conduct research at IACS in his own time even \"at very unusual hours,\" as Raman later reminisced [13] Up to that time the institute had not yet recruited regular researchers, [25] or produced any research paper [10] Raman's article \"Newton's rings in polarised light\" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute [26] The work inspired IACS to publish a journal, Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, in 1909 in which Raman was the major contributor [13]\n\n\nScientific contributions\nOne of Raman's interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds He was inspired by Hermann von Helmholtz's The Sensations of Tone, the book he came across when he joined IACS [24] He published his findings prolifically between 1916 and 1921 He worked out the theory of transverse vibration of bowed string instruments based on superposition of velocities One of his earliest studies was on the wolf tone in violins and cellos [43] [44] He studied the acoustics of various violin and related instruments, including Indian stringed instruments, [45] [46] and water splashes [47] He even performed what he called \"Experiments with mechanically-played violins.\" [48]\n\n\nMusical sound\nOne of Raman's interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds He was inspired

color of the sea\nRaman, in his broadening venture on optics, started to investigate scattering of light starting in 1919 [55] His first phenomenal discovery of the physics of light was the blue color of seawater During a voyage home from England on board the S.S Narkunda in September 1921, he contemplated the blue color of the Mediterranean Sea Using simple optical equipment, a pocket-sized spectroscope and a Nicol prism in hand, he studied the sea water [56] Of several hypotheses on the colour of the sea propounded at the time, [57] [58] the best explanation had been that of Lord Rayleigh's in 1910, according to which, \"The much admired dark blue of the deep sea has nothing to do with the color of water, but is simply the blue of the sky seen by reflection\" [59] Rayleigh had correctly described the nature of the blue sky by a phenomenon now known as Rayleigh scattering, [60] the scattering of light and refraction by particles in the atmosphere [61] His explanation of the blue colour of water was instinctively accepted as correct Raman could view the water using a Nicol prism to avoid the influence of sunlight reflected by the surface He described how the sea appears even more blue than usual, contradicting Rayleigh [62]\n\n\nRaman effect\nRaman's second important discovery on the scattering of light was a new type of radiation, an eponymous phenomenon called the Raman effect [68] After discovering the nature of light scattering that caused blue colour of water, he focused on the principle behind the phenomenon His experiments in 1923 showed the possibility of other light rays formed in addition to the incident ray when sunlight was filtered through a violet glass in certain liquids and solids Ramanathan believed that this was a case of a \"trace of fluorescence.\" [13] In 1925, K S Krishnan, a new Research Associate, noted the theoretical background for the existence of an additional scattering line beside the usual polarised elastic scattering when light scatters through liquid [69] He referred to the phenomenon as \"feeble fluorescence.\" [70] But the theoretical attempts to justify the phenomenon were quite futile for the next two years

experiments\nKrishnan started the experiment in the beginning of January 1928 [63] On 7 January, he discovered that no matter what kind of pure liquid he used, it always produced polarised fluorescence within the visible spectrum of light As Raman saw the result, he was astonished why he never observed such phenomenon all those years [63] That night he and Krishnan named the new phenomenon as \"modified scattering\" with reference to the Compton effect as an unmodified scattering On 16 February, they sent a manuscript to Nature titled \"A new type of secondary radiation\", which was published on 31 March [77]\n\n\nAnnouncement\n\nThe same day, Raman made the announcement before the press The Associated Press of India reported it the next day, on 29 February, as \"New theory of radiation: Prof Raman's Discovery.\" [83] It ran the story as:\n\nReception and outcome\nSome physicists, particularly French and German physicists were initially sceptical of the authenticity of the discovery Georg Joos at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena asked Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, \"Do you think that Raman's work on the optical Compton effect in liquids is reliable?.. The sharpness of the scattered lines in liquids seems doubtful to me\" Sommerfeld then tried to reproduce the experiment, but failed [87] On 20 June 1928, Peter Pringsheim at the University of Berlin was able to reproduce Raman's results successfully He was the first to coin the terms Ramaneffekt and Linien des Ramaneffekts in his articles published the following months [88] [89] Use of the English versions, \"Raman effect\" and \"Raman lines\" immediately followed [90] [22] [91]\n\n\nLater work\nRaman had association with the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi He attended the foundation ceremony of BHU [97] and delivered lectures on mathematics and \"Some new paths in physics\" during the lecture series organised at the university from 5 to 8 February 1916 [98] He also held the position of permanent visiting professor [99]\n\n\nPersonal life\nRaman married Lokasundari Ammal, daughter of S Krishnaswami Iyer who was the Superintendent of Sea Customs at Madras, in 1907 [23] The wedding day is popularly recorded as on 6 May, [122] [123] [124] but Raman's great-niece and biographer, Uma Parameswaran, [125] revealed a factual date of 2 June 1907 [126] It was a self-arranged marriage and his wife was 13 years old [127] [42] [128] (Sources are contradicting on her age as her birth year is specified as 1892, [22] [123] [124] which would make her about 15 years of age; but Parameswaran affirmed the 13-year, [129] corroborated by her obituary in Current Science that mentioned her age as 86 on her death on 22 May 1980 [130]) His wife later jokingly recounted that their marriage was not so much about her musical prowess (she was playing veena when they first met) as \"the extra allowance which the Finance Department gave to its married officers.\" [42] The extra allowance refers to an additional INR 150 for married officers at the time [23] Soon after they moved to Calcutta in 1907, the couple were accused of converting to Christianity It was because they frequently visited St John's Church, Kolkata as Lokasundari was fascinated with the church music and Raman with the acoustics [42]\n\n\nReligious views\n\nAlthough Raman hardly talked about religion, he was openly an agnostic, [140] but objected to being labelled atheist [21] His agnosticism was largely influenced by that of his father who adhered to the philosophies of Herbert Spencer, Charles Bradlaugh, and Robert G Ingersoll [141] He resented Hindu traditional rituals [142] but did not give them up in family circles [143] [144] He was also influenced by the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta [145] Traditional pagri (Indian turban) with a tuft underneath and a upanayana (Hindu sacred thread) were his signature attire Though it was not customary to wear turbans in South Indian culture, he explained his habit as, \"Oh, if I did not wear one, my head will swell You all praise me so much and I need a turban to contain my ego.\" [24] He even attributed his turban for the recognition he received on his first visit to England, particular from J J Thomson and Lord Rutherford [42] In a public speech, he once said,\n\nDeath\nAt the end of October 1970, Raman had a cardiac arrest and collapsed in his laboratory He was moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not survive for another four hours [147] He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers and fans [148]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 1928, Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam at the Moscow State University independently discovered the Raman effect They published their findings in July issue of Naturwissenschaften, [150] and presented their findings at the Sixth Congress of the Russian Association of Physicists held at Saratov between 5 and 16 August [151] In 1930, they were nominated for the Nobel Prize alongside Raman According to the Nobel Committee, however: (1) the Russians did not come to an independent interpretation of their discovery as they cited Raman's article; (2) they observed the effect only in crystals, whereas Raman and Krishnan observed it in solids, liquids and gases, and therefore proved the universal nature of the effect; (3) the problems concerning the intensity of Raman and infrared lines in the spectra had been explained during the previous year; (4) the Raman method had been applied with great success in different fields of molecular physics; and (5) the Raman effect had effectively helped to check the symmetry properties of molecules, and thus the problems concerning nuclear spin in atomic physics [152]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize\nIn 1928, Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam at the Moscow State University independently discovered the Raman

Krishnan\nKrishnan was not nominated for the Nobel Prize even though he was the main researcher in the discovery of Raman effect [87] It was he alone who first noted the new scattering [63] Krishnan co-authored all the scientific papers on the discovery in 1928 except two He alone wrote all the follow-up studies [155] [156] [157] Krishnan himself never claimed himself worthy of the prize [158] But Raman admitted later that Krishnan was the co-discoverer [87] He however remained openly antagonistic towards Krishnan, which the latter described as \"the greatest tragedy of my life.\" [158] After Krishnan's death, Raman said to a correspondent from The Times of India, \"Krishnan was the greatest charlatan I have known, and all his life he masqueraded in the cloak of another man's discovery.\" [159]\n\n\nThe Raman–Born controversy\nDuring October 1933 to March 1934, Max Born was employed by IISc as Reader in Theoretical Physics following the invitation by Raman early in 1933 [160] Born at the time was a refugee from Nazi Germany and temporarily employed at St John's College, Cambridge [161] Since the beginning of the 20th century Born had developed a theory on lattice dynamics based on thermal properties [162] He presented his theory in one of his lectures at IISc By then Raman had developed a different theory and claimed that Born's theory contradicted the experimental data [160] Their debate lasted for decades [163] [164]\n\n\nIndian authorities\nRaman had an aversion to the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and Nehru's policies on science In one instance he smashed the bust of Nehru on the floor In another he shattered his Bharat Ratna medallion to pieces with a hammer, as it was given to him by the Nehru government [169] [170] He publicly ridiculed Nehru when the latter visited the Raman Research Institute in 1948 There they displayed a piece of gold and copper against an ultraviolet light Nehru was tricked into believing that copper which glowed more brilliantly than any other metal was gold Raman was quick to remark, \"Mr Prime Minister, everything that glitters is not gold.\" [171]\n\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences\nThe Indian Academy of Sciences was born out of conflicts during the procedures of proposal for a national scientific organisation in line with the Royal Society [176] In 1933, the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), at the time the largest scientific organisation, planned to establish a national science body, which would be authorised to advise the government on scientific matters [177] Sir Richard Gregory, then editor of Nature, on his visit to India had suggested Raman, as editor of Current Science, to establish an Indian Academy of Sciences Raman was of the opinion that it should be an exclusively Indian membership as opposed to the general consensus that British members should be included He resolved that \"How can India Science prosper under the tutelage of an academy which has its own council of 30, 15 of who are Britishers of whom only two or three are fit enough to be its Fellows.\" On 1 April 1933, he convened a separate meeting of the south Indian scientists He and Subba Rao officially resigned from ISCA [178]\n\n\nIndian Institute of Science\nRaman had a great fallout with the authorities at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) He was accused of biased development in physics, while ignoring other fields [160] He lacked diplomatic personality on other colleagues, which S Ramaseshan, his nephew and later Director of IISc, reminisced, saying, \"Raman went in there like a bull in a china shop.\" [142] He wanted research in physics at the level of those of western institutes, but at the expense of other fields of science [160] Max Born observed, \"Raman found a sleepy place where very little work was being done by a number of extremely well paid people.\" [142] At the Council meeting, Kenneth Aston, professor in the Electrical Technology Department, harshly criticised Raman and Raman's recruitment of Born Raman had every intention of giving full position of professor to Born [24] Aston even made personal attack on Born by referring to him as someone \"who was rejected by his own country, a renegade and therefore a second-rate scientist unfit to be part of the faculty, much less to be the head of the department of physics.\" [179]\n\n\nThe Royal Society\nRaman never seemed to have thought highly of the Fellowship of the Royal Society [136] He tendered his resignation as a Fellow on 9 March 1968, which the Council of the Royal Society accepted on 4 April However, the exact reason was not documented [181] One reason could be Raman's objection to the designation \"British subjects\" as one of the categories of the Fellows Particularly after the Independence of India, the Royal Society had its own disputes on this matter [182]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nRaman was honoured with many honorary doctorates and memberships of scientific societies Within India, apart from being the founder and President of the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc), [184] he was a Fellow of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (FASB), [185] and from 1943, a Foundation Fellow of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (FIAS) [186] In 1935, he was appointed a Foundation Fellow of the National Institute of Sciences of India (FNI, now the Indian National Science Academy [185] [n 1] [n 2] He was a member of the Deutsche Akademie of Munich, the Swiss Physical Society of Zürich, the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, the Royal Irish Academy, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Optical Society of America (Honorary Member), the Mineralogical Society of America, the Romanian Academy of Sciences, the Catgut Acoustical Society of America and the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences [189]\n\n\nAwards\nAt this institute, Sir C V Raman discovered in 1928 that when a beam

V. Raman**\n\nC. V. Raman was a renowned Indian physicist who made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of spectroscopy, molecular physics, and optical physics. He is best known for his discovery of the Raman effect, which is a phenomenon in which the frequency of light is shifted when it is scattered by a molecule.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nC. V. Raman was born on November 7, 1888, in Tiruchirappalli, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. He was the second of eight children born to Chandrasekhar Ramanathan Iyer and Parvathi Ammal. His father was a teacher at a local high school and earned a modest income. Raman's family moved to Visakhapatnam in 1892 when his father was appointed to the faculty of physics at Mrs. A.V Narasimha Rao College.\n\nRaman's early education was at the Presidency College in Chennai, where he graduated with a degree in physics in 1907. He was an excellent student and achieved first position in the entrance examination for the Indian Finance Service. He was posted in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907 and became interested in research in physics.\n\n**Career**\n\nRaman's interest in research in physics led him to become highly impressed with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute founded in India in 1876. He befriended Asutosh Dey, Amrita Lal Sircar, and Ashutosh Mukherjee, who were all associated with the institute. With their support, he obtained permission to conduct research at IACS in his own time, even at unusual hours.\n\nRaman's article \"Newton's rings in polarised light\" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute. His work inspired IACS to publish a journal, Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, in 1909, in which Raman was the major contributor.\n\n**Scientific Contributions**\n\nOne of Raman's interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds. He was inspired by Hermann von Helmholtz's The Sensations of Tone, which he came across when he joined IACS. He published his findings prolifically between 1916 and 1921 and worked out the theory of transverse vibration of bowed string instruments based on superposition of velocities. His earliest study was on the wolf tone in violins and cellos.\n\nRaman also studied the acoustics of various violin and related instruments, including Indian stringed instruments, and water splashes. He even performed experiments with mechanically-played violins.\n\n**Blue Color of the Sea**\n\nRaman's broadening venture on optics started in 1919, when he investigated the scattering of light.

English versions, \"Raman effect\" and \"Raman lines\" immediately followed [90] [22] [91]\n\n\nLater work\nRaman had association with the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi He attended the foundation ceremony of BHU [97] and delivered lectures on mathematics and \"Some new paths in physics\" during the lecture series organised at the university from 5 to 8 February 1916 [98] He also held the position of permanent visiting professor [99]\n\n\nPersonal life\nRaman married Lokasundari Ammal, daughter of S Krishnaswami Iyer who was the Superintendent of Sea Customs at Madras, in 1907 [23] The wedding day is popularly recorded as on 6 May, [122] [123] [124] but Raman's great-niece and biographer, Uma Parameswaran, [125] revealed a factual date of 2 June 1907 [126] It was a self-arranged marriage and his wife was 13 years old [127] [42] [128] (Sources are contradicting on her age as her birth year is specified as 1892, [22] [123] [124] which would make her about 15 years of age; but Parameswaran affirmed the 13-year, [129] corroborated by her obituary in Current Science that mentioned her age as 86 on her death on 22 May 1980 [130]) His wife later jokingly recounted that their marriage was not so much about her musical prowess (she was playing veena when they first met) as \"the extra allowance which the Finance Department gave to its married officers.\" [42] The extra allowance refers to an additional INR 150 for married officers at the time [23] Soon after they moved to Calcutta in 1907, the couple were accused of converting to Christianity It was because they frequently visited St John's Church, Kolkata as Lokasundari was fascinated with the church music and Raman with the acoustics [42]\n\n\nReligious views\n\nAlthough Raman hardly talked about religion, he was openly an agnostic, [140] but objected to being labelled atheist [21] His agnosticism was largely influenced by that of his father who adhered to the philosophies of Herbert Spencer, Charles Bradlaugh, and Robert G Ingersoll [141] He resented Hindu traditional rituals [142] but did not give them up in family circles [143] [144] He was also influenced by the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta [145] Traditional pagri (Indian turban) with a tuft underneath and a upanayana (Hindu sacred thread) were his signature attire Though it was not customary to wear turbans in South Indian culture, he explained his habit as, \"Oh, if I did not wear one, my head will swell You all praise me so much and I need a turban to contain my ego.\" [24] He even attributed his turban for the recognition he received on his first visit to England, particular from J J Thomson and Lord Rutherford [42] In a public speech, he once said,\n\nDeath\nAt the end of October 1970, Raman had a cardiac arrest and collapsed in his laboratory He was moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not survive for another four hours [147] He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers and fans [148]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 1928, Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam at the Moscow State University independently discovered the Raman effect They published their findings in July issue of Naturwissenschaften, [150] and presented their findings at the Sixth Congress of the Russian Association of Physicists held at Saratov between 5 and 16 August [151] In 1930, they were nominated for the Nobel Prize alongside Raman According to the Nobel Committee, however: (1) the Russians did not come to an independent interpretation of their discovery as they cited Raman's article; (2) they observed the effect only in crystals, whereas Raman and Krishnan observed it in solids, liquids and gases, and therefore proved the universal nature of the effect; (3) the problems concerning the intensity of Raman and infrared lines in the spectra had been explained during the previous year; (4) the Raman method had been applied with great success in different fields of molecular physics; and (5) the Raman effect had effectively helped to check the symmetry properties of molecules, and thus the problems concerning nuclear spin in atomic physics [152]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize\nIn 1928, Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam at the Moscow State University independently discovered the Raman

July issue of Naturwissenschaften, [150] and presented their findings at the Sixth Congress of the Russian Association of Physicists held at Saratov between 5 and 16 August [151] In 1930, they were

molecular physics; and (5) the Raman effect had effectively helped to check the symmetry properties of molecules, and thus the problems concerning nuclear spin in atomic physics [152]\n\n\nRole of Krishnan\nKrishnan was not nominated for the Nobel Prize even though he was the main researcher in the discovery of Raman effect [87] It was he alone who first noted the new scattering [63] Krishnan co-authored all the scientific papers on the discovery in 1928 except two He alone wrote all the follow-up studies [155] [156] [157] Krishnan himself never claimed himself worthy of the prize [158] But Raman admitted later that Krishnan was the co-discoverer [87] He however remained openly antagonistic towards Krishnan, which the latter described as \"the greatest tragedy of my life.\" [158] After Krishnan's death, Raman said to a correspondent from The Times of India, \"Krishnan was the greatest charlatan I have known, and all his life he masqueraded in the cloak of another man's discovery.\" [159]\n\n\nThe Raman–Born controversy\nDuring October 1933 to March 1934, Max Born was employed by IISc as Reader in Theoretical Physics following the invitation by Raman early in 1933 [160] Born at the time was a refugee from Nazi Germany and temporarily employed at St John's College, Cambridge [161] Since the beginning of the 20th century Born had developed a theory on lattice dynamics based on thermal properties [162] He presented his theory in one of his lectures at IISc By then Raman had developed a different theory and claimed that Born's theory contradicted the experimental data [160] Their debate lasted for decades [163] [164]\n\n\nIndian authorities\nRaman had an aversion to the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru and Nehru's policies on science In one instance he smashed the bust of Nehru on the floor In another he shattered his Bharat Ratna medallion to pieces with a hammer, as it was given to him by the Nehru government [169] [170] He publicly ridiculed Nehru when the latter visited the Raman Research Institute in 1948 There they displayed a piece of gold and copper against an ultraviolet light Nehru was tricked into believing that copper which glowed more brilliantly than any other metal was gold Raman was quick to remark, \"Mr Prime Minister, everything that glitters is not gold.\" [171]\n\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences\nThe Indian Academy of Sciences was born out of conflicts during the procedures of proposal for a national scientific organisation in line with the Royal Society [176] In 1933, the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), at the time the largest scientific organisation, planned to establish a national science body, which would be authorised to advise the government on scientific matters [177] Sir Richard Gregory, then editor of Nature, on his visit to India had suggested Raman, as editor of Current Science, to establish an Indian Academy of Sciences Raman was of the opinion that it should be an exclusively Indian membership as opposed to the general consensus that British members should be included He resolved that \"How can India Science prosper under the tutelage of an academy which has its own council of 30, 15 of who are Britishers of whom only two or three are fit enough to be its Fellows.\" On 1 April 1933, he convened a separate meeting of the south Indian scientists He and Subba Rao officially resigned from ISCA [178]\n\n\nIndian Institute of Science\nRaman had a great fallout with the authorities at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) He was accused of biased development in physics, while ignoring other fields [160] He lacked diplomatic personality on other colleagues, which S Ramaseshan, his nephew and later Director of IISc, reminisced, saying, \"Raman went in there like a bull in a china shop.\" [142] He wanted research in physics at the level of those of western institutes, but at the expense of other fields of science [160] Max Born observed, \"Raman found a sleepy place where very little work was being done by a number of extremely well paid people.\" [142] At the Council meeting, Kenneth Aston, professor in the Electrical Technology Department, harshly criticised Raman and Raman's recruitment of Born Raman had every intention of giving full position of professor to Born [24] Aston even made personal attack on Born by referring to him as someone \"who was rejected by his own country, a renegade and therefore a second-rate scientist unfit to be part of the faculty, much less to be the head of the department of physics.\" [179]\n\n\nThe Royal Society\nRaman never seemed to have thought highly of the Fellowship of the Royal Society [136] He tendered his resignation as a Fellow on 9 March 1968, which the Council of the Royal Society accepted on 4 April However, the exact reason was not documented [181] One reason could be Raman's objection to the designation \"British subjects\" as one of the categories of the Fellows Particularly after the Independence of India, the Royal Society had its own disputes on this matter [182]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nRaman was honoured with many honorary doctorates and memberships of scientific societies Within India, apart from being the founder and President of the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc), [184] he was a Fellow of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (FASB), [185] and from 1943, a Foundation Fellow of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (FIAS) [186] In 1935, he was appointed a Foundation Fellow of the National Institute of Sciences of India (FNI, now the Indian National Science Academy [185] [n 1] [n 2] He was a member of the Deutsche Akademie of Munich, the Swiss Physical Society of Zürich, the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, the Royal Irish Academy, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Optical Society of America (Honorary Member), the Mineralogical Society of America, the Romanian Academy of Sciences, the Catgut Acoustical Society of America and the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences [189]\n\n\nAwards\nAt this institute, Sir C V Raman discovered in 1928 that when a beam of coloured light entered a liquid, a fraction of the light scattered by that liquid was of a different color Raman showed that the nature of this scattered light was dependent on the type of sample present Other scientists quickly understood the significance of this phenomenon as an analytical and research tool and called it the Raman Effect This method became even more valuable with the advent of modern computers and lasers Its current uses range from the non-destructive identification of minerals to the early detection of life-threatening diseases For his discovery Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 [34]\n\nPosthumous recognition and contemporary references\nAt this institute, Sir C V Raman discovered in 1928 that when a beam of coloured light entered a liquid, a

{"title": "Mother's_Day", "content": "\nEstablishment of holiday\nThe modern holiday was first celebrated in 1907, when Anna Jarvis held the first Mother's Day service of worship at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia [1] [13] Andrew's Methodist Church now holds the International Mother's Day Shrine [1] Her campaign to make Mother's Day a recognized holiday in the United States began in 1905, the year her mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, died Ann Jarvis had been a peace activist who cared for wounded soldiers on both sides of the American Civil War, and created Mother's Day Work Clubs to address public health issues She and another peace activist and suffragist, Julia Ward Howe, had been urging for the creation of a \"Mother's Day For Peace\" where mothers would ask that their husbands and sons were no longer killed in wars Forty years before it became an official holiday, Ward Howe had made her Mother's Day Proclamation in 1870, which called upon mothers of all nationalities to band together to promote the \"amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.\" [14] Anna Jarvis wanted to honor this and to set aside a day to honor all mothers because she believed a mother is \"the person who has done more for you than anyone in the world\" [15]\n\n\nSpelling\nIn 1912, Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrase \"Second Sunday in May, Mother's Day, Anna Jarvis, Founder\", and created the Mother's Day International Association [26] She specifically noted that \"Mother's\" should \"be a singular possessive, for each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world.\" [27] This is also the spelling used by U.S President Woodrow Wilson in his 1914 presidential proclamation, by the U.S Congress in relevant bills, [28] [29] and by various U.S presidents in their proclamations concerning Mother's Day [30]\n\n\nDates around the world\nWhile the United States holiday was adopted by some other countries, existing celebrations, held on different dates, honoring motherhood have become described as \"Mother's Day\", such as Mothering Sunday in the United Kingdom [31] or, in Greece, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of the presentation of Jesus Christ to the temple (2 February of Julian Calendar) Both the secular and religious Mother Day are present in Greece [32] Mothering Sunday is often referred to as \"Mother's Day\" even though it is an unrelated celebration [31]\n\n\nInternational history and tradition\nIn most countries, Mother's Day is an observance derived from the holiday as it has evolved in the United States, promoted by companies who saw benefit in making it popular [9] As adopted by other countries and cultures, the holiday has different meanings, is associated with different events (religious, historical or legendary), and is celebrated on different dates.\n\n\nReligion\nIn certain traditional branches of Christianity, the holiday is strongly associated with revering the Virgin Mary [62] In some Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican homes, families have a special shrine on their home altar devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary [63] In many Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, a special prayer service is held in honor of the Theotokos Virgin Mary [64] [65]\n\n\nBy country\nIn Albania, as in a number of Balkan and Eastern European countries, Mother's Day is celebrated on 8 March, in conjunction with International Women's Day [69]\n\n\nAlbania\nIn Albania, as in a number of Balkan and Eastern European countries,

until the 1920s [73] [74] Because it is autumn in Australia for Mother’s Day, and carnations are a spring flower, white chrysanthemums are the traditional Mother’s Day flower in Australia [75]\n\n\nBangladesh\nThere is no historical tradition of celebrating Mother's Day in Bangladesh (Bangla: মা/আম্মু দিবস, Ma/ammu dibosh), and it has become popular in the country due to western influences It is celebrated on the second Sunday of May and is not a public holiday Mother's Day was not very popular and in recent times it has been spread more widely by the Millennial and Generation Z communities across the country through social media Although many religious families do not celebrate it, it is more widespread than ever before There is a popular phrase used by many parents, including mothers, which is \"Every day is Father's/Mother's Day so you will love your parents every day.\" Most people just wish or pray for their mother, but many from big cities like Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Barishal, Narayangonj, Bogura etc go to restaurants to celebrate, many also cut cakes Many others cut cakes at home or order meals online Some children may give small gifts to their mothers.\n\n\nBelarus\nBelarus celebrates Mother's Day on 14 October Like other ex-Communist republics, Belarus used to celebrate only International Women's Day on 8 March

she is still in bed – the beginning of a day of pampering for the mother There are also many people who celebrate Mother's Day on 15 August instead; these are mostly people around Antwerp, who consider that day (Assumption) the classical Mother's Day and the observance in May an invention for commercial reasons It was originally established on that day as the result of a campaign by Frans Van Kuyck, a painter and Alderman from Antwerp [78]\n\n\nBolivia\nIn Bolivia, Mother's Day is celebrated on 27 May El Día de la Madre Boliviana was passed into law on 8 November 1927, during the

[81]\n\n\nChina\nMother's Day is becoming more popular in China Carnations are a very popular Mother's Day gift and the most sold flowers in relation to the day [82] In 1997 Mother's Day was set as the day to help poor mothers and to remind people of the poor mothers in rural areas such as China's western region [82] In the People's Daily, the Chinese government's official newspaper, an article explained that \"despite originating in the United States, people in China accept the holiday without hesitation because it is in line with the country's traditional ethics – respect for the elderly and filial piety towards parents.\" [82]\n\n\nCosta Rica\nIn Costa Rica, Mother's Day is celebrated on 15 August In 1927, at the Nicolás Ulloa School in Heredia, Evangelina Solís founded an annual event that would celebrate the mothers of the students It was held around the time of the distribution of midterm notes, in July Evangelina's reasoning was that mothers should be congratulated for their children's successes [86] The event gained national traction and was enacted into law in 1932 The final date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the celebration of Assumption of Mary, mother of Jesus [87]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nIn the Czech Republic, Mother's Day is celebrated every second Sunday in May It started in former Czechoslovakia in 1923 [47] The promoter of this celebration

first day of spring in the northern hemisphere It was introduced in Egypt by journalist Mustafa Amin [70] in his book Smiling America (1943) The idea was overlooked at the time Later Amin heard the story of a widowed mother who devoted her whole life to raising her son until he became a doctor The son then married and left without showing any gratitude to his mother Hearing this, Amin became

mothers of large families [96] In 1906 ten mothers who had nine children each were given an award recognising \"High Maternal Merit\" (\"Haut mérite maternel\") [97] American World War I soldiers fighting in France popularized the US Mother's Day holiday created by Anna Jarvis They sent so much mail back to their country for Mother's Day that the Union Franco-Américaine created a postal card for that purpose [96] In 1918, also inspired by Jarvis, the town of Lyon wanted to celebrate a \"journée des Mères\", but instead decided to celebrate a \"Journée Nationale des Mères de familles nombreuses.\" The holiday was more inspired by anti-depopulation efforts than by the US holiday, with medals awarded to the mothers of large families [96] The French government made the day official

trend was continuing This was attributed to women's participation in the labor market At the same time, influential groups in society (politicians of left and right, churchwomen, and feminists) believed that mothers should be honored but could not agree on how to do so However, all groups strongly agreed on the promotion of the values of motherhood In 1923, this resulted in the unanimous adoption of Muttertag, the Mother's Day holiday as imported from America [101] The head of the Association of German Florists cited \"the inner conflict of our Volk and the loosening of the family\" as his reason for introducing the holiday He expected that the holiday would unite the divided country In 1925, the Mother's Day Committee joined the task force for the recovery of the volk, and the

and motherhood, celebrated on various dates in many countries around the world. The holiday has a long and varied history, with different cultures and countries celebrating it in different ways.\n\n**Establishment of holiday**\n\nThe modern holiday was first celebrated in 1907, when Anna Jarvis held the first Mother's Day service of worship at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia. Her campaign to make Mother's Day a recognized holiday in the United States began in 1905, the year her mother, Ann Reeves Jarvis, died. Ann Jarvis had been a peace activist who cared for wounded soldiers on both sides of the American Civil War, and created Mother's Day Work Clubs to address public health issues. Julia Ward Howe, a peace activist and suffragist, had also made her Mother's Day Proclamation in 1870, calling upon mothers of all nationalities to band together to promote the \"amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.\"\n\n**Spelling**\n\nIn 1912, Anna Jarvis trademarked the phrase \"Second Sunday in May, Mother's Day, Anna Jarvis, Founder,\" and created the Mother's Day International Association. She specifically noted that \"Mother's\" should \"be a singular possessive, for each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive commemorating all mothers in the world.\" This spelling was also used by U.S President Woodrow Wilson in his 1914 presidential proclamation, by the U.S Congress in relevant bills, and by various U.S presidents in their proclamations concerning Mother's Day.\n\n**Dates around the world**\n\nWhile the United States holiday was adopted by some other countries, existing celebrations, held on different dates, honoring motherhood have become described as \"Mother's Day.\" For example, in the United Kingdom, Mothering Sunday is celebrated on the fourth Sunday in Lent, and in Greece, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of the presentation of Jesus Christ to the temple is celebrated on 2 February of the Julian Calendar.

her Mother's Day Proclamation in 1870, which called upon mothers of all nationalities to band together to promote the \"amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests

August instead; these are mostly people around Antwerp, who consider that day (Assumption) the classical Mother's Day and the observance in May an invention for commercial reasons It was originally established on that day as the result of a campaign by Frans Van Kuyck, a painter and Alderman from Antwerp [78]\n\n\nBolivia\nIn Bolivia, Mother's Day is celebrated on 27 May El Día de la Madre

without showing any gratitude to his mother Hearing this, Amin became motivated to promote \"Mother's Day\" The idea was first ridiculed by president Gamal Abdel Nasser but he eventually accepted it

(\"Haut mérite maternel\") [97] American World War I soldiers fighting in France popularized the US Mother's Day holiday created by Anna Jarvis They sent so much mail back to their country for Mother's Day that the Union Franco-Américaine created a postal card for that purpose [96] In 1918, also inspired by Jarvis, the town of Lyon wanted to celebrate a \"journée des Mères\", but instead decided to celebrate a \"Journée Nationale des Mères de familles nombreuses.\" The holiday was more inspired by anti-depopulation efforts than by the US holiday, with medals awarded to the mothers of

(politicians of left and right, churchwomen, and feminists) believed that mothers should be honored but could not agree on how to do so However, all groups strongly agreed on the promotion of the values of motherhood In 1923, this resulted in the unanimous adoption of Muttertag, the Mother's Day holiday as imported from America [101] The head of the Association of German Florists cited \"the inner conflict of our Volk and the loosening of the family\" as his reason for introducing the holiday He expected that the holiday would unite the divided country In 1925, the Mother's Day Committee

He was born with a rare condition that left him with a height of approximately 18 or 19 inches, and his unique appearance and abilities made him a beloved and infamous figure at the royal courts of Europe.\n\n**Early Life and Rise to Prominence**\n\nJeffrey Hudson was baptized in Oakham, Rutland, on June 14, 1619. He was the son of John Hudson, who was the keeper of the baiting bulls for George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. Hudson's parents, three brothers, and a half-sister were all of average size, and his remarkable smallness and normal proportions became apparent in early childhood. Various theories existed for his size, including the possibility that his mother choked on a gherkin while pregnant, but it is likely that he had a growth hormone deficiency caused by a pituitary gland disorder.\n\nAs a child, Hudson's unique appearance made him a curiosity, and he was often the center of attention. He was known for his wit, courtly behavior, and ability to entertain with his appearance. Hudson's size was repeatedly described as 18 or 19 inches, and he was reported to have grown little between 7 and 30 years of age. His size was not uncommon among court jesters, but his proportions and tiny size made him uniquely famous.\n\n**Hudson at the Queen's Court**\n\nIn late 1626, Hudson moved into Denmark House in London, where the Queen maintained her royal household. The Queen's court was a hub of activity, with many French attendants and Catholic priests. Hudson was one of several natural curiosities and pets, including a giant Welsh porter named William Evans, two disproportionate dwarves, and a monkey called Pug. Hudson developed a routine with Evans in which the porter pulled Hudson out of his pocket along with a loaf of bread and proceeded to make a sandwich.\n\nAs Hudson matured, he learned to amuse and entertain with his wit, courtly behavior, and appearance. He was often cast in picturesque roles in the elaborate costumed masques that were staged by Inigo Jones for the amusement of the court. Dwarves were not rare in the courts of Europe, but Hudson's proportions and tiny size made him uniquely famous.\n\n**The Coming of the Civil War and the Dissolution of the Court**\n\nBy 1640, the relationship between King Charles and the Parliament had deteriorated to plots and attempted arrests. Armed conflict broke out between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians in 1642, and Charles led the Royalist army. The Queen took a small number of her retinue, including Hudson, to the Netherlands to raise money and support for Charles. She sold articles from her palace and raised enough to buy some supplies for the Royalist army but was unsuccessful in obtaining official support from the Protestant Dutch government.\n\nShe returned to England with her courtiers, and they found themselves in the middle of a civil war. Royalist courtiers collected around the Queen, but Hudson had no interest in resuming his role of pet or clown and let it be known he would suffer no more jokes or insults.\n\n**Duel and Disaster**\n\nThere is no record of the precise offense offered, but in October 1644, Hudson challenged the brother of William Crofts to a duel. Crofts arrived at the duel brandishing a large water squirt, but his flippancy would lead to his death, as Hudson fatally shot him in the forehead. Crofts's death was a disaster for Hudson, as duelling had been outlawed in France, and this could be considered a transgression against hospitality, in addition to the fact that William Crofts was a powerful figure as the Queen's Master of Horse and head of her lifeguard.\n\nHudson was initially sentenced to death, but Henrietta Maria interceded for his life, and he was sent back to England.\n\n**Slavery and Redemption, Poverty and Death**\n\nHudson's movements after leaving the Queen's court in late 1644, aged 25 years, are unknown. Within months, he was on a ship captured by Barbary pirates. Hudson was enslaved in North Africa, where he spent perhaps his next 25 years labouring. The date and circumstances of his rescue or redemption are not known.\n\nIn the 1660s, several missions were sent from England to Algeria and Tunis to ransom English captives, and his first documented presence back in England was in 1669. No details of his captivity were recorded except one fact: he claimed to have grown to 45 inches during this time, doubling his height after 30 years of age, which he attributed to the hardships he had suffered.\n\nHudson's later life was marked by poverty and hardship. He struggled to make a living and was often in debt. He died in poverty and obscurity, a far cry from the famous court jester he had once been.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Inigo Jones\n* Henrietta Maria\n* George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham\n* William Crofts\n* Barbary pirates\n\n**Notes**\n\nJeffrey Hudson's life was marked by controversy and tragedy. His unique appearance and abilities made him a beloved and infamous figure at the royal courts of Europe, but his involvement in the duel and his subsequent enslavement left him a broken and impoverished man. Despite his hardships, Hudson remained a fascinating figure, and his legacy continues to captivate historians and the public alike.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jeffrey_Hudson\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and rise to prominence\nHudson was baptised in Oakham in Rutland on 14 June 1619 His parents, three brothers, and a half-sister were all of average size Hudson's father, John, was keeper of the baiting bulls for George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham Hudson's marvellous smallness and normal proportions became apparent in early childhood Various theories existed for his size, including that his mother choked on a gherkin while pregnant, but he probably had a growth hormone deficiency caused by a pituitary gland disorder [1]\n\n\nHudson at the Queen's court\nHudson moved into Denmark House in London in late 1626, where the Queen maintained her royal household, with its many French attendants and Catholic priests He was one of several natural curiosities and pets, among whom were a giant Welsh porter named William Evans, two disproportionate dwarves, and a monkey called Pug He later developed a routine with Evans in which the porter pulled Hudson out of his pocket along with a loaf of bread and proceeded to make a sandwich As he matured, Hudson learned to amuse and entertain with his wit, courtly behaviour, and appearance Dwarves were not rare in the courts of Europe, but Hudson's proportions and tiny size made him uniquely famous His size was repeatedly described as 18 or 19 inches, and he was reported to have grown little between 7 and 30 years of age He was often cast in picturesque roles in the elaborate costumed masques which were staged by Inigo Jones for the amusement of the court [2]\n\n\nThe coming of the Civil War and the dissolution of the court\nBy 1640, the relationship between King Charles and the Parliament had deteriorated to plots and attempted arrests Armed conflict broke out between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians in 1642 As Charles led the Royalist army, the Queen took a small number of her retinue, including Hudson, to the Netherlands to raise money and support for him By selling articles from her palace, she raised enough to buy some supplies for the Royalist army but was unsuccessful in obtaining official support from the Protestant Dutch government She returned to England with her courtiers, and they found themselves in the middle of a civil war.\n\n\nDuel and disaster\nRoyalist courtiers collected around the Queen, but Hudson had no interest in resuming his role of pet or clown and let it be known he would suffer no more jokes or insults There is no record of the precise offence offered, but in October 1644, Hudson challenged the brother of William Crofts to a duel Crofts arrived at the duel brandishing a large water squirt, [6] [nb 1] but his flippancy would lead to his death, as Hudson fatally shot him in the forehead Crofts's death was a disaster for Hudson Duelling had been outlawed in France, and this could be considered a transgression against hospitality, in addition to the fact that William Crofts was a powerful figure as the Queen's Master of Horse and head of her lifeguard Hudson was initially sentenced to death, but Henrietta Maria interceded for his life, and he was sent back to England [8]\n\n\nSlavery and redemption, poverty and death\nHudson's movements after leaving the Queen's court in late 1644, aged 25 years, are unknown Within months, he was on a ship captured by Barbary pirates Hudson was enslaved in North Africa, where he spent perhaps his next 25 years labouring The date and circumstances of his rescue or redemption are not known In the 1660s, several missions were sent from England to Algeria and Tunis to ransom English captives, and his first documented presence back in England was in 1669 No details of his captivity were recorded except one fact: he claimed to have grown to 45 inches (110 centimetres) during this time, doubling his height after 30 years of age, [9] which he attributed to the hardships he had suffered [10]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Boeing 737-524 aircraft, registered as PK-CLC, was bound for Pontianak, West Kalimantan, with 62 people on board.\n\nBackground\nThe aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-524, registered as PK-CLC (c/n 27323, Line no.2616). It was equipped with two CFM International CFM56-3B1 engines. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had accumulated 62,983 hours and 40,383 cycles.\n\nAircraft\nThe aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-524, registered as PK-CLC (c/n 27323, Line no.2616). It was equipped with two CFM International CFM56-3B1 engines. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had accumulated 62,983 hours and 40,383 cycles.\n\nPassengers and crew\nThere were 62 people on board, of which 50 were revenue passengers (43 adults and 7 children). Of the 12 crew members, six were operating crew on the flight, while the other six were deadheading as passengers. The majority of the passengers were residents from West Kalimantan.\n\nFlight timeline\nFlight 182 was scheduled to depart from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 13:40 WIB (06:40 UTC), and to arrive at Supadio International Airport in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, at 15:00 WIB (08:00 UTC). Departure was delayed by monsoon rains, and Flight 182 took off from runway 25R at 14:36 local time (07:36 UTC). Due to the delay, it was expected to land in Pontianak at 15:50 WIB (08:50 UTC).\n\nSearch and recovery\nThe crash site was located 11 nmi (20 km) from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.\n\nInvestigation\nThe NTSC was immediately notified of the accident, with assistance from BASARNAS. NTSC stated that starting on 10 January 2021, just before 06:00 local time, search and rescue personnel would start searching for the aircraft's flight recorders. It added that the investigation will be assisted by the United States' National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), with the Singaporean Transport Safety Investigation Bureau also offering assistance with the investigation. On 10 January, NTSC obtained raw data of the aircraft's flight path from radar and interviews with the air traffic controller. Investigators also retrieved the transcript of communications between the pilots and ATC.\n\nMaintenance issue\nAccording to Tempo magazine, sources close to the investigation committee revealed that the aircraft involved in the accident had a recurring autothrottle problem for at least a month. NTSC, however, stated that they did not have the maintenance data yet. According to a person familiar with the investigation, \"the autothrottle was producing more thrust in one of the two jet engines\" during the flight. If pilots did not set the power manually, \"an aircraft could turn to the side or even make an abrupt descent.\" On 22 January it was revealed that a malfunction of the autothrottle system had been reported several days before the flight; the aircraft can fly without the system, however, as the pilot can set the throttles manually.\n\nThrust asymmetry\nIn most airliners, a thrust asymmetry would be detected by the aircraft's safety system, which would have immediately deactivated the autothrottle, but the accident aircraft's system did not operate correctly.\n\nPilot error\nEven though the aircraft had difficulties with the autothrottle system, this alone was not severe enough to cause the crash, as pilots are supposed to have been trained to handle these kinds of situations. The thrust asymmetry that occurred on board was a subtle but progressive failure that should be noticed by pilots, as there was enough time for the pilots to be aware of the evolving situation. The aircraft also should not have entered an upset condition. Other than the autothrottle and systems related to the aircraft's automation, the maintenance logbook indicated that there were no known defects on the other vital components such as the attitude indicator.\n\nSafety culture\nWhile there were some shortcomings in Captain Afwan's personal skill as a pilot, the investigation into the training of pilots and the maintenance management in Sriwijaya Air led to the discovery of larger problems regarding the safety culture within the company.\n\nFinal report\nThe final report was published on 10 November 2022. It concluded that the crash had been caused by asymmetrical thrust setting due to a faulty autothrottle system. A feature central to the immediate deactivation of the autothrottle, the Cruise Thrust Split Monitor (CTSM), failed to work properly due to signal interference from the aircraft's spoilers, causing the thrust asymmetry to increase. The aircraft turned left instead of right as intended and eventually entered an upset condition. Lack of upset and recovery training contributed to the pilots' inability to prevent and recover from the upset condition.\n\nResponses\nIn the immediate aftermath of the accident, the state's insurance company Jasa Raharja announced that it would compensate the relatives of the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 182. Each next-of-kin of the deceased would receive Rp 50 million (US$3,530). Minister of Social Affairs Tri Rismaharini announced that her ministry would give Rp 15 million (US$1,060) for each victim for compensation.\n\nImmediate aftermath\nIn the immediate aftermath of the accident, the state's insurance company Jasa Raharja announced that it would compensate the relatives of the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 182.

(2) they must have been citizens of the United States for at least nine years; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election [7] The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives In Federalist No 62, James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing that the \"senatorial trust\" called for a \"greater extent of information and stability of character\":\n\n\nQualifications\nArticle I, Section 3, of the Constitution, sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for at least nine years; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election [7] The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives In Federalist No 62, James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing that the \"senatorial trust\" called for a \"greater extent of information and stability of character\":\n\n\nElections and term\nOriginally, senators were selected by the state legislatures, not by popular elections By the early years of the 20th century, the legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election of senators by referendums [22] Popular election to the Senate was standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment.\n\n\nElections\nElections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and occur simultaneously with elections for the House of Representatives [27] Senators are elected by their state as a whole The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution grants each state (and Congress, if it so desires to implement a uniform law) the power to legislate a method by which senators are elected Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates also vary from state to state.\n\n\nVacancies\nThe Seventeenth Amendment requires that vacancies in the Senate be filled by special election Whenever a senator must be appointed or elected, the secretary of the Senate mails one of three forms to the state's governor to inform them of the proper wording to certify the appointment of a new senator [29] If a special election for one seat happens to coincide with a general election for the state's other seat, each seat is contested separately A senator elected in a special election takes office as soon as possible after the election and serves until the original six-year term expires (i.e not for a full-term).\n\n\nTerm\nSenators serve terms of six years each; the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the seats are up for election every two years This was achieved by dividing the senators of the 1st Congress into thirds (called classes), where the terms of one-third expired after two years, the terms of another third expired after four, and the terms of the last third expired after six years This arrangement was also followed after the admission of new states into the union The staggering of terms has been arranged such that both seats from a given state are not contested in the same general election, except when a vacancy is being filled Class I comprises Senators whose six-year terms are set to expire on January 3, 2025 There is no constitutional limit to the number of terms a senator may serve.\n\n\nOath\n\nThe Constitution requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution [37] Congress has prescribed the following oath for all federal officials (except the President), including senators: \n\nSalary and benefits\nThe annual salary of each senator, since 2009, is $174,000; [39] the president pro tempore and party leaders receive $193,400 [39] [40] In 2003, at least 40 senators were millionaires; [41] by 2018, over 50 senators were millionaires (partly due to inflation) [42]\n\n\nSeniority\nBy tradition, seniority is a factor in the selection of physical offices and in party caucuses' assignment of committees When senators have been in office for the same length of time, a number of tiebreakers are used, including comparing their former government service and then their respective state population [43]\n\n\nTitles\nLike members of the House of Representatives, Senators use the prefix \"The Honorable\" before their names [44] [45] Senators are usually identified in the media and other sources by party and state; for example, Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, may be identified as \"D–New York\" or (D-NY) And sometimes they are identified as to whether they are the junior or senior senator in their state (see above) Unless in the context of elections, they are rarely identified by which one of the three classes of senators they are in.\n\n\nExpulsion and other disciplinary actions\nThe Senate may expel a senator by a two-thirds vote Fifteen senators have been expelled in the Senate's history: William Blount, for treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the Confederate secession Although no senator has been expelled since 1862, many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion proceedings – for example, Bob Packwood in 1995 The Senate has also censured and condemned senators; censure requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion, such as Robert Torricelli in 2002.\n\n\nMajority and minority parties\nThe \"majority party\" is the political party that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if two or more parties are tied, the vice president's affiliation determines which party is the majority party The next-largest party is known as the minority party The president pro tempore, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \"ranking members\" of committees) in the minority party Independents and members of third parties (so long as they do not caucus support either of the larger parties) are not considered in determining which is the majority party.\n\n\nSeating\nOne hundred desks are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle The Democratic Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the Republican Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats [46]\n\n\nOfficers\nExcept for the president of the Senate (who is the vice president), the Senate elects its own officers, [6] who maintain order and decorum, manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate, and interpret the Senate's rules, practices and precedents Many non-member officers are also hired to run various day-to-day functions of the Senate.\n\n\nPresiding officer\nUnder the Constitution, the vice president serves as president of the Senate They may vote in the Senate (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) in the case of a tie, but are not required to [49] For much of the nation's history the task of presiding over Senate sessions was one of the vice president's principal duties (the other being to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for president and vice president and to open the certificates \"in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives\", so that the total votes could be counted) Since the 1950s, vice presidents have presided over few Senate debates Instead, they have usually presided only on ceremonial occasions, such as swearing in new senators, joint sessions, or at times to announce the result of significant legislation or nomination, or when a tie vote on an important issue is anticipated.\n\n\nParty leaders\nEach party elects Senate party leaders Floor leaders act as the party chief spokesmen The Senate majority leader is responsible for controlling the agenda of the chamber by scheduling debates and votes Each party elects an assistant leader (whip), who works to ensure that his party's senators vote as the party leadership desires.\n\n\nNon-member officers\nIn addition to the vice president, the Senate has several officers who are not members The Senate's chief administrative officer is the secretary of the Senate, who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks The assistant secretary of the Senate aids the secretary's work Another official is the sergeant at arms who, as the Senate's chief law enforcement officer, maintains order and security on the Senate premises The Capitol Police handle routine police work, with the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight Other employees include the chaplain, who is elected by the Senate, and pages, who are appointed.\n\n\nProcedure\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television, usually by C-SPAN 2.\n\n\nDaily sessions\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television, usually by C-SPAN 2.\n\n\nDebate\nDebate, like most other matters governing the internal functioning of the Senate, is governed by internal rules adopted by the Senate During a debate, senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer, but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first senator who rises to speak Thus, the presiding officer has little control over the course of the debate Customarily, the majority leader and minority leader are accorded priority during debates even if another senator rises first All speeches must be addressed to the presiding officer, who is addressed as \"Mr President\" or \"Madam President\", and not to another member; other Members must be referred to in the third person In most cases, senators do not refer to each other by name, but by state or position, using forms such as \"the senior senator from Virginia\", \"the gentleman from California\", or \"my distinguished friend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee\" Senators address the Senate standing next to their desks [53]\n\n\nFilibuster and cloture\nThe filibuster is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely A filibuster may entail long speeches, dilatory motions, and an extensive series of proposed amendments The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking cloture In most cases, cloture requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the matter before the Senate involves changing the rules of the body – this includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster – a two-thirds majority is required In practice, the threat of filibuster is more important than its use; almost any motion that does not have the support of three-fifths of the Senate effectively fails This means that 41 senators can make a filibuster happen Historically, cloture has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required supermajority, so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster However, motions for cloture have increased significantly in recent years.\n\n\nVoting\nWhen the debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote The Senate often votes by voice vote The presiding officer puts the question, and members respond either \"Yea/Aye\" (in favor of the motion) or \"Nay\" (against the motion) The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote A senator, however, may challenge the presiding officer's assessment and request a recorded vote The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the senators present In practice, however, senators second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy When a recorded vote is held, the clerk calls the roll of the Senate in alphabetical order; senators respond when their name is called Senators who were not in the chamber when their name was called may still cast a vote so long as the voting remains open The vote is closed at the discretion of the presiding officer, but must remain open for a minimum of 15 minutes A majority of those voting determines whether the motion carries [59] If the vote is tied, the vice president, if present, is entitled to cast a tie-breaking vote If the vice president is not present, the motion fails [60]\n\n\nClosed session\nOn occasion, the Senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session During a closed session, the chamber doors are closed, cameras are turned off, and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or not essential to the session Closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the president, or deliberations during impeachment trials A senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member, but an agreement usually occurs beforehand [61] If the Senate does not approve the release of a secret transcript, the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security and ultimately sent to the national archives The proceedings remain sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of secrecy [62] In 1973, the House adopted a rule that all committee sessions should be open unless a majority on the committee voted for a closed session.\n\n\nCommittees\nThe Senate uses committees (and their subcommittees) for a variety of purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch Formally, the whole Senate appoints committee members In practice, however, the choice of members is made by the political parties Generally, each party honors the preferences of individual senators, giving priority based on seniority Each party is allocated seats on committees in proportion to its overall strength.\n\n\nSenate office buildings\nThere are presently three Senate office buildings located along Constitution Avenue, north of the Capitol They are the Russell Senate Office Building, the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the Hart Senate Office Building.\n\n\nFunctions\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives\" [66] As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate appropriation bills, or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds [67] [68] [69] [70] Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House However, when the Senate originates an appropriations bill, the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute in practice The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in which money bills approved by Parliament have originated in the House of Commons per constitutional convention [71]\n\n\nLegislation\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives\" [66] As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate appropriation bills, or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds [67] [68] [69] [70] Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House However, when the Senate originates an appropriations bill, the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute in practice The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in which money bills approved by Parliament have originated in the House of Commons per constitutional convention [71]\n\n\nChecks and balances\nThe Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that form its ability to \"check and balance\" the powers of other elements of the federal government These include the requirement that the Senate may advise and must consent to some of the president's government appointments; also the Senate must consent to all treaties with foreign governments; it tries all impeachments, and it elects the vice president in the event no person gets a majority of the electoral votes.\n\n\nCriticism\nThe Senate has been characterized as uniquely counter-majoritarian institutions in relation to legislatures in other countries Political scientist Robert Dahl wrote of the Senate, \"the degree of unequal representation in the U.S Senate is by far the most extreme  [and a] profound violation of the democratic idea of political equality among citizens.\" [81] The countermajoritarianism is rooted in two features First, the Senate's apportionment scheme, which apportions seats based on states rather than population, resulting in a small-state advantage Second, the filibuster enables a minority of the chamber to block action in the chamber [81]\n\n\nCounter-arguments\n\nJames Madison emphasized that the Senate serves as a check against the potential tyranny of the majority, ensuring that the interests of smaller states are not drowned out by the more populous ones This was despite Madison being initially opposed to equal suffrage before coming around to support it [94] In Federalist No 62 Madison writes about this tradeoff:\n\nSee also\nThe following are published by the Senate Historical Office.\n\n\nNotes\nThe following are published by the Senate Historical Office.\n\n\nReferences\nThe following are published by the Senate Historical Office.\n\n\nBibliography\nThe following are published by the Senate Historical Office.\n\n\nOfficial Senate histories\nThe following are published by the Senate Historical Office.\n\n\nExternal links\n38°53′26″N 77°0′32″W﻿ / ﻿38.89056°N 77.00889°W﻿ / 38.89056;

It has the power to make laws, approve presidential appointments, and try impeachments.\n\n**History**\nThe drafters of the Constitution debated more about how to award representation in the Senate than about any other part of the Constitution. While bicameralism and the idea of a proportional \"people's house\" were widely popular, discussions about Senate representation proved contentious. In the end, some small states—unwilling to give up their equal power with larger states under the Articles of Confederation—threatened to secede in 1787, and won the day by a vote of 5–4 in what became known as the Connecticut Compromise. The Connecticut Compromise provided, among other things, that each state—regardless of population—would be represented by two senators.\n\n**Membership**\nArticle I, Section 3, of the Constitution sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for at least nine years; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election. The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives. In Federalist No 62, James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing that the \"senatorial trust\" called for a \"greater extent of information and stability of character\".\n\n**Elections and Term**\nOriginally, senators were selected by the state legislatures, not by popular elections. By the early years of the 20th century, the legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election of senators by referendums. Popular election to the Senate was standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment. Senators serve terms of six years each; the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the seats are up for election every two years.\n\n**Vacancies**\nThe Seventeenth Amendment requires that vacancies in the Senate be filled by special election. Whenever a senator must be appointed or elected, the secretary of the Senate mails one of three forms to the state's governor to inform them of the proper wording to certify the appointment of a new senator. If a special election for one seat happens to coincide with a general election for the state's other seat, each seat is contested separately.\n\n**Oath**\nThe Constitution requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. Congress has prescribed the following oath for all federal officials (except the President), including senators.\n\n**Salary and Benefits**\nThe annual salary of each senator, since 2009, is $174,000; the president pro tempore and party leaders receive $193,400. In 2003, at least 40 senators were millionaires; by 2018, over 50 senators were millionaires (partly due to inflation).\n\n**Seniority**\nBy tradition, seniority is a factor in the selection of physical offices and in party caucuses' assignment of committees. When senators have been in office for the same length of time, a number of tiebreakers are used, including comparing their former government service and then their respective state population.\n\n**Titles**\nLike members of the House of Representatives, Senators use the prefix \"The Honorable\" before their names. Senators are usually identified in the media and other sources by party and state; for example, Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, may be identified as \"D–New York\" or (D-NY). And sometimes they are identified as to whether they are the junior or senior senator in their state.\n\n**Expulsion and Other Disciplinary Actions**\nThe Senate may expel a senator by a two-thirds vote. Fifteen senators have been expelled in the Senate's history: William Blount, for treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the Confederate secession. Although no senator has been expelled since 1862, many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion proceedings – for example, Bob Packwood in 1995. The Senate has also censured and condemned senators; censure requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office.\n\n**Majority and Minority Parties**\nThe \"majority party\" is the political party that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if two or more parties are tied, the vice president's affiliation determines which party is the majority party. The next-largest party is known as the minority party. The president pro tempore, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \"ranking members\" of committees) in the minority party.\n\n**Seating**\nOne hundred desks are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle. The Democratic Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the Republican Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats.\n\n**Officers**\nExcept for the president of the Senate (who is the vice president), the Senate elects its own officers, who maintain order and decorum, manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate, and interpret the Senate's rules, practices and precedents.\n\n**Presiding Officer**\nUnder the Constitution, the vice president serves as president of the Senate. They may vote in the Senate (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) in the case of a tie, but are not required to. For much of the nation's history the task of presiding over Senate sessions was one of the vice president's principal duties.\n\n**Party Leaders**\nEach party elects Senate party leaders Floor leaders act as the party chief spokesmen. The Senate majority leader is responsible for controlling the agenda of the chamber by scheduling debates and votes. Each party elects an assistant leader (whip), who works to ensure that his party's senators vote as the party leadership desires.\n\n**Non-Member Officers**\nIn addition to the vice president, the Senate has several officers who are not members. The Senate's chief administrative officer is the secretary of the Senate, who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks.\n\n**Procedure**\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation. Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides. Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays.\n\n**Daily Sessions**\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation. Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides. Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays.\n\n**Debate**\nDebate, like most other matters governing the internal functioning of the Senate, is governed by internal rules adopted by the Senate. During a debate, senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer, but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first senator who rises to speak.\n\n**Filibuster and Cloture**\nThe filibuster is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely. A filibuster may entail long speeches, dilatory motions, and an extensive series of proposed amendments. The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking cloture. In most cases, cloture requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the matter before the Senate involves changing the rules of the body – this includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster – a two-thirds majority is required.\n\n**Voting**\nWhen the debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote. The Senate often votes by voice vote. The presiding officer puts the question, and members respond either \"Yea/Aye\" (in favor of the motion) or \"Nay\" (against the motion).\n\n**Closed Session**\nOn occasion, the Senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session. During a closed session, the chamber doors are closed, cameras are turned off, and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or not essential to the session.\n\n**Committees**\nThe Senate uses committees (and their subcommittees) for a variety of purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch. Formally, the whole Senate appoints committee members. In practice, however, the choice of members is made by the political parties.\n\n**Senate Office Buildings**\nThere are presently three Senate office buildings located along Constitution Avenue, north of the Capitol. They are the Russell Senate Office Building, the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the Hart Senate Office Building.\n\n**Functions**\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress. However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes.\n\n**Legislation**\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress. However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes.\n\n**Checks and Balances**\nThe Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that form its ability to \"check and balance\" the powers of other elements of the federal government. These include the requirement that the Senate may advise and must consent to some of the president's government appointments; also the Senate must consent to all treaties with foreign governments; it tries all impeachments, and it elects the vice president in the event no person gets a majority of the electoral votes.\n\n**Criticism**\nThe Senate has been characterized as uniquely counter-majoritarian institutions in relation to legislatures in other countries. Political scientist Robert Dahl wrote of the Senate, \"the degree of unequal representation in the U.S Senate is by far the most extreme and a profound violation of the democratic idea of political equality among citizens.\" The countermajoritarianism is rooted in two features: the Senate's apportionment scheme, which apportions seats based on states rather than population, resulting in a small-state advantage; and the filibuster enables a minority of the chamber to block action in the chamber.\n\n**Counter-Arguments**\nJames Madison emphasized that the Senate serves as a check against the potential tyranny of the majority, ensuring that the interests of smaller states are not drowned out by the more populous ones. This was despite Madison being initially opposed to equal suffrage before coming around to support it. In Federalist No 62 Madison writes about this tradeoff:\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nOfficial Senate histories\n\nExternal links\n\n38°53′26″N 77°0′32″W﻿ / ﻿38.89056°N 77.00889°W﻿ / 38.89056; -77.00889", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"United_States_Senate\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe drafters of the Constitution debated more about how to award representation in the Senate than about any other part of the Constitution [14] While bicameralism and the idea of a proportional \"people's house\" were widely popular, discussions about Senate representation proved contentious In the end, some small states—unwilling to give up their equal power with larger states under the Articles of Confederation—threatened to secede [15] in 1787, and won the day by a vote of 5–4 in what became known as the Connecticut Compromise The Connecticut Compromise provided, among other things, that each state—regardless of population—would be represented by two senators [16]\n\n\nMembership\nArticle I, Section 3, of the Constitution, sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old; (2) they must have been citizens of the United States for at least nine years; and (3) they must be inhabitants of the states they seek to represent at the time of their election [7] The age and citizenship qualifications for senators are more stringent than those for representatives In Federalist No 62, James Madison justified this arrangement by arguing that the \"senatorial trust\" called for a \"greater extent of information and stability of character\":\n\n\nQualifications\nArticle I, Section 3, of the Constitution, sets three qualifications for senators: (1) they must be at least 30 years old;

the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the seats are up for election every two years This was achieved by dividing the senators of the 1st Congress into thirds (called classes), where the terms of one-third expired after two years, the terms of another third expired after four, and the terms of the last third expired after six years This arrangement was also followed after the admission of new states into the union The staggering of terms has been arranged such that both seats from a given state are not contested in the same general election, except when a vacancy is being filled Class I comprises Senators whose six-year terms are set to expire on January 3, 2025 There is no constitutional limit to the number of terms a senator may serve.\n\n\nOath\n\nThe Constitution requires that senators take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution [37] Congress has prescribed the following oath for all federal officials (except the President), including senators: \n\nSalary and benefits\nThe annual salary of each senator, since 2009, is $174,000; [39] the president pro tempore and party leaders receive $193,400 [39] [40] In 2003, at least 40 senators were millionaires; [41] by 2018, over 50 senators were millionaires (partly due to inflation) [42]\n\n\nSeniority\nBy tradition, seniority is a factor in the selection of physical offices and in party caucuses' assignment of committees When senators have been in office for the same length of time, a number of tiebreakers are used, including comparing their former government service and then their respective state population [43]\n\n\nTitles\nLike members of the House of Representatives, Senators use the prefix \"The Honorable\" before their names [44] [45] Senators are usually identified in the media and other sources by party and state; for example, Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, may be identified as \"D–New York\" or (D-NY) And sometimes they are identified as to whether they are the junior or senior senator in their state (see above) Unless in the context of elections, they are rarely identified by which one of the three classes of senators they are in.\n\n\nExpulsion and other disciplinary actions\nThe Senate may expel a senator by a two-thirds vote Fifteen senators have been expelled in the Senate's history: William Blount, for treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 for supporting the Confederate secession Although no senator has been expelled since 1862, many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion proceedings – for example, Bob Packwood in 1995 The Senate has also censured and condemned senators; censure requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion, such as Robert Torricelli in 2002.\n\n\nMajority and minority parties\nThe \"majority party\" is the political party that either has a majority of seats or can form a coalition or caucus with a majority of seats; if two or more parties are tied, the vice president's affiliation determines which party is the majority party The next-largest party is known as the minority party The president pro tempore, committee chairs, and some other officials are generally from the majority party; they have counterparts (for instance, the \"ranking members\" of committees) in the minority party Independents and members of third parties (so long as they do not caucus support either of the larger parties) are not considered in determining which is the majority party.\n\n\nSeating\nOne hundred desks are arranged in the chamber in a semicircular pattern and are divided by a wide central aisle The Democratic Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's right, and the Republican Party traditionally sits to the presiding officer's left, regardless of which party has a majority of seats [46]\n\n\nOfficers\nExcept for the president of the Senate (who is the vice president), the Senate elects its own officers, [6] who maintain order and decorum, manage and schedule the legislative and executive business of the Senate, and interpret the Senate's rules, practices and precedents Many non-member officers are also hired to run various day-to-day functions of the Senate.\n\n\nPresiding officer\nUnder the Constitution, the vice president serves as president of the Senate They may vote in the Senate (ex officio, for they are not an elected member of the Senate) in the case of a tie, but are not required to [49] For much of the nation's history the task of presiding over Senate sessions was one of the vice president's principal duties (the other being to receive from the states the tally of electoral ballots cast for president and vice president and to open the certificates \"in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives\", so that the total votes could be counted) Since the 1950s, vice presidents have presided over few Senate debates Instead, they have usually presided only on ceremonial occasions, such as swearing in new senators, joint sessions, or at times to announce the result of significant legislation or nomination, or when a tie vote on an important issue is anticipated.\n\n\nParty leaders\nEach party elects Senate party leaders Floor leaders act as the party chief spokesmen The Senate majority leader is responsible for controlling the agenda of the chamber by scheduling debates and votes Each party elects an assistant leader (whip), who works to ensure that his party's senators vote as the party leadership desires.\n\n\nNon-member officers\nIn addition to the vice president, the Senate has several officers who are not members The Senate's chief administrative officer is the secretary of the Senate, who maintains public records, disburses salaries, monitors the acquisition of stationery and supplies, and oversees clerks The assistant secretary of the Senate aids the secretary's work Another official is the sergeant at arms who, as the Senate's chief law enforcement officer, maintains order and security on the Senate premises The Capitol Police handle routine police work, with the sergeant at arms primarily responsible for general oversight Other employees include the chaplain, who is elected by the Senate, and pages, who are appointed.\n\n\nProcedure\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television, usually by C-SPAN 2.\n\n\nDaily sessions\nThe Senate uses Standing Rules for operation Like the House of Representatives, the Senate meets in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C At one end of the chamber of the Senate is a dais from which the presiding officer presides The lower tier of the dais is used by clerks and other officials Sessions of the Senate are opened with a special prayer or invocation and typically convene on weekdays Sessions of the Senate are generally open to the public and are broadcast live on television, usually by C-SPAN 2.\n\n\nDebate\nDebate, like most other matters governing the internal functioning of the Senate, is governed by internal rules adopted by the Senate During a debate, senators may only speak if called upon by the presiding officer, but the presiding officer is required to recognize the first senator who rises to speak Thus, the presiding officer has little control over the course of the debate Customarily, the majority leader and minority leader are accorded priority during debates even if another senator rises first All speeches must be addressed to the presiding officer, who is addressed as \"Mr President\" or \"Madam President\", and not to another member; other Members must be referred to in the third person In most cases, senators do not refer to each other by name, but by state or position, using forms such as \"the senior senator from Virginia\", \"the gentleman from California\", or \"my distinguished friend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee\" Senators address the Senate standing next to their desks [53]\n\n\nFilibuster and cloture\nThe filibuster is a tactic used to defeat bills and motions by prolonging debate indefinitely A filibuster may entail long speeches, dilatory motions, and an extensive series of proposed amendments The Senate may end a filibuster by invoking cloture In most cases, cloture requires the support of three-fifths of the Senate; however, if the matter before the Senate involves changing the rules of the body – this includes amending provisions regarding the filibuster – a two-thirds majority is required In practice, the threat of filibuster is more important than its use; almost any motion that does not have the support of three-fifths of the Senate effectively fails This means that 41 senators can make a filibuster happen Historically, cloture has rarely been invoked because bipartisan support is usually necessary to obtain the required supermajority, so a bill that already has bipartisan support is rarely subject to threats of filibuster However, motions for cloture have increased significantly in recent years.\n\n\nVoting\nWhen the debate concludes, the motion in question is put to a vote The Senate often votes by voice vote The presiding officer puts the question, and members respond either \"Yea/Aye\" (in favor of the motion) or \"Nay\" (against the motion) The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote A senator, however, may challenge the presiding officer's assessment and request a recorded vote The request may be granted only if it is seconded by one-fifth of the senators present In practice, however, senators second requests for recorded votes as a matter of courtesy When a recorded vote is held, the clerk calls the roll of the Senate in alphabetical order; senators respond when their name is called Senators who were not in the chamber when their name was called may still cast a vote so long as the voting remains open The vote is closed at the discretion of the presiding officer, but must remain open for a minimum of 15 minutes A majority of those voting determines whether the motion carries [59] If the vote is tied, the vice president, if present, is entitled to cast a tie-breaking vote If the vice president is not present, the motion fails [60]\n\n\nClosed session\nOn occasion, the Senate may go into what is called a secret or closed session During a closed session, the chamber doors are closed, cameras are turned off, and the galleries are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the closed session, or not essential to the session Closed sessions are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the president, or deliberations during impeachment trials A senator may call for and force a closed session if the motion is seconded by at least one other member, but an agreement usually occurs beforehand [61] If the Senate does not approve the release of a secret transcript, the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security and ultimately sent to the national archives The proceedings remain sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of secrecy [62] In 1973, the House adopted a rule that all committee sessions should be open unless a majority on the committee voted for a closed session.\n\n\nCommittees\nThe Senate uses committees (and their subcommittees) for a variety of purposes, including the review of bills and the oversight of the executive branch Formally, the whole Senate appoints committee members In practice, however, the choice of members is made by the political parties Generally, each party honors the preferences of individual senators, giving priority based on seniority Each party is allocated seats on committees in proportion to its overall strength.\n\n\nSenate office buildings\nThere are presently three Senate office buildings located along Constitution Avenue, north of the Capitol They are the Russell Senate Office Building, the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the Hart Senate Office Building.\n\n\nFunctions\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives\" [66] As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate appropriation bills, or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds [67] [68] [69] [70] Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House However, when the Senate originates an appropriations bill, the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute in practice The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in which money bills approved by Parliament have originated in the House of Commons per constitutional convention [71]\n\n\nLegislation\nBills may be introduced in either chamber of Congress However, the Constitution's Origination Clause provides that \"All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives\" [66] As a result, the Senate does not have the power to initiate bills imposing taxes Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does not have the power to originate appropriation bills, or bills authorizing the expenditure of federal funds [67] [68] [69] [70] Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation advocated by the House However, when the Senate originates an appropriations bill, the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute in practice The constitutional provision barring the Senate from introducing revenue bills is based on the practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, in which money bills approved by Parliament have originated in the House of Commons per constitutional convention [71]\n\n\nChecks and balances\nThe Constitution provides several unique functions for the Senate that form its ability to \"check and balance\" the powers of other elements of the federal government These include the requirement that the Senate may advise and must consent to some of the president's government appointments;

that Carpenter's direction and camera work made Halloween a \"resounding success.\" [26] Roger Ebert remarks, \"It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well Carpenter is uncannily skilled, for example, at the use of foregrounds in his compositions, and everyone who likes thrillers knows that foregrounds are crucial  .. \" [27] The opening title, featuring a jack-o'-lantern placed against a black backdrop, sets the mood for the entire film The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out Film historian J.P Telotte says that this scene \"clearly announces that  [the film's] primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception.\" [28] Carpenter's first-person point-of-view compositions were employed with steadicam; Telotte argues, \"As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye .. we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action.\" [29] Along with the 1974 Canadian horror film Black Christmas, Halloween made use of seeing events through the killer's eyes [30]\n\n\nProduction\nAfter viewing Carpenter's film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) at the Milan Film Festival, independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct a film for them about a psychotic killer that stalked babysitters [33] [34] In an interview with Fangoria magazine, Yablans stated: \"I was thinking what would make sense in the horror genre, and what I wanted to do was make a picture that had the same impact as The Exorcist.\" [33] Carpenter agreed to direct the film contingent on his having full creative control, [35] and was paid $10,000 for his work, which included writing, directing, and scoring the film [36] He and his then-girlfriend Debra Hill began drafting the story of Halloween [37] [38] [14] There were claims as early as 1980 that the film at one point was supposed to be called The Babysitter

been the theme in a film My idea was to do an old haunted house film.\" [41]\n\n\nConcept\nAfter viewing Carpenter's film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) at the Milan Film Festival, independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct a film for them about a psychotic killer that stalked babysitters [33] [34] In an interview with Fangoria magazine, Yablans stated: \"I was thinking what would make sense in the horror genre, and what I wanted to do was make a picture that had the same impact as The Exorcist.\" [33] Carpenter agreed to direct the film contingent on his having full creative control, [35] and was paid $10,000 for his work, which included writing, directing, and scoring the film [36] He and his then-girlfriend Debra Hill began drafting the story of Halloween [37] [38] [14] There were claims as early as 1980 that the film at one point was supposed to be called The Babysitter Murders but Yablans has since debunked this stating that it was always intended to be called (and take place on) Halloween [39] [40] Carpenter said of the basic concept: \"Halloween night It has never been the theme in a film My idea was to do an old haunted house film.\" [41]\n\n\nScreenplay\nIt took approximately 10 days to write the screenplay [37] Yablans and Akkad ceded most of the creative control to writers Carpenter and Hill (whom Carpenter wanted as producer), but Yablans did offer several suggestions According to a Fangoria interview with Hill, \"Yablans wanted the script written like a radio show, with 'boos' every 10 minutes.\" [33] By Hill's recollection, the script took three weeks to write, [43] and much of the inspiration behind the plot came from Celtic traditions of Halloween such as the festival of Samhain Although Samhain is not mentioned in the plot of the first film, Hill asserts that:\n\n\nCasting\nThe cast of Halloween included veteran actor Donald Pleasence and then-unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis [47] The low budget limited the number of big names that Carpenter could attract, and most of the actors received very little compensation for their roles Pleasence was paid the highest amount at $20,000, Curtis received $8,000, and Nick Castle earned $25 a day [33] The role of Dr Loomis was originally intended for Peter Cushing, who had recently appeared as Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars (1977); Cushing's agent rejected Carpenter's offer due to the low salary [58] Christopher Lee was approached for the role; he too turned it down, although the actor later told Carpenter and Hill that declining the role was the biggest mistake he made during his career [59] [60] Yablans then suggested Pleasence, who agreed to star because his daughter Lucy, a guitarist, had enjoyed Assault on Precinct 13 for Carpenter's score [61]\n\n\nFilming\nAkkad agreed to put up $300,000 ($1.4 million in 2022) for the film's budget, which was considered low at the time (Carpenter's previous film, Assault on Precinct 13, had an estimated budget of $100,000) [75] [33] Akkad worried over the tight, four-week schedule, low budget, and Carpenter's limited experience as a filmmaker, but told Fangoria: \"Two things made me decide One, Carpenter told me the story verbally and in a suspenseful way, almost frame for frame Second, he told me he didn't want to take any fees, and that showed he had confidence in the project\" Carpenter received $10,000 for directing, writing, and composing the music, retaining rights to 10 percent of the film's profits [76]\n\n\nMusical score\nCarpenter did the score as he was told that the film \"wasn't scary\" after doing a test screening [93] Instead of utilizing a more traditional symphonic soundtrack, the film's score consists primarily of a piano melody played in a 10/8 or \"complex 5/4\" time signature, composed and performed by Carpenter [41] [94] It took him three days to compose and record the entire score for the film Following the film's critical and commercial success, the \"Halloween Theme\" became recognizable apart from the film [95] Carpenter said it was also done in an hour [96] Critic James Berardinelli calls the score \"relatively simple and unsophisticated\", but admits that \"Halloween's music is one of its strongest assets\" [97] Carpenter once stated in an interview, \"I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note.\" [98] In Halloween's end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the \"Bowling Green Philharmonic Orchestra\", but he also received assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San José State University [33] [99]\n\n\nRelease\nHalloween premiered on October 24, 1978, in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, at the AMC Empire theatre Regional distribution in the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas was acquired by Aquarius Releasing [5] It grossed $1,270,000 from 198 theatres across the U.S (including 72 in New York City and 98 in Southern

The film is a seminal work in the horror genre, widely regarded as one of the most influential and iconic horror films of all time. The film's success can be attributed to its masterful blend of suspense, tension, and gore, which has captivated audiences for decades. In this article, we will delve into the making of Halloween, its themes, aesthetic elements, production, and reception, as well as its legacy and impact on the horror genre.\n\n**Plot**\nThe film takes place on Halloween night, 1963, in the suburban Illinois town of Haddonfield. The story begins with six-year-old Michael Myers, who brutally stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a chef's knife. Fifteen years later, Michael escapes from a psychiatric hospital, where he has been incarcerated since the murder of his sister. Dr. Samuel Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, drives with nurse Marion Chambers to the hospital to escort Michael to a court hearing. As Loomis exits the car to unlock the main gate, Michael jumps on the roof and attacks Marion. She flees from the vehicle, allowing Michael to steal the car and drive away.\n\n**Cast**\nThe cast of Halloween includes veteran actor Donald Pleasence and then-unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis. The low budget limited the number of big names that Carpenter could attract, and most of the actors received very little compensation for their roles. Pleasence was paid the highest amount at $20,000, Curtis received $8,000, and Nick Castle earned $25 a day.\n\n**Filming**\nAkkad agreed to put up $300,000 for the film's budget, which was considered low at the time. Akkad worried over the tight, four-week schedule, low budget, and Carpenter's limited experience as a filmmaker.

Instead of utilizing a more traditional symphonic soundtrack, the film's score consists primarily of a piano melody played in a 10/8 or \"complex 5/4\" time signature, composed and performed by Carpenter.

its genre at large, links sexuality with danger, saying that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\" [11] and that all the killings are sexual in nature She reinforces this idea

for example, at the use of foregrounds in his compositions, and everyone who likes thrillers knows that foregrounds are crucial  .. \" [27] The opening title, featuring a jack-o'-lantern placed against a black backdrop, sets the mood for the entire film The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out Film historian J.P Telotte says that this scene \"clearly announces that  [the film's] primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception.\" [28] Carpenter's first-person point-of-view compositions were employed with steadicam; Telotte argues, \"As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye .. we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action.\" [29] Along with the 1974

Fangoria: \"Two things made me decide One, Carpenter told me the story verbally and in a suspenseful way, almost frame for frame Second, he told me he didn't want to take any fees, and that showed he had confidence in the project\" Carpenter received $10,000 for directing, writing, and composing the music, retaining rights to 10 percent of the film's profits [76]\n\n\nMusical score\nCarpenter did the score as he was told that the film \"wasn't scary\" after doing a test screening [93] Instead of utilizing a more traditional symphonic soundtrack, the film's score consists primarily of a piano melody played in a 10/8 or \"complex 5/4\" time signature, composed and performed by Carpenter [41] [94] It took him three days to compose and record the entire score for the film Following the film's critical and commercial success, the \"Halloween Theme\" became recognizable apart from the film [95] Carpenter said it was also done in an hour [96] Critic James Berardinelli calls the score \"relatively simple and unsophisticated\", but admits that \"Halloween's music is one of its strongest assets\" [97] Carpenter once stated in an interview, \"I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note.\" [98] In Halloween's end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the \"Bowling Green Philharmonic Orchestra\", but he also received assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San José State University [33] [99]\n\n\nRelease\nHalloween premiered on October 24, 1978, in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, at the AMC Empire theatre Regional distribution in the Philadelphia and New York City metropolitan areas was acquired by Aquarius Releasing [5] It grossed $1,270,000 from 198 theatres across the U.S (including 72 in New York City and 98 in Southern California) in its opening week [103] The film grossed $47 million in the United States [8] and an additional $23 million internationally, making the theatrical total $70 million, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time; the film sold approximately 20,153,846 tickets during its initial theatrical release, and remains the most successful release of any Halloween film and the third most successful film in the slasher genre behind Scream (1996) and Scream 2 (1997) [104] [7]\n\n\nTheatrical distribution\nHalloween premiered on October 24, 1978, in downtown Kansas City,

the television rights to Halloween were sold to NBC for approximately $3 million [107] After a debate among Carpenter, Hill and NBC's Standards and Practices over censoring of certain scenes, Halloween appeared on television for the first time on October 30, 1981;  [108] the broadcast coincided with the release of Halloween II To fill the two-hour time slot, Carpenter filmed twelve minutes of additional material during the production of Halloween II The newly filmed scenes include Dr Loomis at a hospital board review of Michael Myers and Dr Loomis talking to a then-6-year-old Michael at Smith's Grove, telling him, \"You've fooled them, haven't you, Michael? But not me.\" Another extra scene features Dr Loomis at Smith's Grove examining Michael's abandoned cell after his escape and seeing the word \"Sister\" scratched into the door [107] Finally, a scene was added in which Lynda comes over to Laurie's house to borrow a silk blouse before Laurie leaves to babysit, just as Annie telephones asking to borrow the same blouse The new scene had Laurie's hair hidden by a towel, since Curtis was by then wearing a much shorter hairstyle than she had worn in 1978 [109]\n\n\nHome media\nSince Halloween's premiere, it has been released in several home video formats Early VHS versions were released by Media Home Entertainment [112] This release subsequently became a collectors' item, with one copy from 1979 selling on eBay for $13,220 in 2013 [112] On August 3, 1995, Blockbuster Video issued a commemorative edition of the film on VHS [113]\n\n\nReception\nUpon its initial release, Halloween performed well with little advertising, relying mostly on word-of-mouth, but many critics seemed uninterested or dismissive of the film Pauline Kael wrote a scathing review in The New Yorker suggesting that \"Carpenter doesn't seem to have had any life outside the movies: one can trace almost every idea on the screen to directors such as Hitchcock and Brian De Palma and to the Val Lewton productions\" and musing that \"Maybe when a horror film is stripped of everything but dumb scariness—when it isn't ashamed to revive the stalest device of the genre (the escaped lunatic)—it satisfies part of the audience in a more basic, childish way than sophisticated horror pictures do.\" [127]\n\n\nCritical response\nUpon its initial release, Halloween performed well with little advertising, relying mostly on word-of-mouth, but many critics seemed uninterested or dismissive of the film Pauline Kael wrote a scathing review in The New Yorker suggesting that \"Carpenter doesn't seem to have had any life outside the movies: one can trace almost every idea on the screen to directors such as Hitchcock and Brian De Palma and to the Val Lewton productions\" and musing that \"Maybe when a horror film is stripped of everything but dumb scariness—when it isn't ashamed to revive the stalest device of the genre (the escaped lunatic)—it satisfies part of the audience in a more basic, childish way than sophisticated horror pictures do.\" [127]\n\n\nContemporaneous\nUpon its initial release, Halloween performed well with little advertising, relying mostly on word-of-mouth, but many critics seemed uninterested or dismissive of the film Pauline Kael wrote a scathing review in The New Yorker suggesting that \"Carpenter doesn't seem to have had any life outside the movies: one can trace almost every idea on the screen to directors such as Hitchcock and Brian De Palma and to the Val Lewton productions\" and musing that \"Maybe when a horror film is stripped of everything but dumb scariness—when it isn't ashamed to revive the stalest device of the genre (the escaped lunatic)—it satisfies part of the audience in a more basic, childish way than sophisticated horror pictures do.\" [127]\n\n\nRetrospective\nYears after its debut, Halloween is considered by many critics as one of the best films of 1978 [136] [137] [138] [139] On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which records both contemporaneous and more recent reviews, Halloween holds a 96% approval rating based on 85 critic reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10 The consensus reads: \"Scary, suspenseful, and viscerally thrilling, Halloween set the standard for modern horror films.\" [140] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [141]\n\n\nAccolades\nHalloween was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films in 1979, but lost to The Wicker Man (1973) [145] In 2001, Halloween ranked #68 on the American Film Institute TV program 100 Years .. 100 Thrills [146] The film was #14 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments (2004) [147] Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 3rd scariest film ever made [148] In 2006, Halloween was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" [149] In 2008, the film was selected by Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time [150] In 2010, Total Film selected the film as one of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time [151] In 2017, Complex magazine named Halloween the best slasher film of all time [152] The following year, Paste listed it the best slasher film of all time, [153] while Michael Myers was ranked the greatest slasher villain of all time by LA Weekly [154]\n\n\nLegacy\nHalloween is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s and helped develop the slasher genre Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, [155] and the use of a theme song for the killer Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s [156] [157] Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream gave nods towards [158]\n\n\nRelated works\nA mass market paperback novelization of the same name, written by Curtis Richards (a pseudonym that was used by author Richard Curtis), was published by Bantam Books in 1979 It was reissued in 1982 [161] it later went out of print The novelization adds aspects not featured in the film, such as the origins of the curse of Samhain and Michael Myers' life in Smith's Grove Sanatorium, which contradict its source material For example, the novel's version of Michael speaks during his time at the sanitarium;

He was the son of Elendil, the founder of the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor, and played a significant role in the wars against Sauron. Isildur's story is deeply intertwined with the legend of the One Ring, which he failed to destroy, leading to its survival and ultimate quest by his descendant, Aragorn.\n\n**Fictional History**\n\nIn Tolkien's legendarium, the island of Númenor, in the great sea to the West of Middle-earth, was created at the start of the Second Age as a reward to the men who had fought against the fallen Vala Morgoth, the primary antagonist of the First Age. Isildur's father, Elendil, was descended from Elros, founder of the Kingdom of Númenor. Since Elros was half-elven, from the marriage of Beren to the elf Lúthien, he and his descendants enjoyed much longer life than other men.\n\n**Númenor**\n\nThe island of Númenor was a powerful and prosperous kingdom, known for its wisdom, courage, and nobility. The Númenóreans were descended from the Edain, the allies of the Elves in the wars against Morgoth. They were led by the wise and powerful King Tar-Minastir, who ruled Númenor for over 700 years. However, the kingdom was eventually corrupted by the influence of Sauron, and the Númenóreans became increasingly obsessed with the idea of conquest and domination. This led to their downfall, as they rebelled against the Valar and attempted to conquer the Undying Lands.\n\n**In Middle-earth**\n\nThe refugees from Númenor fled east to the continent of Middle-earth. Isildur's father, Elendil, landed in the north and founded the realm of Arnor, while Isildur and his brother Anárion landed in the south, where they established the realm of Gondor and the cities of Osgiliath, Minas Ithil, and Minas Anor. Isildur lived in Minas Ithil on the east side of the River Anduin, and Anárion in Minas Anor on the west side; they ruled Gondor jointly from Osgiliath.\n\n**Death**\n\nAt the Gladden Fields in the middle course of the River Anduin, Isildur's party was ambushed by roaming Orcs from the Misty Mountains. It was 5 October in the second year of Isildur's reign, and the second year of the Third Age. Isildur was killed by the Orcs, and the One Ring was lost to him.\n\n**Development**\n\nIn the short work The Fall of Númenor, written before 1937, Tolkien wrote of two brothers named Elendil and Valandil, who escaped the destruction of Númenor and founded two kingdoms in Middle-earth, Elendil in the north and Valandil in the south. Valandil was thus a precursor to the later Isildur, although in this work he was not Elendil's son but his brother.\n\n**House of Elendil**\n\nPaul H. Kocher writes that whereas Isildur claimed the Ring as his own, Aragorn, on hearing Frodo's exclamation that since he is Isildur's direct descendant the Ring must be his, at once renounces all claim to it. Aragorn explains that he searched for it to help Gandalf as \"it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault\", an inherited wrong. Catholic scholars have noted that just as Jesus, in his role as king, is a descendant of King David, Aragorn is a descendant of Isildur.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nPaul H.

The situations can be trivial, like confessing to a lie about educational history, or more complex, like raising a child. Fielder commissions extravagant sets with every detail recreated, and hires actors to inhabit these sets and practice different dialogue trees with his clients dozens of times to try to prepare them for every variable. Information used to train the actors and build the sets is often collected without the subjects' knowledge, which is often played with a comedic effect.\n\nThe series explores the human impulse to control one's own future and the futility of trying to prepare for every possible outcome. Fielder's approach is often absurd and humorous, but also thought-provoking and insightful. Through the series, Fielder raises questions about the nature of reality, the limits of human understanding, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe premise for The Rehearsal developed from Fielder's series Nathan for You.

She was particularly drawn to the world of fashion, which would later become her passion and profession.

However, Gupta has remained tight-lipped about the details of their separation. In recent years, Gupta has been focused on her career and personal growth, and it seems that she is moving forward with her life.\n\nIn a surprise move, Gupta married actor Satyadeep Mishra on January 27, 2023.

She is known for her distinctive performances in various television and film roles, including her iconic portrayal of Karen McDonald in the British soap opera Coronation Street.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJones was raised in a Catholic family and has an older brother named Gary. Her priest suggested that she be christened Sarah Ann(e) instead of Suranne, her great-grandmother's name, as Suranne was not considered \"a proper name.\" However, Jones has stated that she prefers her original name and has used it throughout her career.\n\n**Career**\n\nJones began acting professionally at the age of 16, initially appearing on stage in various productions. Her first role was at the age of 8, in the play Wait Until Dark as Gloria. She has since appeared in numerous stage productions, including plays and musicals.\n\n**Coronation Street**\n\nIn 2000, Jones was cast as Karen Phillips, a new character in the British soap opera Coronation Street. Her role as Karen, who later became Karen McDonald after marrying Steve McDonald, earned her widespread recognition and critical acclaim. Jones's portrayal of the character was described as \"a bulldog in hoop earrings\" and a \"Victoria Beckham wannabe.\" The character's feuds with rival Tracy Barlow, played by Kate Ford, became a central plot point in the show and garnered high viewing ratings.\n\nDuring her time on Coronation Street, Jones also began modeling for men's magazines such as FHM and Loaded. However, she has stated that she eventually realized the importance of focusing on her acting career and became more selective in her projects.\n\n**2005–2010**\n\nAfter leaving Coronation Street in 2003, Jones appeared in various television and film roles. She played the lead role in the BBC drama Doctor Who's 2005 Christmas special, \"The Christmas Invasion,\" alongside David Tennant. Jones also appeared in the ITV drama The Red Riding Trilogy, which earned her a British Independent Film Award nomination.\n\n**2011–2016**\n\nIn 2011, Jones appeared in the Doctor Who episode \"The Doctor's Wife,\" playing the central character of Idris. The episode was written by Neil Gaiman and featured Jones in a central role as the soul of the TARDIS. Her performance in the episode earned her widespread critical acclaim, with many praising her unique portrayal of the character.\n\nLater in 2011, Jones starred in the ITV detective series Scott & Bailey, opposite Lesley Sharp. The series was based on an original idea by Jones and Sally Lindsay, her former Coronation Street co-star. Scott & Bailey became a critical and commercial success, running for five series between 2011 and 2016.\n\n**2017–present**\n\nIn 2017, Jones reprised her role as Gemma Foster in the BBC drama Doctor Foster, which premiered to positive reviews. She also served as an associate producer on the show's second series, which was filmed in autumn 2016.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Jones has been an advocate for various charitable causes, including the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. She has also been involved in various initiatives to promote women's rights and equality in the entertainment industry.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nJones lives in Muswell Hill, north London, with her husband, freelance scriptwriter and former magazine editor Laurence Akers. The couple met in 2013 at the wedding of Jones's long-term friend, actress Sally Lindsay, to musician Steve White. They were married in 2014.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue, Jones stated that she had changed her name to Sarah Anne Akers after marrying her husband.

{"title": "Jermaine_O'Neal", "content": "\nEarly life\nO'Neal was born in Columbia, South Carolina [1] He and his older brother, Clifford, were raised by their mother, Angela Ocean [2] Ocean worked hard to support her sons and left her children largely to their own devices O'Neal found his love for athletics at a young age Tall and quick, he enjoyed both American football and basketball, but basketball was his favorite sport Two of his basketball heroes are Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Russell; O'Neal often marveled at Olajuwon's approach to the game, while he loved watching Russell's video highlights of his duels with Wilt Chamberlain [3]\n\n\nHigh school career\nEach summer, O'Neal would play for an AAU team and impressed onlookers with his athleticism and his ability to handle the ball with both hands By the time he turned 14, the 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) O'Neal—now a confident guard who could drain three-pointers—entered Eau Claire High School of the Arts as a freshman in 1992 In his first meeting with basketball coach George Glymph, he made the bold promise to become the best player in the school's history [2] While O'Neal's first season was hardly noteworthy (he even played as quarterback for the Eau Claire team) [4] things changed when he grew five inches over the next year and a half, and he was inspired to develop into a defensive powerhouse like his idol, Bill Russell Glymph built his team's defense around O'Neal, and Eau Claire featured one of the most imposing frontcourts around With O'Neal averaging 18 points, 12 rebounds and 9 blocks a game, Eau Claire captured its third straight 3A state title in 1995 [3]\n\n\nProfessional career\nO'Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft [1] The rookie was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland; forming the frontcourt with him were Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and Cliff Robinson After missing the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee, O'Neal made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December At 18 years, one month and 22 days, he became the youngest player to play in an NBA game (a mark that was later eclipsed by Andrew Bynum) [5] O'Neal also became the youngest player at 18 years, three months and eleven days to score 20 points in a game on January 22, 1997, against the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (1996–2000)\nO'Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft [1] The rookie was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland; forming the frontcourt with him were Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and Cliff Robinson After missing the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee, O'Neal made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December At 18 years, one month and 22 days, he became the youngest player to play in an NBA game (a mark that was later eclipsed by Andrew Bynum) [5] O'Neal also became the youngest player at 18 years, three months and eleven days to score 20 points in a game on January 22, 1997, against the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\n\n1996–97 season\nPortland was mediocre in the first half of the campaign, but came to form as the playoffs approached and managed to finish third in the Pacific Division with a 49–33 win–loss record [6] While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs, [3] the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games [6] In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game [7] For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game [7] O'Neal doubted for a while if he had made the right decision to skip college—he watched with envy as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come [3]\n\n\n1997–98 season\nDespite his optimism, O'Neal found it difficult to break into the first team the following season Brian Grant was acquired from free agency and new coach Mike Dunleavy Sr planned to use Sabonis, Wallace and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran Gary Trent also further reduced the sophomore's chances Thus, O'Neal was not given meaningful minutes in the early part of the campaign, although he showed glimpses of his potential with occasional double double performances when he returned from an early-season injury [3] Portland eventually produced a similar win–loss record as the preceding season with 46 wins, finishing fourth in the division [8] In the playoffs, Dunleavy opted to go with a more youthful lineup: before the trade deadline, he had acquired point guard Damon Stoudamire, as well as forwards Carlos Rogers and Walt Williams The move was designed to bolster the team's chances in the playoffs against teams that were bigger and more physical [3] Nevertheless, for the second time in two years, the Trail Blazers were eliminated by the Lakers in four games in the first round [8] And just like the season before, O'Neal hardly featured for Portland, playing only three minutes in one game [7]\n\n\n1998–99 season\nThe 1998–99 season was initially disrupted for several months following an impasse in the collective bargaining negotiations In the end, the league scaled down to a 50-game schedule, and Portland capitalized on the shortened campaign Boasting one of the league's most balanced squads that also had strength in depth, [9] the Trail Blazers chalked up an impressive 35–15 record and topped the division [10] Dunleavy—who would later be named NBA Coach of the Year—led his club into the playoffs aiming to capture the franchise's first NBA title since 1977 [11] After sweeping the Phoenix Suns 3–0 in the first round, Portland defeated the Utah Jazz 4–2 to set up a showdown with the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals [10] In game 2, a 3-pointer by Sean Elliott in the closing seconds gave the Spurs an 86–85 win [12] and propelled San Antonio to win the series (the Spurs went on to win the NBA championship) O'Neal's disappointment at losing in the Conference Finals was compounded by the fact that his regular-season minutes had dropped to fewer than 10 a game for the first time, [7] and that his contributions to the team were mostly insignificant, to begin with He was having increasing doubts about his NBA career [citation needed]\n\n\n1999–00 season\nHowever, in an unexpected move, Portland showed their willingness to invest in O'Neal by offering him a four-year contract worth $24 million [13] However, the new deal did not translate into more playing time for the power forward in the 1999–2000 season Portland acquired Detlef Schrempf, Scottie Pippen, and Steve Smith during the 1999 offseason, which meant that O'Neal was once again consigned to the bench His statistics remained unimpressive, averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the regular season [7] In the meantime, the Trail Blazers continued to build on the success of their previous campaign They notched 59 wins in the regular season, and defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Utah Jazz en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals [14] Up against recent perennial rivals the Los Angeles Lakers, the team relinquished a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter of the pivotal game 7, and lost 89–84 [15] O'Neal was not heavily involved in any of this action, however With back-to-back Conference Finals disappointments coupled with a lack of playing time, he soon announced his intention to be traded [13] The Trail Blazers relented in the end and sent him to the Indiana Pacers alongside Joe Kleine in exchange for NBA All-Star Dale Davis [16]\n\n\nIndiana Pacers (2000–2008)\nThe trade was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as the Pacers had just come off an appearance in the 2000 NBA Finals, and the trade involved losing a quality player for an unproven commodity in O'Neal [13] [16] The Pacers roster also saw the departures of Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Chris Mullin, and even coach Larry Bird stepped down All of this meant that O'Neal arrived in Indianapolis facing intense pressure and scrutiny [3]\nWhen O'Neal arrived at his new club, new coach Isiah Thomas—who had pushed for the O'Neal/Davis trade—told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed [17] At that time, Indiana was rebuilding and still revolved around veteran All-Star Reggie Miller O'Neal turned out to be a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team [17] [18] Starting in 80 of the 81 regular-season games he played in for the 2000–01 season, his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game [7] The big man helped his team to a 41–41 record and the eighth playoff seed; [19] he also led the league in total blocks (228, a franchise record), [18] and led the Eastern Conference in double-doubles [1] O'Neal kept up his form into the playoffs as well, averaging almost 9.8 points and 12.5 boards a game in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers, [7] although the series was short-lived as the latter emerged victorious in four games [19]\n\n\n2000–01 season: First season with the Pacers\nThe trade was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as the Pacers had just come off an appearance in the 2000 NBA Finals, and the trade involved losing a quality player for an unproven commodity in O'Neal [13] [16] The Pacers roster also saw the departures of Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Chris Mullin, and even coach Larry Bird stepped down All of this meant that O'Neal arrived in Indianapolis facing intense pressure and scrutiny [3]\nWhen O'Neal arrived at his new club, new coach Isiah Thomas—who had pushed for the O'Neal/Davis trade—told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed [17] At that time, Indiana was rebuilding and still revolved around veteran All-Star Reggie Miller O'Neal turned out to be a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team [17] [18] Starting in 80 of the 81 regular-season games he played in for the 2000–01 season, his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game [7] The big man helped his team to a 41–41 record and the eighth playoff seed; [19] he also led the league in total blocks (228, a franchise record), [18] and led the Eastern Conference in double-doubles [1] O'Neal kept up his form into the playoffs as well, averaging almost 9.8 points and 12.5 boards a game in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers, [7] although the series was short-lived as the latter emerged victorious in four games [19]\n\n\n2001–02 season: First All-Star and Most Improved Player\nI'm OK with my ability right now, but I can get a whole lot better I want to get to the point where I can destroy the entire league.\n\n\n2002–03 season: Franchise player\nThe Pacers started the 2002–03 season well, winning 14 of their first 16 games, [21] and had the best record in the East by the time the All-Star break arrived [18] The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most versatile players Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, [22] who could only finish the season 48–34 [21] On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10 [3] He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end [1] With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, [21] marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide [23] When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent [citation needed] The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers [24] Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings [22] Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again [according to whom?]\n\n\n2003–04 season: Best record in the NBA and franchise record\nDespite all the changes, O'Neal spearheaded the Pacers to a league-best 61–21 record in the 2003–04 season [25] He remained a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season [7] He also continued to rack up individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team [18] He finished third in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting Artest was instrumental to the team's success too as he enjoyed a breakthrough season, netting his first All-Star berth as well as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award [18] In the playoffs, Indiana gained revenge from the preceding season by sweeping Boston in the first round, before defeating the Miami Heat in the next [25] That sent them back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in 11 years, where they were disposed of by eventual NBA champions Detroit Pistons [18] In the series-deciding sixth game, O'Neal endured a sprained knee and managed to tally 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Richard Hamilton's inspired play ensured a close victory for the Pistons [26]\n\n\n2004–05 season: Suspension and career high in scoring\nThe Pacers looked to build on their previous campaign in the 2004–05 season, but all their plans came apart on November 19 In a game against the Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, a brawl named \"The Malice at the Palace\" broke out that spilled into the stands, after a fan threw a drink on Indiana Pacer Ron Artest O'Neal was one of the Pacers who fought with two fans who came onto the court; he ran to defend teammate Ron Artest and punched one of the fans in the head so hard that teammate Scot Pollard and sportscaster Jim Gray feared that O'Neal would kill the fan As he and his Pacer teammates left the court, many enraged fans threw snacks, drinks, and even a folding chair at O'Neal In response to O'Neal's actions during the brawl, NBA Commissioner David Stern suspended him for 25 games; teammates Artest and Stephen Jackson were suspended for the rest of the season and 30 games, respectively [18] Following an appeal just before Christmas, O'Neal won a ten-game reduction in his sentence, [18] but this did not mitigate the damage that Indiana had already suffered Stripped of three of its core players, the team hobbled to a 44–38 record and the sixth seed [27] O'Neal appeared in only 44 games, his lowest total ever with Indiana Although his scoring average improved to 24.3 points per game, his rebounding dropped and he was no longer the same intimidating presence on defense Things worsened when he sprained his right shoulder in March and played sparingly for the remainder of the regular season, while hoping to recover in time for the playoffs [3] The Pacers drew the Celtics in the first round, and managed to salvage their season by winning the series 4–3 [27] O'Neal's offensive output dropped, and he shot poorly from the field When the Pacers met the Pistons in the semifinals, they were eliminated in six games [27]\n\n\nBattling injuries and missing playoffs (2005–08)\nO'Neal continued his battle against injuries during the 2005–06 season, and played in only 51 games Nevertheless, he averaged a team-high 20.1 points and 9.3 rebounds a game [1] and was voted by the fans as the starting forward for the Eastern Conference All-Star team (he was later replaced by Gilbert Arenas due to injury) [28] The Pacers entered the playoffs as the sixth seed They eventually lost to the New Jersey Nets in six games [29]\n\n\nToronto Raptors (2008–2009)\nI didn't make the playoffs the last two years, had two really tough years physically and mentally, it doesn't really matter The personal accomplishments don't matter I understand what I need to do for this team to be successful and sometimes they're not going to need me to score They need me to bring the defensive presence.\n\n\nMiami Heat (2009–2010)\nThe Heat went 7–5 in O'Neal's first 12 games with his new club—including a victory over the Raptors at the Air Canada Centre—as they looked to secure the fourth seed for the playoffs The Heat eventually concluded the regular season with a 43–39 record and was seeded fifth [38] In the first round of the playoffs, the Atlanta Hawks defeated the Heat in seven games [38]\n\n\nBoston Celtics (2010–2012)\nOn July 14, 2010, O'Neal signed a two-year deal with the Boston Celtics [39] [40] He had a difficult season with his new team, missing 58 regular-season games with left knee and left wrist injuries, playing only 24 games and started in 10 of them, averaging 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 18.0 minutes per game O'Neal came back in the starting line-up for the 2011 NBA playoffs Boston (third seed) faced the New York Knicks in the first round O'Neal had a good series, especially in game 1 with 12 points and 5 blocks Boston swept the Knicks, but lost to the eventual Eastern Conference champions, the Miami Heat, in the second round in five games.\n\n\nPhoenix Suns (2012–2013)\nOn August 15, 2012, O'Neal signed a one-year contract with the Phoenix Suns [42] O'Neal cited the Suns' training staff as a major factor in his decision to sign with the team [43] He has been considered the leader around the locker room to replace the likes of Steve Nash and Grant Hill [44] As a result, O'Neal became a new captain of the team along with Jared Dudley.\n\n\nGolden State Warriors (2013–2014)\nOn July 23, 2013, O'Neal signed with the Golden State Warriors [48] On December 13, 2013, O'Neal underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right wrist He returned to action on February 4, 2014.\n\n\nNational team career\nFollowing his breakout season in 2000–01, O'Neal earned a spot on Team USA for the 2001 Goodwill Games The Americans won all of their five games and the gold medal, and O'Neal led the team in blocks and shooting percentage, while finishing second in points and rebounds [3] The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player was selected to represent his nation again in the 2002 World Basketball Championship which was held in Indianapolis This time round, the Americans had a lackluster tournament, and could only finish sixth [51] O'Neal averaged 7.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over eight games [51] The next year, Team USA staged a comeback in the 2003 Tournament of the Americas Winning all ten of its games and the gold medal, the team qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics [52] O'Neal featured in every game in that tournament, averaging 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per contest [52] While he was earmarked as a core member of the team that would compete in the Olympics, a knee injury prevented him from participating in the games.\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nO'Neal is married to Mesha and has two children: a son, Jermaine Jr., and a daughter, Asjia Asjia is an AVCA All-American volleyball player

American professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1996 to 2014. He is a 6'9\" (2.06 m) power forward who played for several teams, including the Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, and Golden State Warriors.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJermaine Lamond O'Neal was born on October 13, 1978, in Columbia, South Carolina. He was raised by his mother, Angela Ocean, and his older brother, Clifford. O'Neal found his love for athletics at a young age and enjoyed both American football and basketball. However, basketball was his favorite sport, and he was inspired by players such as Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Russell.\n\n**High school career**\n\nO'Neal attended Eau Claire High School of the Arts in Columbia, South Carolina. He played for the school's basketball team and impressed coaches with his athleticism and ability to handle the ball with both hands. By the time he turned 14, O'Neal had grown to 6'4\" (1.93 m) and was a confident guard who could drain three-pointers. He made the bold promise to his coach, George Glymph, to become the best player in the school's history.\n\n**Professional career**\n\nO'Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. He was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland. O'Neal formed the frontcourt with Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, and Cliff Robinson. He missed the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee but made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December. At 18 years, one month, and 22 days, O'Neal became the youngest player to play in an NBA game.\n\n**Portland Trail Blazers (1996–2000)**\n\nO'Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. He was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could show him the ropes in Portland. O'Neal formed the frontcourt with Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace, and Cliff Robinson. He missed the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee but made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December. At 18 years, one month, and 22 days, O'Neal became the youngest player to play in an NBA game.\n\n**1996–97 season**\n\nPortland was mediocre in the first half of the campaign, but came to form as the playoffs approached and managed to finish third in the Pacific Division with a 49-33 win-loss record. While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games. In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game.\n\n**1997–98 season**\n\nDespite his optimism, O'Neal found it difficult to break into the first team the following season. Brian Grant was acquired from free agency, and new coach Mike Dunleavy Sr. planned to use Sabonis, Wallace, and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran Gary Trent further reduced O'Neal's chances. O'Neal was not given meaningful minutes in the early part of the campaign, although he showed glimpses of his potential with occasional double-double performances when he returned from an early-season injury.\n\n**1998–99 season**\n\nThe 1998-99 season was initially disrupted for several months following an impasse in the collective bargaining negotiations. The league scaled down to a 50-game schedule, and Portland capitalized on the shortened campaign. Boasting one of the league's most balanced squads, the Trail Blazers chalked up an impressive 35-15 record and topped the division. Dunleavy, who would later be named NBA Coach of the Year, led his club into the playoffs aiming to capture the franchise's first NBA title since 1977.\n\n**1999–00 season**\n\nHowever, in an unexpected move, Portland showed their willingness to invest in O'Neal by offering him a four-year contract worth $24 million. However, the new deal did not translate into more playing time for the power forward in the 1999-2000 season. Portland acquired Detlef Schrempf, Scottie Pippen, and Steve Smith during the 1999 offseason, which meant that O'Neal was once again consigned to the bench. His statistics remained unimpressive, averaging 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the regular season.\n\n**Indiana Pacers (2000–2008)**\n\nThe trade was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as the Pacers had just come off an appearance in the 2000 NBA Finals, and the trade involved losing a quality player for an unproven commodity in O'Neal. The Pacers roster also saw the departures of Mark Jackson, Rik Smits, and Chris Mullin, and even coach Larry Bird stepped down. All of this meant that O'Neal arrived in Indianapolis facing intense pressure and scrutiny.\n\n**2000–01 season**\n\nWhen O'Neal arrived at his new club, new coach Isiah Thomas told him that he simply needed to work harder on his game to succeed. At that time, Indiana was rebuilding and still revolved around veteran All-Star Reggie Miller. O'Neal turned out to be a revelation for his new club and it was not long before he established himself as a key player for his new team. Starting in 80 of the 81 regular-season games he played in for the 2000-01 season, his statistics improved significantly as he averaged 12.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game.\n\n**2001–02 season**\n\nThe Pacers started the 2002-03 season well, winning 14 of their first 16 games, and had the best record in the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most versatile players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48-34. On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10.\n\n**2002–03 season**\n\nThe Pacers started the 2002-03 season well, winning 14 of their first 16 games, and had the best record in the East by the time the All-Star break arrived.

He remained a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season. He also continued to rack up individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team. He finished third in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting.

The Heat eventually concluded the regular season with a 43-39 record and was seeded fifth. In the first round of the playoffs, the Atlanta Hawks defeated the Heat in seven games.\n\n**Boston Celtics (2010–2012)**\n\nOn July 14, 2010, O'Neal signed a two-year deal with the Boston Celtics. He had a difficult season with his new team, missing 58 regular-season games with left knee and left wrist injuries, playing only 24 games and started in 10 of them, averaging 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks in 18.0 minutes per game.\n\n**Phoenix Suns (2012–2013)**\n\nOn August 15, 2012, O'Neal signed a one-year contract with the Phoenix Suns.

but basketball was his favorite sport Two of his basketball heroes are Hakeem Olajuwon and Bill Russell; O'Neal often marveled at Olajuwon's approach to the game, while he loved watching Russell's

In his first meeting with basketball coach George Glymph, he made the bold promise to become the best player in the school's history [2] While O'Neal's first season was hardly noteworthy (he even played as quarterback for the Eau Claire team) [4] things changed when he grew five inches over the next year and a half, and he was inspired to develop into a defensive powerhouse like his idol, Bill Russell Glymph built his team's defense around O'Neal, and Eau Claire featured one of the most imposing frontcourts around With O'Neal averaging 18 points, 12 rebounds and 9 blocks a game, Eau Claire captured its third straight 3A state title in 1995 [3]\n\n\nProfessional career\nO'Neal was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft [1] The rookie was surrounded

appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game [7] For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game [7] O'Neal doubted for a while if he had made the right decision to skip college—he watched with envy as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come [3]\n\n\n1997–98 season\nDespite his optimism, O'Neal found it difficult to break into the first team the following season Brian Grant was acquired from free agency and new coach Mike Dunleavy Sr planned to use Sabonis, Wallace and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran Gary Trent also further reduced the sophomore's

an early-season injury [3] Portland eventually produced a similar win–loss record as the preceding season with 46 wins, finishing fourth in the division [8] In the playoffs, Dunleavy opted to go with a more youthful lineup: before the trade deadline, he had acquired point guard Damon Stoudamire, as well as forwards Carlos Rogers and Walt Williams The move was designed to bolster the team's chances in the playoffs against teams that were bigger and more physical [3] Nevertheless, for the second time in two years, the Trail Blazers were eliminated by the Lakers in four games in the first round [8] And just like the season before, O'Neal hardly featured for Portland, playing only three minutes in one game [7]\n\n\n1998–99 season\nThe 1998–99 season was initially disrupted for several months following an impasse in the collective bargaining negotiations In the end, the league scaled down to a 50-game schedule, and Portland capitalized on the shortened campaign Boasting one of the league's

up a showdown with the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals [10] In game 2, a 3-pointer by Sean Elliott in the closing seconds gave the Spurs an 86–85 win [12] and propelled San Antonio to win the series (the Spurs went on to win the NBA championship) O'Neal's disappointment at losing in the Conference Finals was compounded by the fact that his regular-season minutes had dropped to fewer than 10 a game for the first time, [7] and that his contributions to the team were mostly insignificant, to begin with He was having increasing doubts about his NBA career [citation

[14] Up against recent perennial rivals the Los Angeles Lakers, the team relinquished a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter of the pivotal game 7, and lost 89–84 [15] O'Neal was not heavily involved in any of this action, however With back-to-back Conference Finals disappointments coupled with a lack of playing time, he soon announced his intention to be traded [13] The Trail Blazers relented in the end and sent him to the Indiana Pacers alongside Joe Kleine in exchange for NBA All-Star Dale Davis [16]\n\n\nIndiana Pacers (2000–2008)\nThe trade was greeted with surprise by the Indiana fans as

April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end [1] With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, [21] marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide [23] When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent [citation needed] The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers [24] Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when Isiah Thomas was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings [22] Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again [according to whom?]\n\n\n2003–04 season: Best record in the NBA and franchise record\nDespite all the changes, O'Neal spearheaded the Pacers to a league-best 61–21 record in the 2003–04 season [25] He remained a constant double-double threat, averaging 20.1 points and 10.0 rebounds a game in the regular season [7] He also continued to rack up individual honors, making his third All-Star trip and being named to the All-NBA Second Team [18] He finished third in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting Artest was instrumental to the team's success too as he enjoyed a breakthrough season, netting his first All-Star berth as well as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award [18] In the playoffs, Indiana gained revenge from the preceding season by sweeping Boston in the first round, before defeating the Miami Heat in the next [25] That sent them back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in 11 years, where they were disposed of by eventual NBA champions Detroit Pistons [18] In the series-deciding sixth game, O'Neal endured a sprained knee and managed to tally 20 points and 10 rebounds, but Richard Hamilton's inspired play ensured a close victory for the Pistons [26]\n\n\n2004–05 season: Suspension and career high in scoring\nThe Pacers looked to build on their previous campaign in the 2004–05 season, but all their plans came apart on November 19 In a game against the Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, a brawl named \"The Malice at the Palace\" broke out that spilled into the stands, after a fan threw a drink on Indiana Pacer Ron Artest O'Neal was one of the Pacers who fought with two fans who came onto the court; he ran to defend teammate Ron Artest and punched one of the fans in the head so hard that teammate Scot Pollard and sportscaster Jim Gray feared that O'Neal would kill the fan As he and his Pacer teammates left the court, many enraged fans threw snacks, drinks, and even a folding chair at O'Neal In response to O'Neal's actions during the brawl, NBA Commissioner David Stern suspended him for 25 games; teammates Artest and Stephen Jackson were suspended for the rest of the season and 30 games, respectively [18] Following an appeal just before Christmas, O'Neal won a ten-game reduction in his sentence, [18] but this did not mitigate the damage that Indiana had already suffered Stripped of three of its core players, the team hobbled to a 44–38 record and the sixth seed [27] O'Neal appeared in only 44 games, his lowest total ever with Indiana Although his scoring average improved to 24.3 points per game, his rebounding dropped and he was no longer the same intimidating presence on defense Things worsened when he sprained his right shoulder in March and played sparingly for the remainder of the regular season, while hoping to recover in time for the playoffs [3] The Pacers drew the Celtics in the first round, and managed to salvage their season by winning the series 4–3 [27] O'Neal's offensive output dropped, and he shot poorly from the field When the Pacers met the Pistons in the semifinals, they were eliminated in six games [27]\n\n\nBattling injuries and missing playoffs (2005–08)\nO'Neal continued his battle against injuries during the 2005–06 season, and played in only 51 games Nevertheless, he averaged a team-high 20.1 points and 9.3 rebounds a game [1] and was voted by the fans as the starting forward for the Eastern Conference All-Star team (he was later replaced by Gilbert Arenas due to injury) [28] The Pacers entered the playoffs as the sixth seed They eventually lost to the New Jersey Nets in six games [29]\n\n\nToronto Raptors (2008–2009)\nI didn't make the playoffs the last two years, had two really tough years physically and mentally, it doesn't really matter The personal accomplishments don't matter I understand what I need to do for this team to be successful and sometimes they're not going to need me to score They need me to bring the defensive presence.\n\n\nMiami Heat (2009–2010)\nThe Heat went 7–5 in O'Neal's first 12 games with his new club—including a victory over the Raptors at the Air Canada Centre—as they looked to secure the fourth seed for the playoffs The Heat eventually concluded the regular season with a 43–39 record and was seeded fifth [38] In the first round of the playoffs, the Atlanta Hawks defeated the Heat in seven games [38]\n\n\nBoston Celtics (2010–2012)\nOn July 14, 2010, O'Neal signed a two-year deal with the Boston Celtics [39] [40] He had a difficult season with his new team, missing 58 regular-season games with left knee and left wrist injuries, playing only 24 games and started in 10 of them, averaging 5.4 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in 18.0 minutes per game O'Neal came back in the starting line-up for the 2011 NBA playoffs Boston (third seed) faced the New York Knicks in the first round O'Neal had a good series, especially in game 1 with 12 points and 5 blocks Boston swept the Knicks, but lost to the eventual Eastern Conference champions, the Miami Heat, in the second round in five games.\n\n\nPhoenix Suns (2012–2013)\nOn August 15, 2012, O'Neal signed a one-year contract with the Phoenix Suns [42] O'Neal cited the Suns' training staff as a major factor in his decision to sign with the team [43] He has been considered the leader around the locker room to replace the likes of Steve Nash and Grant Hill [44] As a result, O'Neal became a new captain of the team along with Jared Dudley.\n\n\nGolden State Warriors (2013–2014)\nOn July 23, 2013, O'Neal signed with the Golden State Warriors [48] On December 13, 2013, O'Neal underwent surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right wrist He returned to action on February 4, 2014.\n\n\nNational team career\nFollowing his breakout season in 2000–01, O'Neal earned a spot on Team USA for the 2001 Goodwill Games The Americans won all of their five games and the gold medal, and O'Neal led the team in blocks and shooting percentage, while finishing second in points and rebounds [3] The 2002 NBA Most Improved Player was selected to represent his nation again in the 2002 World Basketball Championship which was held in Indianapolis This time round, the Americans had a lackluster tournament, and could only finish sixth [51] O'Neal averaged 7.3 points and 4.5 rebounds over eight games [51] The next year, Team USA staged a comeback in the 2003 Tournament of the Americas Winning all ten of its games and the gold medal, the team qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics [52] O'Neal featured in every game in that tournament, averaging 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per contest [52] While he was earmarked as a core member of the team that would compete in the Olympics, a knee injury prevented him from participating in the games.\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nO'Neal is married to Mesha and has two children: a son, Jermaine Jr., and a daughter, Asjia Asjia is an AVCA All-American volleyball player

Stern was Smith's attorney who was named executor of her will, which was drafted in 2001 by Eric James Lund, Esq.

Birkhead initiated the legal process by filing a lawsuit against Howard K Stern, who was listed as the father on Dannielynn's birth certificate. Birkhead asserted that he was the biological father and sought to prove his paternity through legal means. The court proceedings began in Broward County Circuit Court in Florida on February 21, 2007.\n\n**Disposition of Smith's Remains**\n\nThe disposition of Smith's remains became a significant aspect of the legal proceedings.
