She has stated that she was feeling burnt out and wanted to explore different sounds and styles. During this time, Rodrigo collaborated with various producers and songwriters, experimenting with new genres and techniques. The result was a more mature and introspective album that showcases Rodrigo's growth as an artist.\n\n**Writing and recording**\n\nRodrigo began writing songs for Guts in early 2022, with the intention of creating a more experimental and nuanced album. She worked closely with producers and songwriters such as Dan Nigro, Jack Antonoff, and Taylor Swift's collaborator, Justin Vernon. The writing process was characterized by a more relaxed and organic approach, with Rodrigo drawing inspiration from her personal experiences and observations. The recording sessions took place over several months, with Rodrigo often experimenting with different sounds and arrangements.\n\n**Music**\n\nGuts is a genre-bending album that incorporates elements of pop, rock, electronic, and R&B music. The album's sound is characterized by its use of atmospheric synths, distorted guitars, and introspective lyrics. Rodrigo has stated that she was inspired by artists such as Fleetwood Mac, The Cure, and Radiohead, and has cited these influences in her music.\n\n### **Lyrics**\n\nThe lyrics on Guts are deeply personal and introspective, with Rodrigo exploring themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. The album's lyrics are often abstract and poetic, with Rodrigo using metaphors and symbolism to convey her emotions.

The tour kicked off on June 1, 2023, in Los Angeles, and will visit cities across North America, Europe, and Australia. The tour features a mix of solo performances and full-band shows, with Rodrigo playing songs from Guts as well as her debut album, Sour.\n\n### **Tour**\n\nThe Guts Tour is a 30-date tour that will take Rodrigo across North America, Europe, and Australia.

Union of India\n\nThe Supriyo v. Union of India case is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India, delivered on July 17, 2021, that effectively decriminalized consensual homosexual relationships between adults in the country. The case revolves around the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which had been in place since 1861 and criminalized homosexual acts between consenting adults.\n\n## Case Summary\n\nThe case was filed by five petitioners, including Jayant Kishore, a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and three other individuals, who challenged the constitutional validity of Section 377. The petitioners argued that the law was violative of their fundamental rights, including the right to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to life and personal liberty.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Union of India, through the Ministry of Law and Justice, was the respondent in the case.

The campaign was a response to Russia's continued occupation of Ukrainian territory and its attempts to secure a permanent foothold in the country.\n\n**Background**\n\n### State of the war\n\nBy February 2023, the Russian military had been engaged in Ukraine for over a year, having launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Despite initial gains, the Russian military had become bogged down in a grinding war of attrition, suffering heavy casualties and equipment losses. The war had also taken a significant toll on the Ukrainian economy and civilian population.\n\n### Russian defenses\n\nRussia had established a complex network of defenses across Ukraine, including fortified positions, minefields, and sniper emplacements. The Russian military had also deployed a significant number of troops, including elite units such as the Spetsnaz, to counter Ukrainian offensives. However, the Russian defenses were not uniformly strong, with some areas, such as the Donbas region, being more heavily fortified than others.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Planning\n\nThe Ukrainian military had been planning a counteroffensive for several months prior to its launch, taking into account the lessons learned from previous battles and the shifting balance of forces on the battlefield. The operation was code-named \"Vladimir,\" after the Ukrainian city of Vladimir, which had been liberated from Russian forces in the early stages of the war. The Ukrainian military aimed to launch a series of coordinated attacks across multiple fronts, catching Russian forces off guard and exploiting their weaknesses.\n\n### Shaping operations\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, the Ukrainian military conducted a series of shaping operations, designed to weaken Russian defenses and create favorable conditions for the main attack.

The film was directed by Clyde Geronimi, Les Clark, and Eric Larson, and features the voice talents of Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, and Eleanor Audley.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Princess Aurora, a beautiful and kind-hearted princess who is placed under a sleeping curse by the evil fairy Maleficent. The curse is placed upon Aurora on her 16th birthday, and she falls into a deep sleep that can only be broken by the kiss of her true love. The film follows the story of Aurora's life, from her childhood to her eventual awakening, and the battle between good and evil that ensues.\n\nThe film's plot is divided into three acts. The first act introduces the main characters, including Aurora's parents, King Stefan and Queen Leah, and the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. The second act follows Aurora's life as a child, her 16th birthday, and the curse that is placed upon her. The third act follows Aurora's transformation into a sleeping princess, the battle between good and evil, and the eventual awakening of Aurora.\n\n# Voice cast\n\nThe voice cast for Sleeping Beauty includes:\n\n* Mary Costa as Princess Aurora\n* Bill Shirley as Prince Phillip\n* Eleanor Audley as Maleficent\n* Verna Felton as the voice of the Narrator\n* Barbara Luderowski as the voice of Flora\n* Barbara Jo Allen as the voice of Fauna\n* Rhoda Williams as the voice of Merryweather\n* Kay Blumer as the voice of Maleficent's Minions\n\n# Production\n\n## Story development\n\nThe idea for Sleeping Beauty was first conceived in the 1930s, but it wasn't until the 1950s that the film began to take shape. Walt Disney was inspired by the fairy tale \"La Belle au Bois Dormant\" by Charles Perrault, and he saw an opportunity to create a film that would be both a classic fairy tale and a unique Disney production.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for Sleeping Beauty was extensive, with numerous actresses auditioning for the role of Princess Aurora. Mary Costa was ultimately chosen for the role, and she went on to become a Disney legend. Bill Shirley was cast as Prince Phillip, and Eleanor Audley was cast as the evil fairy Maleficent.\n\n## Production delays\n\nThe production of Sleeping Beauty was delayed due to a number of factors, including the construction of Disneyland and the development of other Disney films. The film's budget was also a major concern, with estimates ranging from $3 million to $6 million.\n\n## Animation\n\n### Art direction\n\nThe art direction for Sleeping Beauty was handled by Claude Coats, who was responsible for creating the film's iconic backgrounds and settings. Coats' use of color and lighting helped to bring the film to life and create a sense of wonder and magic.\n\n### Live-action reference\n\nThe film's live-action reference was provided by Mary Costa, who performed in front of a camera to help the animators capture her movements and expressions.\n\n### Character animation\n\nThe character animation for Sleeping Beauty was handled by a team of talented animators, including Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Marc Davis. The animators used a combination of traditional animation techniques and new technology to bring the characters to life.\n\n## Music\n\nThe music for Sleeping Beauty was composed by George Bruns, who was assisted by the legendary Disney composer, George Bruns. The film's soundtrack features a number of iconic songs, including \"Once Upon a Dream\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\".\n\n# Release\n\n## Original theatrical run\n\nSleeping Beauty was released on January 29, 1959, at the Broadway Theatre in New York City. The film was a major success, and it went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1959.\n\n## Re-releases\n\nSleeping Beauty has been re-released numerous times over the years, including in 1970, 1978, and 1995. The film's 25th anniversary re-release in 1984 was a major event, and it helped to introduce the film to a new generation of audiences.\n\n## Home media\n\nSleeping Beauty was first released on home video in 1984, and it has since been released on numerous formats, including VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD.\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nIn 1999, a lawsuit was filed against Disney by the heirs of the film's original animator, Les Clark. The lawsuit claimed that Disney had failed to pay Clark's heirs a fair share of the film's profits.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nSleeping Beauty received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's animation, music, and storytelling. The film holds a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many considering it one of the greatest animated films of all time.\n\n## Accolades\n\nSleeping Beauty won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Score and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. The film was also nominated for several other awards, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\n# Legacy\n\nSleeping Beauty has had a lasting impact on popular culture, with its iconic characters and storylines continuing to inspire new generations of audiences.

The incident has become one of the most enduring and intriguing unexplained events in modern history, with a wide range of conspiracy theories and claims surrounding it.\n\n# 1947 Military Balloon Crash\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The next day, a press release was issued by the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) stating that they had recovered a \"flying disc.\" However, within 24 hours, the military retracted the statement and claimed that the object was actually a weather balloon that had been found.\n\n## Crash Site Investigation\n\nThe crash site was located on a ranch owned by W.W. Brazel, who claimed to have discovered a large amount of debris, including metallic materials, on his property. Brazel reported the incident to the local sheriff, who in turn notified the military authorities. A team of military personnel was dispatched to the crash site to investigate and collect the debris.\n\n## Initial Military Response\n\nThe military initially reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed that the object was a weather balloon that had been found. This contradictory statement has led to speculation about the true nature of the crash and the objects that were recovered.\n\n# UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947–1978)\n\n## Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax\n\nIn the early 1950s, a man named Silas M. Newton claimed that his business partner, Leo Gebauer, had discovered a crashed saucer in New Mexico and had sold the technology to the US government. Newton and Gebauer's story was later revealed to be a hoax, but it contributed to the growing legend of the Roswell incident.\n\n## Hangar 18\n\nHangar 18 is a supposedly secret US Air Force hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where many believe that the recovered extraterrestrial spacecraft from the Roswell incident are stored. The existence of Hangar 18 has never been officially confirmed, but it has become a central part of the Roswell legend.\n\n# Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978–1994)\n\n## The Roswell Incident\n\nIn 1978, a book called \"The Roswell Incident\" was published by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore, which claimed that the US government had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and had covered up the incident. The book helped to popularize the Roswell legend and sparked a new wave of conspiracy theories.\n\n## Majestic 12 Hoax\n\nIn the 1980s, a document called the Majestic 12 (MJ-12) memo surfaced, which claimed to be a top-secret memo from the US government about the Roswell incident. However, the memo was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n## Role of Glenn Dennis\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician at the Roswell Army Air Field during the time of the crash. He claimed to have played a role in the recovery of the bodies of the alleged extraterrestrial beings, but his story has been disputed by many experts.\n\n## Competing Accounts and Schism\n\nThere are several competing accounts of the Roswell incident, including the \"UFO Crash at Roswell,\" \"Crash at Corona,\" and \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell.\" These accounts often contradict each other, and some have been disputed by experts.\n\n### UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nThis account claims that the US government recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and that the crash site was a joint US-Soviet operation.\n\n### Crash at Corona\n\nThis account claims that the crash site was located at Corona, New Mexico, and that the recovered debris was of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n### The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n\nThis account claims that the US government recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and that the crash site was a joint US-Soviet operation, but that the incident was covered up due to the Soviet Union's involvement.\n\n# Air Force Response\n\nIn 1994, the US Air Force released a report stating that the Roswell incident was caused by a top-secret balloon project called Project Mogul. The report claimed that the debris recovered at the crash site was part of the balloon, and that there was no evidence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n# Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994–present)\n\n## Alien Autopsy\n\nIn 1995, a film called \"Alien Autopsy\" was released, which claimed to show footage of an extraterrestrial autopsy from the Roswell incident. However, the film was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n## The Day After Roswell\n\nIn 1997, a TV movie called \"The Day After Roswell\" was released, which claimed to be based on the true story of the Roswell incident. However, the movie was later revealed to be a work of fiction.\n\n## Related Debunked or Fringe Theories\n\nSeveral other theories and claims have been made about the Roswell incident, including the claim that the crash was caused by a German V-2 rocket, and that the recovered debris was of extraterrestrial origin. However, these claims have been disputed by experts and are considered to be fringe theories.\n\n# Explanations\n\n## Project Mogul\n\nProject Mogul was a top-secret balloon project that was launched by the US military in the 1940s. The project involved launching balloons to detect Soviet nuclear tests, and it is possible that one of these balloons crashed on a ranch in New Mexico, causing the Roswell incident.\n\n## Anthropomorphic Dummies\n\nAnother theory is that the debris recovered at the crash site was actually part of a top-secret military experiment involving anthropomorphic dummies. This theory has been disputed by experts, but it remains a popular explanation for the Roswell incident.\n\n## Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore\n\nThe Roswell incident has become a modern myth and folklore, with a wide range of conspiracy theories and claims surrounding it. The incident has been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows, and it continues to fascinate the public to this day.\n\n# Cultural Impact\n\n## Tourism and Commercialization\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant impact on the local economy, with many tourists visiting the area to learn more about the incident. The city of Roswell has capitalized on the incident, with a range of tourist attractions and shops selling Roswell-themed merchandise.\n\n## Popular Fiction\n\nThe Roswell incident has been the subject of numerous books, films, and TV shows, including the popular TV show \"Roswell\" which aired from 1999 to 2002. The incident has also been featured in several other TV shows and films, including \"The X-Files\" and \"Men in Black.\"\n\n## Statements by US Presidents\n\nSeveral US Presidents have made statements about the Roswell incident, including President Bill Clinton, who said that there was no evidence of extraterrestrial life, and President George W. Bush, who said that the government had not covered up any information about the incident.\n\n# See also\n\n* Unidentified flying object (UFO)\n* Alien abduction\n* Extraterrestrial life\n* Conspiracy theory\n* Project Mogul\n* Anthropomorphic dummies\n\n# References\n\n# Sources\n\n* Berlitz, C., & Moore, W.

Constructive set theory is based on intuitionistic logic, which is a formal system that rejects the law of excluded middle and the double negation law. This approach has led to the development of a number of subtheories of ZF set theory, including Bishop-style set theory and category theories.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nConstructive set theory is a response to the traditional set-theoretic foundations of mathematics, which are based on classical logic and the axiom of choice. In traditional set theory, the existence of a set is often established by showing that its existence does not lead to a contradiction, rather than by constructing the set explicitly. In contrast, constructive set theory requires that the existence of a set be established by constructing the set explicitly, rather than by showing that its non-existence leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Constructive Outlook**\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a formal system that is based on the idea that mathematical statements should be considered as problems to be solved, rather than as statements that are either true or false. In intuitionistic logic, the law of excluded middle is rejected, which means that a statement is not considered to be true simply because its negation is false. Instead, a statement is considered to be true only if it can be proved constructively, which means that it can be shown to be true by constructing an example or a counterexample.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes a number of restrictions on the traditional set-theoretic foundations of mathematics. These restrictions are based on the idea that mathematical objects should be considered as being constructed explicitly, rather than as being abstractly existing. Some of the key restrictions imposed by constructive set theory include:\n\n* The axiom of choice is rejected, because it allows for the selection of an element from a set without specifying which element is selected.\n* The law of excluded middle is rejected, because it allows for the consideration of a statement as being true without showing that it can be proved constructively.\n* The use of abstract sets is rejected, because they do not provide a clear and explicit construction of the mathematical objects that they denote.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical structure of a formal system, such as intuitionistic logic. In constructive set theory, metalogic plays an important role in establishing the consistency and soundness of the formal system. Metalogic is used to show that the formal system is free from contradictions and that the axioms of the formal system are consistent.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nAnti-classical principles are principles that reject the classical foundations of mathematics. In constructive set theory, anti-classical principles are used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence. Some of the key anti-classical principles used in constructive set theory include:\n\n* The principle of excluded middle is rejected, because it allows for the consideration of a statement as being true without showing that it can be proved constructively.\n* The double negation law is rejected, because it allows for the consideration of a statement as being true without showing that it can be proved constructively.\n\n**History and Overview**\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has a number of models, including the category of sets and the category of types. The category of sets is a classical model of set theory, but it does not satisfy the requirements of constructive set theory. The category of types is a constructive model of set theory, but it does not satisfy the requirements of classical set theory.\n\n**Notation**\n\n### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory is based on the language of intuitionistic logic, which includes:\n\n* Propositional variables: p, q, r, ...\n* Logical operators: ¬, ∧, ∨, →, ...\n* Quantifiers: ∀, ∃\n* Set variables: x, y, z, ...\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables are used to denote mathematical objects, including sets and functions. In constructive set theory, variables are used to denote the objects that are being constructed, rather than the abstract existence of the objects.\n\n### Classes\n\nClasses are used to denote sets of mathematical objects. In constructive set theory, classes are used to denote the sets that are being constructed, rather than the abstract existence of the sets.\n\n### Extensional equivalence\n\nExtensional equivalence is a relation between two mathematical objects that are considered to be equivalent if they have the same properties. In constructive set theory, extensional equivalence is used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence.\n\n**Subtheories of ZF**\n\n### Equality\n\nEquality is a fundamental concept in mathematics, and it is used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence. In constructive set theory, equality is based on the idea that two mathematical objects are equal if they can be shown to be equal by constructing an example or a counterexample.\n\n### Alternative approaches\n\nAlternative approaches to equality include:\n\n* The axiom of extensionality, which states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.\n* The axiom of replacement, which states that if a set has a property, then it can be replaced by a set that has the same property.\n\n### Merging sets\n\nMerging sets is a process of combining two or more sets into a single set. In constructive set theory, merging sets is used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence.\n\n### Set existence\n\nSet existence is a fundamental concept in mathematics, and it is used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence.

In BCST, the universal set is rejected, because it allows for the consideration of a set as being a member of itself, which leads to a contradiction.\n\n### Predicativity\n\nPredicativity is a concept in mathematics that is used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence. In BCST, predicativity is based on the idea that a set can be predicated as being a subset of another set if it can be shown that the subset is a proper subset.\n\n### Replacement\n\nReplacement is a fundamental concept in mathematics, and it is used to establish the existence of mathematical objects and to provide a constructive proof of their existence.

The protest, which gained international attention, highlighted issues of corruption, nepotism, and the need for accountability within the sport.\n\n**Background**\n\nWrestling is one of the most popular sports in India, and the country has produced several world-class wrestlers in recent years. However, the sport has also been plagued by allegations of corruption, favoritism, and abuse. In 2022, several Indian wrestlers, including Olympic medalists and world champions, came forward with allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by coaches, officials, and other influential individuals within the sport.\n\n**Initial Investigation**\n\nFollowing the allegations, the Indian government announced an investigation into the matter, led by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The investigation, which was overseen by the Sports Authority of India (SAI), aimed to identify those responsible for the alleged harassment and abuse and to ensure that justice was served. However, the investigation was criticized for being slow and ineffective, with many calling for a more comprehensive and independent probe.\n\n**Protest Overview**\n\nThe protest, which began in January 2023, was led by several prominent Indian wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, and Sakshi Malik. The protesters, who were primarily young wrestlers, demanded a thorough investigation into the allegations, accountability for those responsible, and an end to the culture of corruption and abuse within the sport. They also sought greater transparency and representation within the Indian wrestling community.\n\n**FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention**\n\nOn January 13, 2023, the wrestlers filed a First Information Report (FIR) with the Delhi Police, alleging corruption and abuse within the Indian wrestling community. The FIR, which was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sections 354, 354A, and 506, named several individuals, including coaches, officials, and influential wrestlers.\n\nIn response to the FIR, the Supreme Court of India issued a notice to the Indian government, seeking a response to the allegations. The court also directed the government to take immediate action to address the situation and to ensure that the rights of the wrestlers were protected.\n\n**Jantar Mantar Clash**\n\nOn January 16, 2023, the wrestlers clashed with police at Jantar Mantar, a prominent public space in New Delhi. The protesters, who were attempting to march to the Indian Parliament, were met with police barricades and tear gas. Several wrestlers were injured in the clash, including Olympic medalist Sakshi Malik, who was hospitalized for treatment.\n\n**Formation of SIT and Questioning of Witnesses**\n\nIn response to the clash, the Indian government announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the allegations. The SIT, which was led by a senior IPS officer, began questioning witnesses and gathering evidence.\n\nThe SIT also issued summons to several individuals, including coaches, officials, and influential wrestlers, to appear before them for questioning. However, many of those summoned failed to appear, citing various reasons, including illness and travel.\n\n**New Parliament House March and Detainment**\n\nOn January 18, 2023, the wrestlers attempted to march to the New Parliament House, but were again met with police barricades and tear gas. Several wrestlers were detained by the police, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia.\n\nThe detainees, who were taken to a police station, were released later that evening after being questioned by the SIT.\n\n**Meeting with Sports Minister and Filing of Chargesheet**\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the wrestlers met with the Indian Sports Minister, Anurag Thakur, to discuss their demands. The meeting, which was attended by several senior officials, including the SAI Secretary, aimed to resolve the impasse and to find a way forward.\n\nOn January 22, 2023, the SIT filed a chargesheet against several individuals, including coaches, officials, and influential wrestlers, for their alleged role in the corruption and abuse within the Indian wrestling community.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest led to significant changes within the Indian wrestling community. The Indian government, in response to the allegations and the protest, announced several measures to address the situation, including the formation of a new national wrestling federation, the establishment of a complaints committee, and the provision of support to victims of abuse.\n\nThe protest also led to a renewed focus on the need for accountability and transparency within the Indian wrestling community. Several prominent wrestlers, including Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, announced their decision to step down from their roles in the Indian wrestling community, citing the need for a fresh start.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n**Domestic**\n\nThe 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest was widely covered in the Indian media, with many newspapers and television channels carrying extensive coverage of the events. The protest was also widely discussed on social media, with many Indians expressing their support for the wrestlers and their demands.\n\nHowever, the protest was also criticized by some, who argued that the wrestlers were being too aggressive and confrontational in their approach. Others argued that the protest was being used as a platform for personal vendettas and score-settling.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nSome critics argued that the protest was being led by a small group of individuals who were more interested in gaining attention and fame than in addressing the genuine issues within the Indian wrestling community. Others argued that the protest was being used as a tool for political manipulation and that the Indian government was being unfairly targeted.\n\n**International**\n\nThe 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest also received international attention, with several major news outlets carrying stories on the events. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the United World Wrestling (UWW) issued statements expressing their support for the Indian government's efforts to address the situation.\n\n**United World Wrestling**\n\nThe UWW, the international governing body for wrestling, issued a statement expressing its support for the Indian government's efforts to address the allegations of corruption and abuse within the Indian wrestling community. The UWW also announced that it would be sending a delegation to India to investigate the allegations and to provide support to the Indian wrestling community.\n\n**International Olympic Committee**\n\nThe IOC, the international governing body for the Olympic Games, issued a statement expressing its concern about the allegations of corruption and abuse within the Indian wrestling community. The IOC also announced that it would be sending a delegation to India to investigate the allegations and to provide support to the Indian wrestling community.\n\n**Parliamentarians**\n\nSeveral parliamentarians, including those from the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament, expressed their support for the Indian wrestlers and their demands. Some parliamentarians also criticized the Indian government for its handling of the situation, arguing that it had been too slow and ineffective in addressing the allegations.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest was widely covered in the Indian media, with many newspapers and television channels carrying extensive coverage of the events. The protest was also widely discussed on social media, with many Indians expressing their support for the wrestlers and their demands.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest had a significant impact on the Indian wrestling community, leading to significant changes in the way that the sport is governed and practiced in India. The protest also highlighted the need for greater accountability and transparency within the Indian wrestling community, and led to a renewed focus on the rights and well-being of Indian wrestlers.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Image of Vinesh Phogat, one of the leaders of the 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest\n* Image of Bajrang Punia, another leader of the 2023 Indian wrestlers' protest\n* Image of Sakshi Malik, an Olympic medalist who was injured in the Jantar Mantar clash\n* Image of the Jantar Mantar clash between wrestlers and police\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Indian wrestling\n* Corruption in Indian sports\n* Women's rights in India\n* LGBTQ+ rights in India\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references as the information is based on publicly available data and the article is written in a neutral and informative tone.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Indian_wrestlers'_protest\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initial investigation\n#Protest overview\n##FIR registration and Supreme court intervention\n##Jantar Mantar clash\n##Formation of SIT and questioning of witnesses\n##New Parliament House march and detainment\n##Meeting with Sports Minister and filing chargesheet\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Criticism\n##International\n###United World Wrestling\n###International Olympic Committee\n###Parliamentarians\n#Media coverage\n#Impact\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Febrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 2-5% of children worldwide.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\n### Types\n\nFebrile seizures can be categorized into two main types: simple and complex.\n\n*   **Simple febrile seizure**: This type of seizure is characterized by a brief, generalized convulsion that lasts for less than 15 minutes, and is not associated with any other symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n*   **Complex febrile seizure**: This type of seizure is more severe, and is characterized by a prolonged convulsion that lasts for more than 15 minutes, or is associated with other symptoms such as fever, vomiting, or abdominal pain.\n\n### Causes\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the sudden increase in body temperature that occurs during a fever. This increase in temperature can cause an imbalance in the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, leading to the symptoms of a febrile seizure.\n\nOther factors that may contribute to the development of febrile seizures include:\n\n*   **Genetics**: Children who have a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience them.\n*   **Age**: Febrile seizures are most common in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.\n*   **Fever**: Febrile seizures are most likely to occur when a child's body temperature is elevated, typically above 38.3°C (100.9°F).\n\n### Mechanism\n\nThe mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the sudden increase in body temperature that occurs during a fever. This increase in temperature can cause an imbalance in the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, leading to the symptoms of a febrile seizure.\n\nThe process of a febrile seizure can be broken down into several stages:\n\n1.  **Increased body temperature**: An increase in body temperature, typically above 38.3°C (100.9°F), causes an imbalance in the levels of certain chemicals in the brain.\n2.  **Neurotransmitter imbalance**: The imbalance in neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and glutamate, can lead to the symptoms of a febrile seizure.\n3.  **Seizure onset**: The seizure onset is characterized by a brief, generalized convulsion that lasts for less than 15 minutes.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing febrile seizures can be challenging, as the symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, such as epilepsy or meningitis. However, a diagnosis of febrile seizure can be made based on the following criteria:\n\n*   **Fever**: A fever is a necessary component of febrile seizure.\n*   **Convulsion**: A convulsion is a necessary component of febrile seizure.\n*   **Age**: Febrile seizures are most common in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.\n*   **Family history**: Children who have a family history of febrile seizures are more likely to experience them.\n\n### Prevention\n\nWhile there is no surefire way to prevent febrile seizures, there are several strategies that may help reduce the risk:\n\n*   **Monitor body temperature**: Keeping a close eye on body temperature can help identify fevers early on.\n*   **Use antipyretics**: Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help reduce fever and alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Avoid overexertion**: Avoiding overexertion can help reduce the risk of febrile seizures.\n\n### Treatment\n\nTreatment for febrile seizures typically involves managing symptoms and preventing complications. The following strategies may be helpful:\n\n*   **Medications**: Medications, such as antipyretics or anticonvulsants, can help reduce fever and alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Cooling**: Cooling the body can help reduce fever and alleviate symptoms.\n*   **Rest**: Rest and relaxation can help alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.\n\n### Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for febrile seizures is generally good, with most children recovering fully from the condition. However, some children may experience recurrent febrile seizures, which can increase the risk of developing epilepsy.\n\n### Epidemiology\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting approximately 2-5% of children worldwide. The condition is more common in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, and is more likely to occur in children who have a family history of febrile seizures.\n\nIn conclusion, febrile seizures are a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, age, and fever. While the exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, managing symptoms and preventing complications can help alleviate the condition.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party was established in 1990 and has since become a prominent force in California politics.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Green Party of California was founded in 1990 by a group of activists who were dissatisfied with the two-party system and wanted to promote a more progressive and environmentally conscious agenda. The party's early successes were largely due to its strong grassroots organization and its ability to mobilize support for issues such as environmental protection, social justice, and electoral reform.\n\nOver the years, the GPCA has grown in influence and has become a major player in California politics. The party has had several notable successes, including the election of several mayors, city council members, and other local officials. The GPCA has also played a key role in shaping the state's electoral landscape, particularly with regards to the top-two primary system.\n\n**History**\n\n### Qualifying for Elections\n\nTo qualify for elections, the GPCA must meet certain requirements set by the California Secretary of State's office. These requirements include submitting a petition with a minimum number of signatures from registered voters, paying a filing fee, and submitting a candidate statement and other required forms. The party must also comply with the California Elections Code and other state laws governing elections.\n\nThe GPCA typically begins the process of qualifying candidates for elections several months in advance, using a combination of volunteer efforts and paid staff to gather signatures and prepare the necessary paperwork. The party's efforts are often focused on recruiting and supporting candidates who share the party's values and platform.\n\n### Electoral Milestones\n\nThe GPCA has achieved several notable electoral milestones over the years, including the election of several mayors, city council members, and other local officials. Some of the party's most significant electoral successes have included:\n\n* In 1994, the GPCA won its first city council seat in the city of Berkeley, with the election of Councilmember Laura Mamo.\n* In 2000, the party won its first mayoral seat in the city of Arcata, with the election of Mayor Larry Glass.\n* In 2004, the GPCA won several city council seats in the city of San Francisco, including the election of Supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and Tom Hsieh.\n\n### Top-Two Primaries\n\nThe GPCA has been a strong advocate for the top-two primary system in California, which was implemented in 2012. The system, also known as the \"jungle primary,\" allows voters to choose any candidate on the ballot, regardless of party affiliation, and the top two candidates advance to the general election.\n\nThe party has argued that the top-two primary system helps to promote more moderate and bipartisan politics, and has increased voter turnout. However, the system has also been criticized for leading to more expensive and divisive campaigns, and for making it more difficult for third-party candidates to compete.\n\n**Platform**\n\nThe GPCA's platform is based on a set of core principles and values that are reflected in the party's name and logo. The party's platform is focused on promoting environmental protection, social justice, and electoral reform, and includes a range of specific policies and proposals on issues such as:\n\n* Environmental protection: The GPCA supports policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy, and protect natural resources such as water and land.\n* Social justice: The party supports policies to promote economic justice, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ rights, and to address issues such as poverty, homelessness, and police brutality.\n* Electoral reform: The GPCA supports policies to reform the electoral system, including the adoption of ranked-choice voting, proportional representation, and other reforms to increase voter participation and reduce the influence of money in politics.\n\n**Organization**\n\n### Membership\n\nThe GPCA is a membership-based organization, with members from across the state who share the party's values and goals. Membership is open to anyone who supports the party's platform and is willing to participate in its activities. Members are encouraged to participate in local chapters, attend meetings and events, and engage in campaign activities.\n\nThe party's membership includes a range of individuals, including activists, volunteers, and elected officials. Members come from a variety of backgrounds and bring a range of skills and perspectives to the party's efforts.\n\n**Current Elected Officials**\n\nThe GPCA has several elected officials serving at the local and state levels, including mayors, city council members, and other local officials. Some of the party's current elected officials include:\n\n* Mayor of Arcata: Michael Winkler\n* Mayor of Fairfax: Kate Colin\n* Mayor of Fairfax: Tom Laughlin\n* City Council Member, Berkeley: Kate Harrison\n* City Council Member, San Francisco: Aaron Peskin\n* City Council Member, Oakland: Rebecca Kaplan\n\n### Mayoral Offices\n\nThe GPCA has had several mayors elected in cities across the state, including:\n\n* Larry Glass, Arcata (2000-2004)\n* Michael Winkler, Arcata (2016-2020)\n* Kate Colin, Fairfax (2020-present)\n* Tom Laughlin, Fairfax (2020-present)\n\n### Municipal Councils\n\nThe GPCA has had several city council members elected in cities across the state, including:\n\n* Laura Mamo, Berkeley (1994-1998)\n* Ross Mirkarimi, San Francisco (2005-2013)\n* Tom Hsieh, San Francisco (2005-2013)\n* Kate Harrison, Berkeley (2018-present)\n* Rebecca Kaplan, Oakland (2008-present)\n* Aaron Peskin, San Francisco (2018-present)\n\n**Election Results**\n\n### Presidential\n\nThe GPCA has not had any presidential candidates elected in California, although the party has had several candidates run for president in recent years.

This article provides an overview of the classification, structure, variations, history, distribution, and cultural significance of the arched harp.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe arched harp is a stringed instrument that belongs to the category of harps, which are characterized by their distinctive shape and mechanism of producing sound. Unlike the lyre, which has a flat soundboard and a horizontal frame, the arched harp features a curved or arched soundboard and a vertical pillar or column.

The referendums were widely condemned as illegitimate and coercive by the international community.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 annexation referendums were a culmination of a prolonged conflict between Ukraine and Russia that began in 2014. In February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, resulting in widespread destruction and human rights abuses. In response to the invasion, Ukraine declared martial law and called on its citizens to defend the country.\n\n**Organization**\n\nThe annexation referendums were organized by the Russian-appointed authorities in the occupied regions, with the support of Russian military forces. The referendums were conducted using a simple majority voting system, with voters required to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question of whether they wanted to join Russia. The voting process was widely criticized as being coercive, with reports of voters being intimidated, bribed, or forced to participate.\n\n**Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts**\n\n**Questions**\n\nThe referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts consisted of a single question: \"Do you support the decision of the people's deputies of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic to join the Russian Federation?\" The question was asked in both Russian and Ukrainian languages.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the referendums in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts were announced by the Russian-appointed authorities on September 23, 2022. According to the results, over 99% of voters in both oblasts supported joining Russia.

The turnout was reported to be over 67%, although the legitimacy of the voting process was widely disputed.\n\n**Zaporizhzhia Oblast**\n\n**Question**\n\nThe referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast consisted of a single question: \"Do you support the decision of the people's deputies of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Council to join the Russian Federation?\" The question was asked in both Russian and Ukrainian languages.\n\n**Result**\n\nThe result of the referendum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast was announced by the Russian-appointed authorities on September 27, 2022.

However, the referendum was not held, allegedly due to \"security concerns\".\n\n**Kharkiv Oblast**\n\nThe Russian-appointed authorities in Kharkiv Oblast announced plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia on September 25, 2022. However, the referendum was not held, allegedly due to \"security concerns\".\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the occupied regions in the run-up to the referendums suggested that a significant majority of voters supported joining Russia. However, the polls were widely criticized for their methodology and sample size.\n\n**Opinions on the goals of holding referendums**\n\nThe Russian government claimed that the referendums were held to determine the will of the people in the occupied regions, while the Ukrainian government and international community condemned the referendums as a form of coercion and an attempt to legitimize Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory.\n\n**Conduct**\n\nThe referendums were widely criticized for their lack of transparency and legitimacy. Voter turnout was reportedly low in many areas, and there were reports of voters being intimidated, bribed, or forced to participate.\n\n**First day**\n\nThe first day of the referendums, September 23, 2022, saw a significant turnout in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, with many voters reportedly casting their ballots in a matter of hours. However, there were reports of voting irregularities and intimidation of voters.\n\n**Second day**\n\nThe second day of the referendums, September 24, 2022, saw a decrease in turnout in some areas, with reports of voters being deterred by the lack of transparency and legitimacy of the voting process.\n\n**Third day**\n\nThe third day of the referendums, September 25, 2022, saw a significant increase in turnout in some areas, with reports of voters being coerced or intimidated into participating.\n\n**Fourth day**\n\nThe fourth day of the referendums, September 26, 2022, saw a decrease in turnout in some areas, with reports of voters becoming increasingly disillusioned with the voting process.\n\n**Fifth day**\n\nThe fifth day of the referendums, September 27, 2022, saw a significant increase in turnout in some areas, with reports of voters being coerced or intimidated into participating.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n**Ukraine**\n\nThe Ukrainian government and people condemned the referendums as illegitimate and coercive, with President Volodymyr Zelensky calling on the international community to recognize the referendums as a \"sham\".\n\n**Russia**\n\nThe Russian government and people supported the referendums, with President Vladimir Putin calling on the international community to recognize the results.\n\n**International organisations**\n\nThe United Nations, the European Union, and other international organizations condemned the referendums as illegitimate and coercive, with the UN Secretary-General calling on Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n**Countries**\n\nMany countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and other members of the European Union, condemned the referendums as illegitimate and coercive.\n\n**Human rights organizations**\n\nHuman Rights Watch and other human rights organizations condemned the referendums as a form of coercion and an attempt to legitimize Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory.\n\n**Other**\n\nThe referendums were widely condemned by the international community as a form of coercion and an attempt to legitimize Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territory.\n\n**Possible consequences**\n\nThe annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine may have significant consequences for the region, including:\n\n* Further escalation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia\n* Increased international sanctions on Russia\n* Recognition of the annexed regions as part of Russia by some countries\n* Increased tensions between Russia and the international community\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine have been widely condemned as illegitimate and coercive, with significant consequences for the region and the international community.

He is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his significant role in drafting and promoting the document. Madison served as President from 1809 to 1817 and is widely regarded as one of the most influential leaders in American history.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJames Madison was born in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway Madison. He was the oldest of 12 children and grew up on the family's plantation, Montpelier. Madison's father was a planter and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and his mother was a member of a prominent Virginia family. Madison's early education took place at the local school in Port Conway, where he demonstrated a keen interest in reading and learning.\n\nIn 1769, Madison enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied literature, philosophy, and law. During his time at Princeton, Madison became heavily influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly the works of John Locke and Adam Smith. He graduated from Princeton in 1771 and returned to Virginia to study law under Thomas Jefferson.\n\n**American Revolution and Articles of Confederation**\n\nIn 1774, Madison joined the Virginia House of Delegates, where he quickly became involved in the American Revolution. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1783, where he played a key role in the drafting of the Articles of Confederation. Madison was a strong advocate for a strong central government and was disappointed by the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nIn 1783, Madison helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War. He then returned to Virginia, where he served as a delegate to the Virginia State Convention, which drafted a new state constitution. Madison's experiences during the Revolution had a profound impact on his views on government and the Constitution.\n\n**Ratification of the Constitution**\n\nIn 1787, Madison attended the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he played a key role in the drafting of the United States Constitution. Madison was a strong advocate for a strong central government and was instrumental in the creation of the system of checks and balances. He worked closely with other Founding Fathers, including James Wilson and Alexander Hamilton, to ensure that the Constitution was ratified by the necessary number of states.\n\nMadison wrote several key papers, including \"Vices of the Political System of the United States\" and \"Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments,\" which helped to shape the Constitution and the early American republic. His advocacy for a strong central government and a bill of rights helped to shape the course of American history.\n\n**Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)**\n\n### Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served as a representative of Virginia. He was a strong advocate for a strong central government and worked closely with other members of Congress to pass key legislation, including the Tariff of 1789 and the Jay Treaty.\n\n### Bill of Rights\n\nIn 1791, Madison introduced the Bill of Rights, which consisted of 12 amendments to the Constitution. The amendments were designed to protect individual rights and liberties, such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to bear arms. Madison's advocacy for the Bill of Rights helped to shape the course of American history and cement his legacy as a champion of individual rights.\n\n### Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn 1792, Madison helped to found the Democratic-Republican Party, which was dedicated to the principles of limited government and individual rights. The party was opposed to the Federalist Party, which advocated for a strong central government and a more elitist approach to politics. Madison's leadership of the Democratic-Republican Party helped to shape the course of American politics and cement his legacy as a champion of the common man.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a widow with a young son. The couple had no children of their own, but Madison became a stepfather to Dolley's son, John Payne Todd. Madison's marriage to Dolley was a happy one, and she became a close advisor and confidante to her husband.\n\n### Adams presidency\n\nIn 1797, Madison served as Secretary of State under President John Adams, where he played a key role in shaping American foreign policy. Madison was a strong advocate for a policy of neutrality in European conflicts and worked closely with Adams to maintain good relations with European powers.\n\n**Secretary of State (1801–1809)**\n\n### 1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1804, Madison became President of the United States, succeeding Thomas Jefferson. He served two terms as President and is widely regarded as one of the most influential leaders in American history.\n\n**Presidency (1809–1817)**\n\n### Inauguration and cabinet\n\nOn March 4, 1809, Madison was inaugurated as President of the United States, succeeding Thomas Jefferson. He served two terms as President and is widely regarded as one of the most influential leaders in American history. Madison's cabinet included notable figures such as Robert Smith, James Monroe, and Albert Gallatin, who played key roles in shaping American policy.\n\n### War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to war\n\nIn 1810, Madison signed the Non-Importation Act, which prohibited American ships from trading with Great Britain. The act was intended to pressure the British to abandon their trade restrictions and impressment of American sailors. However, the British refused to comply, and tensions between the two countries continued to escalate.\n\n#### Military actions\n\nIn June 1812, Madison signed a declaration of war against Great Britain, which marked the beginning of the War of 1812. The war was fought on multiple fronts, including the invasion of Canada, the burning of Washington, D.C., and the Battle of Lake Erie. Madison's leadership during the war was widely criticized, and he was eventually forced to rely on the support of his cabinet and Congress to navigate the crisis.\n\n### Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nIn 1814, the Treaty of Ghent was signed, officially ending the War of 1812. The treaty marked a significant turning point in American history, as it marked the beginning of a period of renewed growth and expansion for the country. Madison's leadership during the war had been widely criticized, but he was able to maintain a high level of support from his party and the American people.\n\n### Native American policy\n\nDuring his presidency, Madison implemented a policy of forced relocation for Native American tribes, particularly the Creek Nation and the Seminole tribe. The policy was designed to open up land for white settlement and expansion, but it was widely opposed by Native American leaders and eventually led to the deaths of thousands of Native Americans.\n\n### Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison was re-elected as President, defeating DeWitt Clinton of New York. Madison's re-election was seen as a victory for the Democratic-Republican Party and marked the beginning of a new era of growth and expansion for the country.\n\n**Post-presidency (1817–1836)**\n\nIn 1817, Madison retired from politics and returned to Montpelier, where he spent the remainder of his life.

Born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria, Webern's life was marked by turmoil and upheaval, from the late Imperial era to the devastation of World War II. Despite facing significant challenges, Webern continued to compose and conduct music, leaving behind a legacy that would be rediscovered and reinterpreted in the decades following his death.\n\n**1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside**\n\nWebern's early life was marked by a unique blend of urban and rural influences. His family resided in Vienna, but spent summers in the countryside, where Webern developed a deep connection to nature and the traditional music of the region.\n\n### **Bucolic Heimat**\n\nThe Webers' country home in the village of Mödling, near Vienna, was a place of great significance for the young Anton.

He traveled extensively, working with a number of notable orchestras and conductors.\n\n**1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany**\n\nThe Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, marked a significant turning point in Webern's life.
