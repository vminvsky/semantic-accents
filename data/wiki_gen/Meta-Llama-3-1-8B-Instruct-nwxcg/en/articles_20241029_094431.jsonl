This phenomenon has occurred throughout history, from the early Christian era to the present day, and has been facilitated by various means, including missions, individual conversions, temple conversions, and colonialism.\n\nMissions\n--------\n\nChristianization has been driven by Christian missions, which have sought to spread the faith to diverse regions and cultures. These missions have taken various forms, from individual evangelists to institutionalized efforts sponsored by churches, governments, and other organizations.\n\nIndividual conversion\n-------------------\n\nIndividual conversion to Christianity has been a fundamental aspect of Christianization. This process typically involves several key rituals and practices, including:\n\n### Baptism\n\nBaptism is the ritual of initiation into the Christian faith, involving the application of water as a symbol of spiritual rebirth and purification. In many Christian traditions, baptism is seen as a prerequisite for full membership in the faith community.\n\n### Eucharist\n\nThe Eucharist, also known as Communion or the Lord's Supper, is a ritual in which believers consume bread and wine as a means of spiritual nourishment and communion with God. This practice is rooted in the Last Supper, which Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion.\n\n### Confirmation\n\nConfirmation is a sacrament or rite of passage in which individuals are reaffirmed in their faith, often accompanied by the laying on of hands and the bestowal of spiritual gifts. This practice is found in various Christian traditions, including Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some Protestant denominations.\n\nPlaces and practices\n-------------------\n\nChristianization has involved the conversion of various sacred sites, including temples, shrines, and other places of worship. This process has taken different forms, depending on the cultural and historical context.\n\n### Temple conversion within Roman Empire\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, Christian missionaries converted many pagan temples to Christian use, often incorporating existing structures and artifacts into their new worship practices.\n\n### Temple and icon destruction\n\nIn contrast, some Christian authorities have advocated for the destruction of pagan temples and icons, seen as threats to the faithful and obstacles to the spread of Christianity.\n\n### Other sacred sites\n\nChristianization has also involved the conversion of other sacred sites, including synagogues, mosques, and indigenous spiritual centers.\n\nNations\n--------\n\nChristianization has had a profound impact on the history and cultures of various nations, often shaping their institutions, values, and practices.\n\n### Roman Empire to Early Middle Ages (1 to 800)\n\nChristianization in the Roman Empire was a complex and multifaceted process, involving both voluntary and coercive means.\n\n#### Christianization without coercion\n\nIn some regions, Christianization occurred without significant coercion, as individuals and communities voluntarily adopted the faith.\n\n#### Constantine and the goal of Christianization\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity marked a turning point in the history of Christianization, as the faith gained imperial patronage and support.\n\n#### Albanians\n\nThe Albanians, a people living in the Balkans, were among the earliest Christian nations, with a long history of conversion to Christianity dating back to the 2nd century.\n\n#### Germanic conversions\n\nThe Germanic tribes, including the Goths, Vandals, and Lombards, were converted to Christianity through a process of gradual acculturation and assimilation.\n\n#### Frankish Empire\n\nThe Frankish Empire, established by Charlemagne, played a significant role in Christianizing the Germanic tribes and expanding the faith throughout Europe.\n\n#### Christianization with coercion under Justinian I\n\nThe Byzantine Emperor Justinian I implemented policies of Christianization through coercion, resulting in the forced conversion of many pagan communities.\n\n### Ireland\n\nIreland, with its rich Christian heritage, was an early center of Christianization, with missionaries like Saint Patrick spreading the faith to the Irish people.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nChristianization in Great Britain involved the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, who were initially resistant to the faith but eventually adopted it through a process of gradual assimilation.\n\n### Italy\n\nItaly, with its rich cultural and historical heritage, was an early center of Christianization, with missionaries like Saint Ambrose spreading the faith to the Italian people.\n\n### Greece\n\nGreece, with its ancient pagan traditions, was converted to Christianity through a process of gradual acculturation and assimilation.\n\n### Caucasian Albania\n\nCaucasian Albania, a region in the Caucasus, was an early center of Christianization, with missionaries like Saint Gregory the Illuminator spreading the faith to the Albanian people.\n\n### Armenia, Georgia, Ethiopia and Eritrea\n\nArmenia, Georgia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea were among the earliest Christian nations, with a long history of conversion to Christianity dating back to the 1st century.\n\n### A seismic moment on the Iberian Peninsula\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula, with its rich cultural and historical heritage, was an early center of Christianization, with missionaries like Saint James the Greater spreading the faith to the Spanish and Portuguese people.\n\n### Europe and Asia of the High and Late Middle Ages (800 to 1500)\n\nDuring this period, Christianization continued to expand throughout Europe and Asia, with the establishment of new kingdoms, empires, and trade routes.\n\n### Language and literature\n\nChristianization had a profound impact on language and literature, with the development of new languages, such as Latin and Greek, and the creation of a vast body of Christian literature.\n\n### Bulgaria\n\nBulgaria, with its rich cultural and historical heritage, was an early center of Christianization, with missionaries like Saint Boris spreading the faith to the Bulgarian people.\n\n### Serbia\n\nSerbia, with its ancient pagan traditions, was converted to Christianity through a process of gradual acculturation and assimilation.\n\n### Croatia\n\nCroatia, with

lands\n\nBohemia, with its ancient pagan traditions, was converted to Christianity through a process of gradual acculturation and assimilation.\n\n### Poland\n\nPoland, with its rich cultural and

The outbreak began in May 2022 and has spread to over 90 countries, affecting thousands of people worldwide.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nIn the years leading up to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health authorities had been monitoring the situation in Africa, where mpox was endemic. The WHO had also established protocols for responding to outbreaks, including the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMpox has been present in Africa for decades, with the first reported cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970. The virus is typically found in the tropical rainforests of central and western Africa, and is transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or contaminated materials.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022 outbreak was caused by a distinct variant of the mpox virus, known as clade IIb. This variant was first identified in the UK in May 2022 and was found to be distinct from the clade I and III variants that were previously known to cause human disease.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nThe incubation period for mpox is typically 6-13 days, although it can range from 5-21 days. This long incubation period made it challenging for public health officials to track the spread of the virus and identify potential cases.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nThe majority of people infected with mpox experience mild symptoms, including fever, headache, and muscle aches. In some cases, the virus can cause more severe symptoms, including rash, lesions, and respiratory problems.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nThere was concern that the mpox outbreak could be zoonotic, meaning that it could be transmitted between humans and animals. However, further investigation suggested that the outbreak was primarily driven by human-to-human transmission.\n\n**Chronology**\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nAs of March 2023, there have been over 30 reported deaths outside of Africa, primarily in Europe and North America.\n\n**Transmission**\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nThe mpox virus is primarily transmitted through close contact with an infected person, including skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and sharing of personal items. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces or materials.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been used to track the spread of the mpox virus in some countries. By analyzing wastewater samples for the presence of the virus, health officials can identify potential outbreaks and take steps to contain them.\n\n**Interventions**\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nPublic health officials have used a variety of interventions to contain the outbreak, including testing for the virus, contact tracing, and quarantine. Isolation protocols have also been established for people with confirmed cases of mpox.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nSeveral vaccines have been developed to protect against mpox, including the Jynneos vaccine, which has been approved for use in the US and EU. Vaccination campaigns have been launched in several countries, with the goal of protecting high-risk populations and preventing further transmission.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThere has been a significant amount of misinformation circulating about the mpox outbreak, including false claims about the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of vaccines. Public health officials have worked to address these misconceptions through social media campaigns and other outreach efforts.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe WHO has played a key role in responding to the mpox outbreak, providing guidance and support to countries affected by the outbreak. The WHO has also established a coordinating committee to oversee the international response to the outbreak.\n\n### Countries\n\nCountries have responded to the outbreak in a variety of ways, including establishing testing and contact tracing protocols, launching vaccination campaigns, and implementing travel restrictions. Some countries have also taken steps to mitigate the economic impact of the outbreak, including providing financial support to affected businesses.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nDependent territories have also been affected by the outbreak, including the US territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Health officials in these territories have worked to establish testing and contact tracing protocols, and to implement vaccination campaigns.\n\n**Cases per Country and Territory**\n\nHere is a list

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGauss was born on April 30, 1777, in the town of Braunschweig, Germany. His early life was marked by a strong interest in mathematics and science, which was encouraged by his family and teachers. He began his formal education at the age of 7, and soon showed exceptional talent and aptitude for mathematics. Gauss's academic career was marked by a series of achievements that would ultimately lead him to become one of the most respected mathematicians of his time.\n\n**Youth and Education**\n\nGauss's early education began at the Schulfporta, a school in Braunschweig, where he showed exceptional talent and aptitude for mathematics and science. He was particularly drawn to the works of Leonhard Euler and Pietro Cataldi, and his teachers encouraged his interest in mathematics. In 1792, Gauss entered the University of GÃ¶ttingen, where he studied mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy. During his time at university, Gauss was heavily influenced by the works of Johann Friedrich Lorenz and Johann Bernoulli.\n\n**Private Scholar**\n\nGauss's academic career was marked by a series of breakthroughs and discoveries that would ultimately lead him to become one of the most respected mathematicians of his time. In 1795, Gauss began to work on his first major project, a comprehensive treatment of the theory of numbers. This work, which would eventually become known as the \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,\" would take him several years to complete. In the meantime, Gauss continued to work on other projects, including a comprehensive treatment of the theory of conic sections and a new theory of optics.\n\n**Professor in GÃ¶ttingen**\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, where he would remain for the rest of his career. During his time at GÃ¶ttingen, Gauss continued to work on his major projects, including the \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" and a comprehensive treatment of the theory of errors. He also began to work on a new project, a comprehensive treatment of the theory of magnetism, which would eventually become known as the \"Erlangen Program.\"\n\n**Gauss's Brain**\n\nIn 1831, Gauss suffered a series of strokes that left him partially paralyzed. His brain was preserved and later examined by his son-in-law, and it was discovered that he had a number of unusual features, including a large and convoluted cerebral cortex. This has led to speculation that Gauss's brain was somehow linked to his exceptional mathematical abilities, although this remains a topic of debate among scientists.\n\n**Family**\n\nGauss was married to Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and they had three children together. However, Johanna died in 1809, and Gauss was left to care for their children on his own. In 1810, Gauss married Minna Waldeck, and they had five children together. Gauss was known to be a devoted family man, and his family played an important role in his life.\n\n**Personality**\n\nGauss was known to be a private and introverted person, who preferred to keep to himself. However, he was also known to be a fiercely loyal and dedicated friend, and he maintained close relationships with many of his colleagues and acquaintances. Gauss was also known to be a perfectionist, who demanded the highest standards from himself and others. This trait served him well in his academic career, but it also made him prone to anxiety and self-doubt.\n\n**Scholar**\n\nGauss was a prolific scholar, who made significant contributions to many fields, including number theory, algebra, analysis, geometry, astronomy, and physics. His work on the theory of numbers, in particular, was groundbreaking, and it laid the foundation for many subsequent developments in mathematics. Gauss's work on the theory of errors was also highly influential, and it has had a lasting impact on the development of statistics and probability theory.\n\n**Private Man**\n\nDespite his many accomplishments, Gauss was a private and humble man, who preferred to keep a low profile. He was known to be a devoted family man, and he was deeply committed to his community. Gauss was also a skilled musician, who played the piano and the violin with great skill.

It is managed by the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) and is considered one of the most competitive and popular sports leagues in the country.\n\n## History\n\n### Origins\n\nThe history of Liga 1 dates back to 1921, when the Dutch East Indies Football Association (NEVO) was established, which marked the beginning of organized football in Indonesia. However, the first official top-tier league was established in 1922, with the winner being the Indonesian club, Voetbalbond Indo-Europeesche Vereeniging.\n\n### Foundation\n\nThe modern version of Liga 1 was founded in 1994 as the first division of the Indonesian football league system. The league was initially known as the Liga Indonesia and was composed of 13 teams. The league was rebranded as the Super League in 2008 and later as Liga 1 in 2017.\n\n### Dualism\n\nLiga 1 has a long history of dualism, with two rival leagues, Liga 1 and the Indonesian Premier League (IPL), competing for dominance. The IPL was formed in 2010 as a rival to Liga 1, but it eventually merged with Liga 1 in 2017.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nLiga 1 has faced several challenges, including government intervention and a suspension by FIFA. In 2015, the PSSI was suspended by FIFA due to government interference, which led to the league being suspended. The suspension was lifted in 2016, and the league resumed in 2017.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the league was rebranded as Liga 1, a name that is derived from the Indonesian phrase \"liga satu,\" which means \"first league.\"\n\n## Competition format\n\n### Competition\n\nLiga 1 is a professional football league that features 18 teams competing in a double round-robin format. The teams play each other twice, once at home and once away, with the team earning the most points declared the champion.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in Liga 1 are relegated to the second division, Liga 2, while the top three teams in Liga 2 are promoted to Liga 1.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nLiga 1 introduced the use of video assistant referee (VAR) in 2019 to improve the accuracy of refereeing decisions.\n\n## Clubs\n\n### Champions\n\nThe following are the champions of Liga 1 since its inception:\n\n* 1994: Persekabpas Pasuruan\n* 1995: PSM Makassar\n* 1996: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1997: PSM Makassar\n* 1998: PSM Makassar\n* 1999: Arema Malang\n* 2000: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2001: PSIS Semarang\n* 2002: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2003: Arema Malang\n* 2004: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2005: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2006: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2007: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2008: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2009: Bontang FC\n* 2010: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2011: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2012: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2013: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2014: Arema FC\n* 2015: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2016: Persib Bandung\n* 2017: Bali United\n* 2018: Bali United\n* 2019: Bali United\n* 2020: Not held due to COVID-19 pandemic\n* 2021: Bali United\n* 2022: Persib Bandung\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\nThe following are the top five teams in Liga 1 by points earned:\n\n* Persipura Jayapura (1,101 points)\n* Persib Bandung (811 points)\n* Arema FC (744 points)\n* Persebaya Surabaya (738 points)\n* Bali United (713 points)\n\n### 2024â25 season\n\nThe 2024â25 Liga 1 season is expected to feature 18 teams competing in a double round-robin format.\n\n### Maps\n\nThe following is a map showing the location of the teams competing in Liga 1:\n\n* North Sumatra: PSMS Medan\n* South Sumatra: Persika Bangka\n* Lampung: Persewangi Babel\n* Banten: Persikab Bandung\n* West Java: Persib Bandung\n* Central Java: PSIS Semarang\n* East Java: Persebaya Surabaya\n* Bali: Bali United\n* East Nusa Tenggara: Arema FC\n* West Nusa Tenggara: PSPS Pekanbaru\n* Riau: PSMS Medan\n* Jambi: PSMS Medan\n* South Kalimantan: Persekabpas Pasuruan\n* Central Kalimantan: Persewangi Babel\n* South Sulawesi: PSM Makassar\n* North Sulawesi: Persipura Jayapura\n* Papua: Persipura Jayapura\n* Maluku: PSPS Pekanbaru\n\n## Former clubs\n\nThe following are some of the former clubs that have competed in Liga 1:\n\n* Persewangi Babel\n* PSPS Pekanbaru\n* PSMS Medan\n* Persika Bangka\n* Persekabpas Pasuruan\n* Persipura Jayapura\n\n## All-time Liga 1 table\n\nThe following is an all-time table of Liga 1:\n\n| Rank | Team | Points |\n| 1 | Persipura Jayapura | 1,101 |\n| 2 | Persib Bandung | 811 |\n| 3 | Arema FC | 744 |\n| 4 | Persebaya Surabaya | 738 |\n| 5 | Bali United | 713 |\n\n## Foreign players\n\nThe following are some of the foreign players who have competed in Liga 1:\n\n* Diogo LuÃ­s Santo (Brazil)\n* Bruno AraÃºjo (Brazil)\n* Diogo Andrade (Brazil)\n* Fernando Gabriel (Brazil)\n* Jefferson Baiano (Brazil)\n* Manoel (Brazil)\n* MÃ¡rio SÃ©rgio (Brazil)\n* Renan Marques (Brazil)\n* Wellington (Brazil)\n* Dejan ÄokiÄ (Serbia)\n* Nemanja VuÄiÄeviÄ (Serbia)\n* Stefan Å½ivkoviÄ (Serbia)\n* Nikola ÄurÄeviÄ (Serbia)\n* JÃºnior Alves (Brazil)\n\n## Awards\n\n### Top scorers\n\nThe following are the top scorers in Liga 1:\n\n* 1994: Husni (Persekabpas Pasuruan) -

The film is based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film centers around Oppenheimer's life, from his early days as a young and ambitious scientist to his appointment as the director of the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for developing the atomic bomb. The film explores the moral and psychological complexities of Oppenheimer's journey, as he navigates the tensions between his scientific pursuits and the catastrophic consequences of his work.\n\nThe film also delves into Oppenheimer's personal life, including his relationships with his wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen, and his lover, Jean Tatlock. The film portrays the strain that Oppenheimer's work and personal life put on his relationships, particularly with his wife, who struggles to cope with the secrecy and danger surrounding her husband's work.\n\nThroughout the film, Oppenheimer grapples with the ethics of his work, as he comes to realize the devastating consequences of the atomic bomb. The film's climax depicts Oppenheimer's testimony before the Atomic Energy Commission, where he is questioned about his role in the development of the bomb and his involvement in the Trinity test.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer\n* Emily Blunt as Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen Oppenheimer\n* Matt Damon as Leslie Groves\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss\n* Benny Safdie as Edward Teller\n* Rami Malek as David Greenglass\n* Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence\n* Dane DeHaan as Kenneth Nichols\n* Alden Ehrenreich as Richard Feynman\n* Jack Quaid as Robert Bacher\n* Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nOppenheimer has been in development for several years, with Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas initially attached to the project in 2014. Nolan had long been fascinated by the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and he saw the film as an opportunity to explore the complexities of Oppenheimer's character and the historical context of the Manhattan Project.\n\n### Writing\n\nNolan and Thomas co-wrote the screenplay for Oppenheimer, drawing on a wide range of sources, including Oppenheimer's own writings and the accounts of his colleagues and friends. The script underwent several drafts, with Nolan and Thomas working closely with the film's producers and other members of the cast and crew to develop the story and characters.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Oppenheimer was a long and complex one, with Nolan and Thomas working to assemble a talented ensemble cast that could bring the film's complex characters to life. Cillian Murphy was the first actor to be cast in the title role, followed by Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Oppenheimer began in April 2022 and continued for several months, with Nolan and his team shooting on location in various parts of the United States, including Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C.

Open-source games are characterized by their free availability and modifiability, allowing users to modify and distribute the game's source code.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games are part of the broader open-source software movement, which emphasizes the sharing and collaborative development of software. In contrast to proprietary games, which are owned and controlled by a single entity, open-source games are often developed by communities of contributors who work together to create and improve the game.\n\nOne key aspect that differentiates open-source games from other forms of open-source software is their interactive nature. Unlike static software applications, video games are dynamic systems that rely on complex algorithms, graphics, and sound design to create an immersive experience. This requires a high level of multidisciplinary collaboration among developers, designers, artists, and testers.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of open-source video games has its roots in the early days of computing, when hobbyists and enthusiasts would share and modify code for various projects. However, the modern open-source game movement began to take shape in the 1990s, with the rise of the internet and online communities.\n\nDuring this time, developers such as id Software and Epic Games released their games' source code under open-source licenses, allowing others to study, modify, and distribute the code. This move helped to foster a sense of community and collaboration among gamers and developers, laying the groundwork for the open-source game movement.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source game is often credited to be _Colossal Cave Adventure_, a text-based adventure game developed in the late 1970s by Will Crowther. However, it was not until the 1990s that open-source games began to gain widespread attention.\n\nOne of the earliest notable open-source games was _Wolfenstein 3D_, released in 1992 by id Software. This 3D first-person shooter was a groundbreaking game that showcased the potential of 3D graphics. The game's source code was later released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), allowing others to modify and distribute the code.\n\nOther early open-source games include _Doom_ (1993) and _Quake_ (1996), both developed by id Software. These games helped to establish the open-source game movement and paved the way for future developments.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw a significant increase in the popularity of 3D games and open-source development. Games such as _Quake III Arena_ (1999) and _Unreal Tournament_ (1999) were released with source code, allowing developers to create custom levels, mods, and tools.\n\nThe open-source game engine _Quake Engine_ was also developed during this time, providing a platform for developers to create their own 3D games. This engine was later used as the basis for other open-source games, such as _Duke Nukem 3D_ (2001) and _Heretic_ (2001).\n\n### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe mid-2000s saw a significant increase in the popularity of open-source games, with the release of games such as _OpenTomb_ (2003) and _Cube 2: Sauerbraten_ (2004). These games showcased the potential of open-source development and helped to establish the genre as a viable option for gamers.\n\nThe rise of online communities, social media, and crowdfunding platforms also contributed to the growth of the open-source game movement. Developers were able to connect with gamers, share their projects, and raise funds for development, creating a sense of community and collaboration.\n\n### Greater organization\n\nAs the open-source game movement grew, so did the need for organization and coordination. In 2008, the Open Source Game Development Foundation (OSGDF) was established to provide a platform for open-source game developers to collaborate, share resources, and promote their projects.\n\nThe OSGDF also helped to establish the OpenGameArt.net project, which provides a repository of open-source game assets, including graphics, sound effects, and music. This resource has been instrumental in helping developers create their own open-source games.\n\n### Hubs and development teams\n\nToday, the open-source game movement is characterized by a diverse range of hubs and development teams. From the popular _Quake Engine_ to the more recent _Godot Engine_, there are numerous platforms available for developers to create and share their games.\n\nThe rise of online communities, such as _Reddit_'s r/open-source-gaming, has also helped to foster a sense of community and collaboration among gamers and developers. These communities provide a space for developers to share their projects, receive feedback, and connect with others who share their interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the open-source video game movement has come a long way since its inception in the 1990s. From humble beginnings to the widespread popularity of today, open-source games have become a viable option for gamers and developers alike. As the genre continues to grow and evolve, it will be exciting to see what the future holds for this dynamic and innovative community.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Open-source software\n* Free and open-source game engines\n* Indie game development\n* Game development communities\n\n**External links**\n\n* OpenGameArt.net\n* Open Source Game Development Foundation (OSGDF)\n* Quake Engine\n* Godot Engine\n* Reddit's r/open-source-gaming", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Ralph Fiennes, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Nicholas Hoult, and follows a young couple who become embroiled in a culinary nightmare at a remote island restaurant.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Tyler (Nicholas Hoult), a food blogger who brings his girlfriend, Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy), to a remote island restaurant for a romantic getaway. The restaurant, called Hawthorne, is owned and operated by Chef Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes), a master of fine dining with a reputation for being one of the best in the world. Upon arrival, the couple is greeted by Chef Slowik, who explains that the restaurant's menu is a carefully curated selection of dishes that will be served to them over the course of the evening.\n\nHowever, as the evening progresses, it becomes clear that something is off. The food is exquisite, but the service is cold and detached, and the other diners seem to be trapped in some sort of twisted game. As Tyler and Margot try to make sense of what is happening, they begin to realize that they are part of a sinister experiment designed by Chef Slowik to push the boundaries of culinary art.\n\nAs the night wears on, the couple becomes increasingly desperate to escape the island and the clutches of Chef Slowik, but they soon discover that they are trapped and that the only way to survive is to play along with the chef's twisted game.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe Menu features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Ralph Fiennes as Chef Julian Slowik\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot\n* Nicholas Hoult as Tyler\n* Janet McTeer as Elsa\n* John Leguizamo as George\n* Reed Birney as Richard\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe Menu was first conceived by Mark Mylod in 2019, who was inspired by his own experiences in the culinary world. Mylod, who is a self-proclaimed foodie, was fascinated by the idea of a restaurant as a microcosm of society, where the rules and norms of the outside world are twisted and distorted.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for The Menu was a long and arduous one, with Mylod working closely with the actors to develop their characters and bring them to life on screen. Ralph Fiennes, who plays the role of Chef Slowik, was drawn to the project because of the complexity and depth of the character. \"I was intrigued by the idea of a chef who is a master of fine dining, but also a master manipulator,\" Fiennes said in an interview.\n\n## Filming\n\nThe Menu was shot on location in Ireland and the UK, with a cast and crew of over 100 people. The film was shot on a combination of digital and film stock, with a color palette that is both vibrant and muted.\n\n## Music\n\nThe score for The Menu was composed by Cristobal Tapia de Veer, who is known for his work on films such as The Handmaiden and The Lobster. The score is a haunting and atmospheric blend of electronic and orchestral elements, perfectly capturing the mood and tone of the film.\n\n# Release\n\nThe Menu premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, where it received widespread critical acclaim. The film was later released in theaters on October 14, 2022, and was a commercial success, grossing over $15 million in its opening weekend.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box Office\n\nThe Menu was a commercial success, grossing over $65 million worldwide. The film was a hit with audiences, who praised its originality and its thought-provoking themes.\n\n## Critical Response\n\nThe Menu received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the performances of the cast, particularly Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy. The film has a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many praising its originality and its thought-provoking themes.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe Menu has received numerous accolades, including several nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress at the 2023 Independent Spirit Awards.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Menu is a thought-provoking and original film that challenges viewers to think about the nature of reality and the role of food in society. The film's use of satire and social commentary adds depth and complexity to the narrative, making it a must-see for fans of horror and culinary culture alike.\n\n# References\n\nNone.\n\n# External links\n\n* The Menu (2022 film) on IMDb\n* The Menu (2022 film) at Rotten Tomatoes\n* The Menu (2022 film) at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Menu_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the result of a constitutional crisis that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who had been in office since February 2021.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was called after the center-left government of Mario Draghi collapsed in July 2022, following a series of scandals and disagreements within the coalition. The government had been formed in February 2021, following the resignation of the previous government led by Giuseppe Conte. Draghi's government had been a center-left coalition of the Democratic Party (PD), the Five Star Movement (M5S), and the League, with the support of the centre-right Forza Italia party.\n\nThe collapse of the Draghi government led to a new election, which was seen as a referendum on the Italian establishment and the economic policies of the past few years. The election was also seen as a test for the new electoral system introduced in 2020, which aimed to reduce the power of the traditional parties and give more representation to smaller parties.\n\n**Electoral campaign**\n\nThe electoral campaign was marked by a series of debates and discussions between the main parties. The debates were broadcast on television and were seen by millions of Italians. The main parties' slogans were:\n\n* **Democratic Party (PD)**: \" Unity, Change, Future\" (Italian: \"UnitÃ , Cambiamento, Futuro\")\n* **Five Star Movement (M5S)**: \"The People, the Planet, the Country\" (Italian: \"Il Popolo, il Pianeta, il Paese\")\n* **League**: \"For Italy\" (Italian: \"Per l'Italia\")\n* **Forza Italia**: \"United We Can\" (Italian: \"Uniti Possiamo\")\n* **Brothers of Italy** (FdI): \"For the Nation\" (Italian: \"Per la Nazione\")\n\nThe electoral debates were widely covered by the media and were seen as an important moment in the campaign. The debates were marked by disagreements between the main parties, particularly between the PD and the M5S, which had been allies in the previous government.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Italian electoral system is a mixed system, which combines proportional representation (PR) with a first-past-the-post (FPTP) system. The country is divided into 100 constituencies, which are allocated to the Chamber of Deputies. The constituencies are further divided into 4-6 electoral districts, which are allocated to the Senate. The electoral system aims to give more representation to smaller parties and to reduce the power of the traditional parties.\n\n**Electoral lists**\n\nThe main parties presented the following electoral lists:\n\n### **Lists with parliamentary representation**\n\n* **League**: 1,023,494 votes (9.8% of the total); 65 seats\n* **Forza Italia**: 1,007,449 votes (9.5% of the total); 65 seats\n* **Brothers of Italy**: 1,055,610 votes (10.0% of the total); 66 seats\n* **Five Star Movement**: 7,357,761 votes (69.6% of the total); 93 seats\n* **Democratic Party**: 5,373,225 votes (50.7% of the total); 81 seats\n\n### **Lists without parliamentary representation**\n\n* **Italia Viva**: 1,344,111 votes (12.7% of the total)\n* **Action**: 1,222,045 votes (11.6% of the total)\n* **Green Federation**: 531,973 votes (5.0% of the total)\n\n### **Lists running only in overseas constituencies**\n\n* **PiÃ¹ Europa**: 21,510 votes (0.2% of the total); 1 seat\n* **Partito Socialista Italiano**: 16,321 votes (0.2% of the total)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe opinion polls were widely covered by the media and were seen as an important moment in the campaign. The polls were conducted by several research institutes, including the Ipsos Institute, the Eurobarometer, and the SWG Institute. The polls showed a clear lead for the Five Star Movement, which was seen as the clear winner of the election.\n\n**Voter turnout**\n\nThe voter turnout was 68.3%, which was higher than the 2018 election. The voter turnout was seen as a positive sign for the democratic process and was widely praised by the parties.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the election were as follows:\n\n### **Chamber of Deputies**\n\n#### **Overall results**\n\nThe Five Star Movement won 93 seats, followed by the Democratic Party with 81 seats.

It is a philosophical and metaphysical system that was developed by a group of philosophers who were influenced by the teachings of Plato and the ancient Greek tradition of philosophy. Neoplatonism is characterized by its emphasis on the concept of the One, the idea of emanations, and the notion of a celestial hierarchy.\n\nOrigins of the term\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was first used by the German philosopher and historian Friedrich Schleiermacher in the 19th century to describe the philosophical system of Plotinus. However, the term is not used by the Neoplatonists themselves, who referred to their system as \"the philosophy of the One\" or \"the divine philosophy\".\n\nOrigins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n\nHellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the 3rd century AD, a time of great cultural and philosophical ferment in the Roman Empire. The Hellenistic period, which had begun in the 4th century BC, was characterized by the spread of Greek culture and philosophy throughout the Mediterranean world. The Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics had established themselves as major philosophical schools, and the Academy and the Lyceum, founded by Plato and Aristotle respectively, remained important centers of learning.\n\nAmmonius Saccas\n\nThe founder of Neoplatonism is generally considered to be Ammonius Saccas, a philosopher who lived in Alexandria in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries AD. Little is known about Ammonius' life, but it is believed that he was a Christian who was influenced by the teachings of Plato and the Pythagoreans. He is said to have founded a school in Alexandria, where he taught a group of students, including Plotinus.\n\nPlotinus\n\nPlotinus was born in Egypt in 205 AD and studied under Ammonius Saccas in Alexandria. He traveled to Rome in 244 AD, where he founded a school and began to develop his philosophical system. Plotinus is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Neoplatonism, and his teachings had a profound influence on the development of the school. He is best known for his concept of the One, which he saw as the ultimate reality and the source of all existence.\n\nPorphyry\n\nPorphyry was a student of Plotinus and one of the most important figures in the history of Neoplatonism. He was born in Tyre in 234 AD and studied under Plotinus in Rome. Porphyry was a prolific writer and composed a number of important works, including the Isagoge, which is a survey of the categories of being. He also wrote a biography of Plotinus, which is an important source of information about the philosopher's life and teachings.\n\nIamblichus\n\nIamblichus was a Neoplatonist who lived in the 4th century AD and was a student of Porphyry. He is best known for his concept of theurgy, which is a spiritual practice that involves the use of rituals and sacraments to attain union with the divine. Iamblichus also wrote a number of important works, including the De Mysteriis, which is a treatise on the nature of the mysteries.\n\nAcademies\n\nThe Neoplatonists established a number of academies throughout the Roman Empire, where they taught their philosophical system to students. The most famous of these academies was the Academy of Athens, which was founded by Plotinus and was located in the heart of the city. The Academy of Athens was a major center of learning and attracted students from all over the Mediterranean world.\n\nHypatia\n\nHypatia was a Neoplatonist who lived in the 4th century AD and was a student of Theon of Alexandria. She was a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who was known for her wisdom and her beauty. Hypatia was martyred in 415 AD by a mob of Christians who were opposed to her philosophical teachings.\n\nProclus\n\nProclus was a Neoplatonist who lived in the 5th century AD and was a student of Plutarch of Athens. He was a philosopher and mathematician who is best known for his concept of the One, which he saw as the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. Proclus also wrote a number of important works, including the Elements of Theology, which is a treatise on the nature of the divine.\n\nIdeas\n\nThe One\n\nThe concept of the One is central to the philosophy of Neoplatonism. The One is seen as the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. It is the unity and the multiplicity of the One that gives rise to the various aspects of reality, including the material world and the spiritual realm.\n\nEmanations\n\nThe Neoplatonists believed that the One emanated into the world through a series of intermediate principles, including the Demiurge or nous, the world-soul, and the phenomenal world.\n\nDemiurge or nous\n\nThe Demiurge or nous is the intermediate principle between the One and the material world. It is the creative principle that gives shape and form to the material world. The Demiurge is often seen as a divine being, but it is not the ultimate reality.\n\nWorld-soul\n\nThe world-soul is the intermediate principle between the Demiurge and the material world. It is the animating principle that gives life and vitality to the material world. The world-soul is often seen as a divine being, but it is not the ultimate reality.\n\nPhenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world is the material world that is perceived through the senses. It is the world of objects and events that is subject to the laws of causality and the principles of logic.\n\nCelestial hierarchy\n\nThe Neoplatonists believed in a celestial hierarchy that consists of a series of intermediate principles, including the spheres and the stars. The celestial hierarchy is seen as a reflection of the divine order and the structure of the universe.\n\nEvil\n\nThe Neoplatonists believed that evil is an absence of being, rather than a positive entity. They saw evil as a privation of the good, rather than a substance that exists in its own right.\n\nReturn to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Neoplatonist is to return to the One, which is the ultimate reality and the source of all existence. The return to the One is seen as a process of spiritual purification and ascension, in which the individual soul is reunited with the divine.\n\nInfluence\n\nEarly Christianity\n\nThe Neoplatonists had a profound influence on the development of early Christianity. Many of the early Christian Fathers, including Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius, were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. The concept of the One and the idea of emanations were particularly influential in the development of Christian theology.\n\nAugustine\n\nAugustine was a Christian philosopher who was influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. He saw the Neoplatonists as a source of wisdom and insight, and he often incorporated their ideas into his own philosophical system.\n\nOrigen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen and Pseudo-Dionysius were both Christian philosophers who were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. Origen saw the Neoplatonists as a source of wisdom and insight, and he often incorporated their ideas into his own philosophical system. Pseudo-Dionysius, on the other hand, saw the Neoplatonists as a source of spiritual guidance and wisdom.\n\nGnosticism\n\nThe Neoplatonists also had an influence on the development of Gnosticism, a philosophical and religious movement that emerged in the 1st century AD. The Gnostics saw the material world as an illusion and the ultimate reality as a divine being, which is similar to the Neoplatonist view.\n\nByzantine education\n\nThe Neoplatonists played a major role in the development of Byzantine education. They established a number of academies and schools throughout the Byzantine Empire, where they taught their philosophical system to students.\n\nIslamic neoplatonism\n\nThe Neoplatonists also had an influence on the development of Islamic philosophy. Many of the early Islamic philosophers, including Al-Kindi and Avicenna, were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. The concept of the One and the idea of emanations were particularly influential in the development of Islamic philosophy.\n\nJewish thought\n\nThe Neoplatonists also had an influence on the development of Jewish thought. Many of the Jewish philosophers, including Saadia Gaon and Maimonides, were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. The concept of the One and the idea of emanations were particularly influential in the development of Jewish philosophy.\n\nMedieval Christian Thought\n\nThe Neoplatonists also had an influence on the development of medieval Christian thought. Many of the medieval Christian philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. The concept of the One and the idea of emanations were particularly influential in the development of medieval Christian philosophy.\n\nWestern Renaissance\n\nThe Neoplatonists also had an influence on the development of the Western Renaissance. Many of the Renaissance humanists, including Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists. The concept of the One and the idea of emanations were particularly influential in the development of Renaissance philosophy.\n\nCambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Neoplatonists also had an influence on the development of the Cambridge Platonists, a group of philosophers who were active in the 17th century. The Cambridge Platonists, including Ralph Cudworth and Henry More, were influenced by the teachings of the Neoplatonists and saw the concept of the One as the ultimate reality and the source of all existence.\n\nModern neoplatonism\n\nModern neoplatonism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century. It is a revival of the classical Neoplatonist ideas and a new interpretation of the concept of the One. Modern neoplatonism is characterized by its emphasis on the concept of the One, the idea of emanations, and the notion of a celestial hierarchy.\n\nSee also\n\n* Neo-Pythagoreanism\n* Gnosticism\n* Hermeticism\n* Manichaeism\n* Neopaganism\n* Platonism\n* Renaissance humanism\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Coombes, A.

From its humble beginnings in the 19th century to the present day, Ukrainian opera has evolved significantly, influenced by various cultural and artistic movements. This article provides an overview of the development of opera in Ukraine, highlighting its key milestones, notable composers, and the challenges it faced.\n\n**Origins**\n\nUkrainian opera originated in the mid-19th century, influenced by Western and Russian musical traditions. The early beginnings of Ukrainian opera can be attributed to three distinct genres: ShkilÊ¹na dramy (school dramas), Vertepy (nativity scenes), and vaudeville.\n\n### ShkilÊ¹na dramy (school dramas)\n\nShkilÊ¹na dramy, also known as \"school dramas,\" emerged in the early 19th century as a form of amateur theater. These productions were typically performed by students and teachers in Ukrainian-language schools. ShkilÊ¹na dramy often featured folk motifs, with simple melodies and lyrics, and were an essential part of Ukrainian cultural education.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nVertepy, a type of nativity scene, was another precursor to Ukrainian opera. These elaborate tableaux often featured live actors, music, and costumes, depicting scenes from Ukrainian folklore. Vertepy was a popular form of entertainment during the Christmas season, and its influence can be seen in later Ukrainian operas.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a popular form of entertainment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also played a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera. Ukrainian vaudeville troupes performed a range of musical and theatrical genres, including operetta, ballet, and drama. These troupes helped to establish a Ukrainian musical identity and paved the way for the emergence of opera.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a genre that combines opera and musical theater, was a significant influence on the development of Ukrainian opera. Ukrainian operetta emerged in the late 19th century, with composers such as Nikolai Lysenko and Mykola Drahomanov creating works that blended Ukrainian folk music with Western operatic traditions.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the emergence of Ukrainian operetta and the growing popularity of Ukrainian music, several obstacles hindered the development of Ukrainian-language opera. These included:\n\n* Lack of institutional support: Ukrainian opera houses and theaters were often underfunded and lacked the resources to produce and promote Ukrainian-language opera.\n* Cultural and linguistic discrimination: Ukrainian-language opera was often viewed as inferior to Russian-language opera, and Ukrainian-language productions were frequently canceled or postponed.\n* Competition from Russian opera: The Russian Empire's dominance of the opera scene in Ukraine meant that Ukrainian-language opera had to compete with Russian-language productions for audiences and resources.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ukrainian opera began to emerge in the late 19th century, with Nikolai Lysenko and his contemporaries and successors playing a key role in its development.\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko (1842-1912) was a Ukrainian composer, conductor, and pianist who is often credited with establishing Ukrainian opera as a distinct genre. Lysenko's operas, such as \"Taras Bulba\" and \"Natalka Poltavka,\" combined Ukrainian folk music with Western operatic traditions, creating a unique and authentic Ukrainian operatic style.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including Mykola Drahomanov, Stepan Lykov, and Vitaliy Hubarenko, also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. These composers and performers helped to establish Ukrainian opera as a distinct genre, with its own unique style and traditions.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\nUkrainian opera experienced a period of resurgence in the early 20th century, with a new generation of composers and performers emerging.\n\n### 1910s\n\nDuring the 1910s, Ukrainian opera began to gain popularity, with a series of successful productions and tours. This period saw the emergence of new composers, such as Vitaliy Hubarenko and Stepan Lykov, who created works that blended Ukrainian folk music with modern operatic styles.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s were a period of significant growth and development for Ukrainian opera. This period saw the establishment of new opera houses and theaters, and the emergence of new composers, such as Boris Liatoshynskyi and Mykola Kolessa, who created works that were influenced by Russian and European operatic traditions.\n\n### Historical opera\n\nHistorical opera, a genre that tells the story of a particular historical period or event, emerged in the early 20th century. Ukrainian historical opera often focused on the country's struggle for independence and its rich cultural heritage. Composers such as Mykola Kolessa and Boris Liatoshynskyi created works that were influenced by Russian and European operatic traditions, while also incorporating Ukrainian folk music and themes.\n\n**Stalinism (1932â1956)**\n\nDuring the Stalin period, Ukrainian opera faced significant challenges. The Soviet government's cultural policies were designed to suppress Ukrainian nationalism and promote Russian culture. Many Ukrainian opera houses and theaters were closed, and performances were frequently canceled or postponed.\n\n### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukrainian opera was severely disrupted. Many opera houses and theaters were destroyed, and many performers and composers were forced to flee or go into hiding.\n\n### 1945â1953\n\nFollowing World War II, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of recovery and growth. New opera houses and theaters were established, and a new generation of composers and performers emerged. This period saw the emergence of new styles and genres, including the development of Ukrainian folk opera.\n\n**1953â1991**\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1991 was marked by significant changes in Ukrainian opera. The Soviet government's cultural policies changed, and Ukrainian opera was no longer suppressed. Instead, it was encouraged and promoted as a key part of Ukrainian cultural identity.\n\n### 1953â1970\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of growth and development. New opera houses and theaters were established, and a new generation of composers and performers emerged. This period saw the emergence of new styles and genres, including the development of Ukrainian folk opera.\n\n### 1970s\n\nThe 1970s were a period of significant change for Ukrainian opera. The Soviet government's cultural policies were relaxed, and Ukrainian opera was no longer suppressed. Instead, it was encouraged and promoted as a key part of Ukrainian cultural identity.\n\n### 1980s\n\nThe 1980s were a period of significant growth and development for Ukrainian opera. New opera houses and theaters were established, and a new generation of composers and performers emerged. This period saw the emergence of new styles and genres, including the development of Ukrainian contemporary opera.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nFollowing Ukraine's independence in 1991, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of significant growth and development. New opera houses and theaters were established, and a new generation of composers and performers emerged. This period saw the emergence of new styles and genres, including the development of Ukrainian contemporary opera.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has a number of opera houses and theaters that are dedicated to the performance of opera. These include:\n\n* The National Opera of Ukraine, located in Kyiv\n* The Lviv Opera House, located in Lviv\n* The Kharkiv Opera House, located in Kharkiv\n\nThese opera houses and theaters have a rich history and have played a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n**References**\n\n* Notes\n* Citations\n* Sources\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* The development of Ukrainian opera is a complex and multifaceted topic, and there are a number of resources available for further reading.\n\n**External links**\n\n* National Opera of Ukraine\n* Lviv Opera House\n* Kharkiv Opera House", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##ShkilÊ¹na dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932â1956)\n##World War II\n##1945â1953\n#1953â1991\n##1953â1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The reports provide insight into the company's content moderation practices, interactions with government agencies, and controversies surrounding the platform's impact on public discourse.\n\n**Background**\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, has grown into one of the most influential social media platforms worldwide. With over 440 million monthly active users, Twitter has become a major hub for real-time information and a key platform for public figures, politicians, and journalists. As the platform has grown, so have concerns about its content moderation policies, transparency, and interactions with government agencies.\n\n**Topics**\n\n### **No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story**\n\nIn October 2020, Twitter faced backlash for restricting access to a New York Post story about Hunter Biden, son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. The story claimed that Hunter Biden had engaged in corrupt business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company. Twitter initially restricted access to the story, citing concerns about the accuracy of the information. The move was criticized by many, who argued that it was an example of Twitter's biased content moderation practices.\n\nThe incident highlighted the challenges Twitter faces in balancing its commitment to free speech with the need to protect users from misinformation. Twitter ultimately reversed its decision, but the incident sparked a wider debate about the platform's content moderation policies.\n\n### **No. 2: Visibility filtering**\n\nIn 2022, journalist Matt Taibbi published a report on Twitter's visibility filtering practices. The report revealed that Twitter had been using algorithms to filter out tweets from certain users, making them less visible to other users. The practice, known as \"visibility filtering,\" was used to suppress tweets that Twitter deemed to be \"harmful\" or \"abusive.\"\n\nThe report sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of censorship and bias. Twitter argued that the practice was necessary to maintain a safe and healthy online environment.\n\n### **Nos. 3â5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump**\n\nIn January 2021, a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol, leading to the suspension of Donald Trump's Twitter account. Twitter cited its policy against \"glorifying violence\" as the reason for the suspension.\n\nThe incident highlighted the challenges Twitter faces in balancing its commitment to free speech with the need to protect users from harm. Twitter's decision to suspend Trump's account sparked controversy, with many accusing the platform of censoring a sitting president.\n\n### **Nos. 6â7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team**\n\nIn 2022, journalist Matt Taibbi published a report on communications between the FBI and Twitter's Trust and Safety Team. The report revealed that the FBI had been in regular contact with Twitter, asking the platform to remove or restrict access to certain tweets and accounts.\n\nThe report sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with the government to suppress free speech. Twitter argued that the communications were necessary to maintain a safe and healthy online environment.\n\n### **Nos. 8â9: Relationship with the U.S. government**\n\nTwitter's relationship with the U.S. government has been the subject of controversy in recent years. In 2020, it was reported that Twitter had been working closely with the U.S. government to identify and remove \"bot\" accounts from the platform.\n\nThe report sparked controversy, with many accusing Twitter of collaborating with the government to suppress dissenting voices. Twitter argued that the cooperation was necessary to maintain the integrity of the platform.\n\n### **No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content**\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter faced criticism for its moderation of content related to the virus. The platform was accused of censoring information about the virus and its treatments, leading to concerns about the suppression of free speech.\n\nTwitter argued that the moderation was necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation about the virus.\n\n### **No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard**\n\nThe Hamilton 68 Dashboard is a tool developed by the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a non-partisan think tank. The dashboard tracks the activity of Twitter accounts suspected of being linked to Russian propaganda efforts.\n\nThe dashboard has been criticized for its methodology and accuracy, with some accusing it of being biased against conservative voices.\n\n### **No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans**\n\nTwitter has been accused of censoring insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. The platform has been criticized for its inconsistent application of its rules, with some accusing it of favoring liberal voices.\n\n### **No. 17: Global Engagement Center**\n\nThe Global Engagement Center is a U.S. government agency tasked with countering online propaganda efforts. Twitter has been criticized for its interactions with the agency, with some accusing it of collaborating with the government to suppress dissenting voices.\n\n### **No. 19: The Virality Project**\n\nThe Virality Project is a reporting initiative that tracks the spread of misinformation on social media.

This system is designed to minimize the spoiler effect and promote more inclusive and representative elections.\n\nUsage\n\n### Top-four\n\nThe top-four primary is used in some states in the United States, including Alaska and Missouri. In these states, all candidates, regardless of party, run against each other in the primary election. The top four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election.\n\n#### Alaska\n\nAlaska was the first state to adopt the top-four primary system, which was implemented in 2020. The system was put into effect through a ballot initiative approved by voters in 2020. The top-four primary has been credited with increasing voter turnout and reducing the spoiler effect in Alaska's elections.\n\n#### Missouri\n\nMissouri adopted the top-four primary system in 2020, following the lead of Alaska. The system was implemented through a state law passed in 2020. Missouri's top-four primary has been seen as a way to promote more inclusive and representative elections in the state.\n\n### Top-five\n\nSome states, such as Nevada, use a top-five primary system, where the top five candidates advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but allows for more candidates to advance to the general election.\n\n#### Nevada\n\nNevada uses a top-five primary system, which was implemented in 2020. The system allows all candidates, regardless of party, to run against each other in the primary election. The top five candidates with the most votes advance to the general election.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe top-four primary has several benefits, including:\n\n* Reduced spoiler effect: By allowing all candidates to run against each other in the primary election, the top-four primary reduces the spoiler effect, where a third-party candidate splits the vote and allows the other candidate to win.\n* Increased voter turnout: The top-four primary has been credited with increasing voter turnout, as voters feel more confident that their vote will count.\n* More inclusive elections: The top-four primary promotes more inclusive elections, as all candidates, regardless of party, have an equal chance of advancing to the general election.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe top-four primary also has several drawbacks, including:\n\n### Vote splitting\n\nVote splitting occurs when a third-party candidate splits the vote, allowing the other candidate to win. The top-four primary reduces the risk of vote splitting, as all candidates, regardless of party, have an equal chance of advancing to the general election.\n\n#### Primary\n\nIn the primary election, vote splitting can occur when two or more candidates from the same party run against each other. The top-four primary reduces the risk of vote splitting, as all candidates, regardless of party, have an equal chance of advancing to the general election.\n\n#### General\n\nIn the general election, vote splitting can occur when a third-party candidate splits the vote, allowing the other candidate to win. The top-four primary reduces the risk of vote splitting, as all candidates, regardless of party, have an equal chance of advancing to the general election.\n\n### Voter deception\n\nThe top-four primary has been criticized for voter deception, where voters are misled into voting for a candidate who is not their first choice. This can occur when a voter votes for a candidate who is not their first choice, but is the only candidate that can beat their least favorite candidate.\n\nVariations\n\nThere are several variations of the top-four primary, including:\n\n### Final Five Voting\n\nSome states use a final five voting system, where the top five candidates advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but allows for more candidates to advance to the general election.\n\n### Primary\n\nSome states use a primary election system, where the top two candidates from each party advance to the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but only allows candidates from each party to advance to the general election.\n\n### Post-primary\n\nSome states use a post-primary system, where the top two candidates from each party advance to the general election, but only after the primary election has taken place. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but only allows candidates from each party to advance to the general election.\n\n### General\n\nSome states use a general election system, where all candidates, regardless of party, run against each other in the general election. This system is similar to the top-four primary, but allows all candidates to run against each other in the general election.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe top-four primary is a type of primary election in which the top four candidates, regardless of party, advance to the general election. This system is designed to minimize the spoiler effect and promote more inclusive and representative elections. The top-four primary has several benefits, including reduced spoiler effect, increased voter turnout, and more inclusive elections. However, it also has several drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. Variations of the top-four primary include final five voting, primary, post-primary, and general elections.\n\nSee also\n\n* Primary election\n* General election\n* Electoral system\n* Voting system\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Alaska Division of Elections: Top Four Primary Election\n* Missouri Secretary of State: Top Four Primary Election\n* Nevada Secretary of State: Top Five Primary Election", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The invasion marked a significant escalation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which had been ongoing since 2014.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014, following the annexation of Crimea by Russia. The Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists clashed in the region, leading to a protracted and bloody conflict. In the years leading up to the full-scale invasion, tensions between Ukraine and Russia remained high, with periodic clashes and skirmishes along the border.\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, Russia began to build up its military presence along the Ukrainian border, deploying troops, tanks, and artillery to the region. Ukraine and its Western allies accused Russia of planning a large-scale invasion, while Russia denied any intention of invading its neighbor.\n\n**Initial invasion**\n\nOn 24 February 2022, at 5:00 am local time, Russia launched a large-scale military operation against Ukraine, with air and artillery strikes targeting Ukrainian military installations and cities across the country. The invasion was marked by a significant display of military might, with Russian forces using advanced technology and tactics to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses.\n\nThe initial invasion saw Russian forces make significant gains in the north and east of Ukraine, capturing key cities and infrastructure. The city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, was particularly hard hit, with Russian forces using artillery and air strikes to pound the city into submission.\n\n**Southeastern front**\n\nAs the initial invasion progressed, Russian forces turned their attention to the southeastern part of Ukraine, where they had previously clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. The southeastern front saw intense fighting as Russian forces clashed with Ukrainian troops in the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha.\n\nMariupol, a key port city in southeastern Ukraine, was besieged by Russian forces, who used artillery and air strikes to pound the city into submission. The city's defenders, including Ukrainian troops and civilian volunteers, put up fierce resistance, but were eventually forced to surrender.\n\n**2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives**\n\nAs the war dragged on, Ukraine launched a series of counteroffensives aimed at retaking lost territory and pushing Russian forces back. The counteroffensives saw Ukrainian forces make significant gains, particularly in the north and east of the country.\n\nOne of the most notable counteroffensives was launched in the Kharkiv region, where Ukrainian forces were able to retake key cities and territory from Russian forces. The counteroffensive saw Ukrainian troops use advanced tactics and technology to outmaneuver and outgun Russian forces.\n\n**Second stalemate**\n\nAs the war entered its second year, the conflict reached a stalemate, with both sides dug in and neither able to make significant gains. The stalemate was marked by periodic clashes and skirmishes, but no major advances or retreats.\n\nThe stalemate was due in part to the harsh winter conditions, which made it difficult for either side to launch major operations. However, it also reflected the increasingly entrenched nature of the conflict, with both sides relying on static defenses and waiting for the other side to make a mistake.\n\n**2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive**\n\nIn 2023, Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive aimed at retaking lost territory and pushing Russian forces back. The counteroffensive saw Ukrainian forces make significant gains, particularly in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.\n\nThe counteroffensive was marked by advanced tactics and technology, including the use of drones and precision-guided munitions. Ukrainian forces were able to outmaneuver and outgun Russian forces, retaking key cities and territory.\n\n**Second winter campaign**\n\nAs the war entered its second winter, both sides began to prepare for a new campaign. Russian forces continued to build up their military presence in the region, while Ukrainian forces launched a series of operations aimed at retaking lost territory and pushing Russian forces back.\n\nThe winter campaign saw both sides use advanced technology and tactics, including the use of drones and precision-guided munitions. Ukrainian forces were able to make significant gains, particularly in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukraine-Russia conflict\n* Donbas war\n* Kharkiv attack\n* Mariupol siege\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided as per the requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Ukraine Ministry of Defense\n* Russian Ministry of Defense\n* International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Prelude\n#Initial invasion\n#Southeastern front\n#2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives\n#Second stalemate\n#2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive\n#Second winter campaign\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The committee was formed on July 1, 2021, by a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives with a vote of 413-12.\n\n# History\n\nThe January 6 attack on the United States Capitol was a violent and unprecedented event in which a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building, attempting to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The attack resulted in five deaths, over 140 injuries, and extensive property damage. In the aftermath of the attack, there was widespread condemnation and outrage from lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and civil rights organizations.\n\nIn response to the attack, the House of Representatives voted to establish a select committee to investigate the events surrounding January 6. The committee was given broad authority to investigate the attack, including the actions of Trump and his associates, as well as the response of law enforcement agencies and other government officials.\n\n# Members\n\nThe select committee was composed of nine members, with five Democrats and four Republicans. The Democrats were:\n\n* Chairman Bennie Thompson (MS-02), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee\n* Jamie Raskin (MD-08), a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee\n* Elaine Luria (VA-02), a member of the House Armed Services Committee\n* Zoe Lofgren (CA-19), a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the House Administration Committee\n* Adam Schiff (CA-28), a member of the House Intelligence Committee\n\nThe Republicans were:\n\n* Representative Liz Cheney (WY-AT-Large), a member of the House Armed Services Committee\n* Representative Adam Kinzinger (IL-16), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee\n* Representative Jamie Herrera Beutler (WA-03), a member of the House Homeland Security Committee\n* Representative Tom Rice (SC-07), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe select committee conducted a comprehensive investigation into the January 6 attack, gathering evidence and testimony from hundreds of witnesses. The committee's investigation focused on several key areas, including the actions of Trump and his associates, the response of law enforcement agencies, and the role of extremist groups in the attack.\n\n## Simultaneous investigations by the Justice Department\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) conducted several investigations into the January 6 attack, including a grand jury investigation and a civil rights investigation. The DOJ also obtained several search warrants and issued subpoenas to individuals and organizations suspected of involvement in the attack.\n\n## Information received from Mark Meadows\n\nThe select committee obtained a significant amount of information from Mark Meadows, Trump's former chief of staff, through a deposition and document production. Meadows provided testimony and documents that shed light on Trump's knowledge and involvement in the events leading up to and during the attack.\n\n## Obstacles\n\nThe select committee faced several obstacles during its investigation, including:\n\n### Release of documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)\n\nThe select committee requested documents from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), but was initially denied access to some of the documents. The committee eventually obtained the documents, but not before Trump's lawyers intervened to try to block their release.\n\n### Republicans not testifying\n\nSeveral Republican members of the committee, including Representative Jim Jordan, refused to testify before the committee, claiming that the investigation was a \"witch hunt\" and that they had nothing to do with the attack.\n\n### Secret Service, DHS and Pentagon text messages deleted\n\nThe Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Pentagon deleted text messages and other communications related to the January 6 attack, which the select committee claimed was an obstruction of justice.\n\n### Trump funding legal defense of Republican witnesses\n\nTrump funded the legal defense of several Republican witnesses who were subpoenaed by the committee, which critics claimed was an attempt to intimidate and silence witnesses.\n\n### Republican National Committee (RNC) claiming committee is illegitimate\n\nThe Republican National Committee (RNC) claimed that the select committee was illegitimate and that its findings should not be taken seriously.\n\n# Public findings\n\nThe select committee held several public hearings throughout 2021 and 2022, during which it presented evidence and testimony from witnesses. The committee's public findings were summarized in several reports, which were released to the public.\n\n## 2021 public hearings\n\nThe select committee held its first public hearing on July 27, 2021, during which it presented testimony from several witnesses, including a former White House aide who described Trump's behavior on January 6 as \"erratic\" and \"very concerning.\"\n\n## 2022 public hearings\n\nThe select committee held several public hearings in 2022, during which it presented evidence and testimony from witnesses, including a former Trump campaign aide who described Trump's knowledge of the attack and his efforts to try to stop it.\n\n## Criminal referrals\n\nThe select committee made several criminal referrals to the DOJ, including referrals for conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and contempt of Congress. The committee also referred Trump and several of his allies to the DOJ for investigation and potential prosecution.\n\n### Impact on other investigations\n\nThe select committee's investigation had a significant impact on other investigations, including the investigation into the January 6 attack by the House Oversight Committee. The select committee's findings were also referenced in several other investigations, including the investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government documents.\n\n## Witness testimony transcripts\n\nThe select committee released several witness testimony transcripts, which provided a detailed account of the events surrounding January 6. The transcripts included testimony from several key witnesses, including a former White House aide who described Trump's behavior on January 6 as \"erratic\" and \"very concerning.\"\n\n# Final report\n\nThe select committee released its final report on December 22, 2022, which summarized the committee's findings and conclusions. The report was a comprehensive account of the events surrounding January 6 and provided a detailed analysis of the causes and consequences of the attack.\n\n## Before publication\n\nThe select committee had been working on the final report for several months, gathering evidence and testimony from witnesses. The report was reviewed and edited by the committee's members and staff, before being released to the public.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe final report summarized the committee's findings and conclusions,

He was a prominent figure in the world of classical music and a pioneer for racial equality in a society where people of African descent were often marginalized.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJean-Baptiste de Vilmorin, known as the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, was born in 1745 in Guadeloupe, a French colony in the Caribbean. His father, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, was a nobleman of African descent, and his mother, Marie-CÃ©cile de La Motte, was a French woman. This mixed ancestry would later become a significant aspect of his identity and career.\n\nSaint-Georges received his early musical training in Guadeloupe, and later moved to France with his family. He became a skilled violinist and began to develop his skills as a composer.\n\n**Musical life and career**\n\nSaint-Georges' musical career spanned several decades, during which he became one of the most prominent composers of his time. He was known for his virtuosic violin playing, and his compositions showcased his technical skill and musicality. Saint-Georges composed music in a variety of genres, including symphonies, concertos, and chamber music.\n\n**Operas**\n\nSaint-Georges wrote several operas, including \"Ernestine\" and \"Lesage\". These works showcased his ability to craft engaging and dramatic music for the stage.\n\n**Social life in Paris**\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, known for his elegance and refinement. He was a member of the aristocracy and enjoyed the benefits of his social status. However, his racial background made him the subject of prejudice and racism.\n\n### St. Georges assaulted\n\nIn 1765, Saint-Georges was assaulted by a group of racists who rejected his claims of nobility. Despite this incident, Saint-Georges continued to pursue his career and social status.\n\n**Two trips to London**\n\nSaint-Georges traveled to London twice, where he became friends with prominent figures such as George III. He was also recognized for his musical abilities and was praised by critics.\n\n### Second trip\n\nDuring his second trip, Saint-Georges premiered his opera \"Ernestine\", which was well-received by audiences. This success solidified his position as a leading figure in the musical world.\n\n**Lille**\n\nSaint-Georges also spent time in Lille, where he became acquainted with the local musical scene. He composed music for local performances and was recognized for his talents.\n\n**Military career**\n\nSaint-Georges served in the French military, where he rose to the rank of captain. He was known for his bravery and skill as a swordsman.\n\n**Possible Saint-Domingue visit**\n\nThere is some speculation that Saint-Georges may have visited Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), where he may have encountered the Haitian Revolution. However, this visit is not confirmed.\n\n**Death**\n\nSaint-Georges died in 1799, at the age of 54. He was remembered as a talented composer and a symbol of racial equality.\n\n**Home**\n\nSaint-Georges' home, a mansion in Paris, was a symbol of his success and status. It featured a grand piano and a collection of rare musical instruments.\n\n**Works**\n\nSaint-Georges' compositions include:\n\n### Operas\n\n* \"Ernestine\"\n* \"Lesage\"\n\n### Symphonies\n\n* Symphony in G major\n* Symphony in B-flat major\n\n### Concertante\n\n#### Violin concertos\n\n* Violin Concerto No. 1\n* Violin Concerto No. 2\n\n#### Symphonies concertantes\n\n* Symphony Concertante No. 1\n* Symphony Concertante No. 2\n\n### Chamber music\n\n#### Sonatas\n\n* Violin Sonata No. 1\n* Violin Sonata No. 2\n\n#### String quartet\n\n* String Quartet No. 1\n\n### Vocal music\n\n* \"Lesage\", an opera\n* \"Ernestine\", an opera\n\n### Dubious works\n\nSome of Saint-Georges' works are disputed due to the lack of conclusive evidence. These works include:\n\n* The Symphony in C major\n* The Violin Concerto in C major\n\n**Discography**\n\nSaint-Georges' music has been recorded by several artists, including:\n\n#### Symphonies concertantes\n\n* Symphony Concertante No. 1, performed by the Czech Philharmonic\n* Symphony Concertante No. 2, performed by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande\n\n#### Symphonies\n\n* Symphony in G major, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra\n* Symphony in B-flat major, performed by the Orchestre national de France\n\n#### Violin concertos\n\n* Violin Concerto No. 1, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\n* Violin Concerto No. 2, performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra\n\n#### Chamber music\n\n* Violin Sonata No. 1, performed by the YsaÃ¿e Quartet\n* Violin Sonata No. 2, performed by the Sekles Quartet\n* String Quartet No. 1, performed by the Alban Berg Quartet\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\n* \"Lesage\", an opera, performed by the OpÃ©ra de Paris\n* \"Ernestine\", an opera, performed by the Teatro alla Scala\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nSaint-Georges has been referenced in various forms of media, including:\n\n* Film: \"The Dumas\" (1969)\n* Television: \"The History of Jazz\" (1987)\n* Literature: \"The Chevalier de Saint-Georges\" by Wilfrid Blunt\n* Music: \"The Saint-Georges Variations\" by the composer Claude Debussy\n\n**Footnotes**\n\nNone\n\n**References**\n\n* Blunt, Wilfrid. \"The Chevalier de Saint-Georges\".
