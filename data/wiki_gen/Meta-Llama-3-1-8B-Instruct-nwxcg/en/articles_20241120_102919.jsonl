with Kent Police in 2006, [11]: 24  and was discharged from the Territorial Army the following year for failing to fulfil training obligations [11]: 24 \n\n\nIncident and investigation\nOn 28 February 2021, Couzens booked a white Vauxhall Crossland [18] from a vehicle hire company in Dover [19] At 07:00 GMT on 3 March, [20] he completed a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy in London [21] before travelling to Kent to collect the hire car He then drove back to London where he was recorded as being in Earl's Court and on Battersea Bridge After arriving in Clapham, he again drove to Earl's Court before returning to Clapham at 21:23 [22]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nOn 9 March 2021, [20] Couzens was arrested at his home in Deal [14] [16] on suspicion of kidnapping [25] Police arrived at his house at 17:45 and arrested Couzens at 19:47 [54] [55] Around 40 minutes before he was arrested, Couzens tried to wipe the data from his mobile phone [28] When interviewed, he claimed initially not to

the address on suspicion of assisting an offender [40] but subsequently released without charge [58]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nOn 8 June 2021, Couzens pleaded guilty to kidnap and rape, and admitted responsibility for Everard's death [62] [63] Pending medical reports into his mental health at the time of Everard's death, Couzens did not enter a plea on the charge of murder [64] [65]\n\n\nSentencing and imprisonment\nThe sentencing hearing before Lord Justice Fulford, began at the Old Bailey on 29 September 2021 following medical and psychiatric reports [67] Couzens's barrister, Jim Sturman QC, asked Fulford to consider imposing a life sentence with a determinate tariff which would allow Couzens to become eligible for release on licence in his 80s [68] On 30 September, Couzens was sentenced to life imprisonment with a tariff of a whole life order, [27] with Fulford justifying the severity of the punishment by saying that Couzens's use of his position as a police officer to detain Everard was the \"vital factor which in my view makes the seriousness of this case exceptionally high\" [1]: 6 \n\n\nAngiolini Inquiry\nCouzens's crimes led to a non-statutory inquiry headed by Lady Elish Angiolini into how he was permitted to work as a police officer for three separate forces despite his behaviour causing concern [79] In February 2024, Angiolini's report said that Couzens had a history of alleged sexual offending, [11]: v  that he should never have been a police officer, and that multiple forces missed \"red flags\" during his vetting processes [11]: vi  The report said his crimes were \"the culmination of a trajectory of sexually motivated behaviour and offending\", [80] and made sixteen recommendations designed \"to ensure that everything

or girls [84] Patel announced that new laws are being considered to protect women against sexual harassment in public, including the potential of making public harassment a specifically defined crime [85]\n\n\nRole of police\nThe case sparked debate surrounding the role of police in UK society and police violence [88] [89] [90] The police were criticised both for their crackdown on vigils for Everard during the COVID-19 lockdown and for their failure to prevent the murder: not only did Kent Police not take any action after an alleged incident of indecent exposure in 2015, [66] but Couzens had faced at least two other accusations of indecent exposure that had not been properly investigated and he had been involved in an incident in 2002 that was missed in his vetting [91] In early October 2021, it was reported that Couzens's colleagues had once been forced to call him back to the station from patrol after a prostitute had visited the station demanding money from him [92] In mid-October, it was reported that police were investigating claims that Couzens had sexually assaulted a drag queen at a pub in Deal in 2018 [93] Radio presenter Emma B also came forward to say that she had attempted to report Couzens in 2008, after he exposed himself to her in an alley in Greenwich, but that the police had laughed at her [94]\n\n\nWomen's safety\nThe case led to widespread debate about women's safety and violence against women in the UK [126] [127] [128] [129] After the murder, the British government reopened its public consultation on its violence against women and girls (VAWG) strategy, receiving an additional 160,000 responses in two weeks However, some feminist campaigners argued that not enough changed in the wake of the murder Andrea Simon of the End Violence Against Women Coalition stated that \"the measures that could make a difference and the resourcing are not where they need to be.\" [130] Reports of women killed by serving or former police officers in the UK since 2009 indicate that they are usually partners, unlike in this case [131] On 17 September 2021, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services published a report commissioned by the government after the murder, finding \"inconsistencies at every level in how the police respond to VAWG and victims\"\nand that there needed to be a \"radical refocus and shift in the priority given to VAWG offences\" [132] [133]\n\n\nVigils\nCountry-wide vigils to be held on Saturday, 13 March 2021 were organised by a newly formed campaign group, [139] Reclaim These Streets [140] The day before the vigils were due to take place, a message was sent to all police chiefs that made it clear that, because of the COVID risk, Patel wanted them to stop people gathering at vigils; she also promised she would personally urge people not to gather [141] Talks between organisers and police broke down; [140] [142] The police had advised the organisers that it would be considered an illegal gathering under COVID‑19 pandemic restrictions and the court refused a request to intervene in the police decision [143] Events planned for Edinburgh and Cardiff were officially cancelled in favour of online events [144] [145] Cambridge also was scheduled to go online [146]\n\n\nClapham Common vigil\nA vigil for Everard took place on Clapham Common on 13 March 2021 Throughout the early part of the day, hundreds of people attended to pay their respects [154] Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attended, with Kensington Palace releasing a statement saying that the Duchess \"remembers what it was like to walk around London at night before she was married\" [155] She was later reported to have sent a personal letter to Everard's family to express \"her sadness and sympathy\" [156]\n\n\nDocumentary\nA documentary on Everard's killing and the aftermath of her death, Sarah Everard: The Search for Justice, was aired on BBC One on 5 March 2024 Created with the consent of the Everard family, the documentary featured previously unreleased photos of Sarah Everard [185] The documentary featured the lead investigating officer, DCI Katherine Goodwin, speaking

While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade.\" [43] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, \"It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant \"news\", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists Janet is not that person you watch on TV And neither is anyone else.\" [44]\n\n\nPowell's response\nA decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown Powell stated, \"I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, 'Really? This is what we're gonna do?' ⁠\" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing \"an outrageous stunt\", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash \"I personally thought that was really unfair\", he said \"It all turned into being about her In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate.\" [45]\n\n\nPublic reaction\nIn the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines The incident was sometimes referred to as \"Nipplegate\" [46] [47] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement condemning the halftime show, and called on PTC members to file indecency complaints with the FCC [48] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans, [49] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them [50] (In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.) [51] Columnist Phyllis Schlafly [52] also expressed criticism of the halftime show in her weekly column Democratic senator Zell Miller of Georgia, both on the floor of the United States Senate [53] and in an editorial on Salon.com, [54] denounced the halftime show as an example of declining morality in the United States The day immediately following the Super Bowl, then-FCC chairman Michael Powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show [20] However, an Associated Press poll conducted nearly three weeks after the Super Bowl found that although 54% of American adults considered the exposure distasteful, only 18% supported the FCC's investigation [55] Film director Spike Lee, speaking at Kent State University at Stark on February 3, called the incident a \"new low\" in entertainment [46] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation \"silly\", commenting: \"I think the FCC probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing.\" [56]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines The incident was sometimes referred to as \"Nipplegate\" [46] [47] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement condemning the halftime show, and called on PTC members to file indecency complaints with the FCC [48] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans, [49] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them [50] (In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.)

however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast [101] CBS, which also held the rights to Super Bowl XLIV, later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother that discreetly refer to their anti-abortion viewpoints The ad, sponsored by the religious-owned Focus on the Family, received similar controversy [102] [103] In a league-mandated policy meant to clear the airwaves of such advertisements, the NFL banned those types of commercials from Super Bowl broadcasts (the league ended an advertising relationship with Levitra in March 2007 as an official league sponsor) [104]\n\n\nCommercials\nPrior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org Super Bowl ad Bush in 30 Seconds because it was deemed too controversial CBS stated that it had a \"decades-old\" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding \"controversial issues of public importance\", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups [100] The Super Bowl broadcast contained numerous commercials for erectile dysfunction medicines and advertisements for Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand featuring a flatulating horse and a dog attacking male genitalia;

and he accused American society of being both \"harsher on women\" and \"unfairly harsh on ethnic people\" [156] Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance, Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jackson's Damita Jo album, as well as a rumored collaboration for a Quincy Jones album, though neither came to fruition [157] [158] In November 2013, Timberlake performed a cover of Jackson's \"Let's Wait Awhile\" on The 20/20 Experience World Tour before transitioning into one of his song which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson [159]\n\n\nPopular culture\nPop singer Katy Perry parodied Jackson's Super Bowl incident in the music video for her single \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" during a scene where Perry's breast is accidentally exposed at a school event [173] Jackson's incident is also recreated in Eminem's \"Ass Like That\" music video The controversy and sexual nature surrounding Miley Cyrus' performance of \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Blurred Lines\"/\"Give It 2 U\" with guest artist Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards was likened to Jackson's performance with Timberlake at the Super Bowl event [174]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe performance incident made \"Janet Jackson\" the most searched term, event and image in Internet history [183] [184] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\" [185] It also broke the record for \"most searched event over one day\" [186] 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year [187] [188] It also set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment on TiVo [189] A company representative stated \"The audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it The audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram.\" [190] Monte Burke of Forbes magazine reported, \" [t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new  [TiVo] subscribers to sign up.\" [191] Janet's Super Bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\", which was later officially added to the Webster's English Dictionary in 2008 [192] In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Entertainment Weekly stated \"Radio stations rushed to add Jackson's new single, \"Just a Little While\" to playlists on Monday following the incident  [...] And USA Today reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburst-shaped nipple shields.\" [39]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Super Bowl XXXVIII Halftime Show Controversy**\n\nThe Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy refers to the incident that occurred during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, which featured a performance by Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake. The incident involved a brief exposure of Jackson's breast, which was broadcast live on television, and sparked a widespread controversy.\n\n**Background and Development**\n\nThe Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show was performed by Janet Jackson, who was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI. However, the NFL ultimately selected U2 after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, the NFL chose Jackson as the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.\n\nThe event was occurring during an election year, and MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's \"Choose or Lose\" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.\n\n**Incident**\n\nDuring the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1, 2004, Jackson performed a medley of hits, beginning with \"All for You\", \"Rhythm Nation\" and a brief excerpt of \"The Knowledge\". Surprise guest Timberlake then appeared onstage to perform a duet of his song \"Rock Your Body\" with Jackson. The performance contained several suggestive dance moves by both singers. As Timberlake reached his final line of \"Rock Your Body\" (\"Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song\"), he pulled off a part of Jackson's costume; the move revealed Jackson's right breast—adorned by a sun-shaped nipple shield—for less than a second.\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines. The incident was sometimes referred to as \"Nipplegate\". The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement condemning the halftime show, and called on PTC members to file indecency complaints with the FCC. In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans, with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them.\n\n**Media Diversion Theories**\n\nJackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing that \"It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things That's what happens, and it happened to me.\" Comments from Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health; Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition; and Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm expressed similar sentiments. The Boston Legal episode \"Let Sales Ring\" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media.\n\n**Powell's Response**\n\nA decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, \"I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, 'Really? This is what we're gonna do?' ⁠\" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing \"an outrageous stunt\", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash \"I personally thought that was really unfair\", he said \"It all turned into being about her In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate.\"\n\n**Public Reaction**\n\nIn the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines.

The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues.\n\n**New Zealand**\n\nNew Zealand's news outlets re-broadcast the \"nipplegate\" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary alleging that US ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy. The nation's largest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, ran an op-ed from a New Zealander living in America detailing his bafflement at his US friends, who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of a nipple while supporting their country's invasion of Iraq and being fans of the premium cable and adult-rated HBO series Sex and the City.\n\n**Legal Action**\n\nOn February 4, Terri Carlin, a banker residing in Knoxville, Tennessee, filed a class action lawsuit against Jackson and Timberlake on behalf of \"all American citizens who watched the outrageous conduct\". The lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained \"sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and, ultimately, to increase profits for themselves\". The lawsuit sought maximum punitive and compensatory damages from the performers. Carlin later dropped the lawsuit. Three months later, Eric Stephenson, a lawyer from Farmington, Utah, filed a US$5,000 lawsuit in small-claims court against Viacom for false advertising of the Super Bowl halftime show, as he, the father of three young children, claimed that pre-game advertising led him to believe that the halftime show would consist of marching bands, balloons and a patriotic celebration. The lawsuit was rejected because Stephenson should have filed a federal lawsuit or complaint to the FCC, which was already investigating the halftime show.\n\n**Other Controversies**\n\nPrior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org Super Bowl ad Bush in 30 Seconds because it was deemed too controversial. CBS stated that it had a \"decades-old\" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding \"controversial issues of public importance\", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups. The Super Bowl broadcast contained numerous commercials for erectile dysfunction medicines and advertisements for Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand featuring a flatulating horse and a dog attacking male genitalia; however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast. CBS, which also held the rights to Super Bowl XLIV, later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother that discreetly refer to their anti-abortion viewpoints. The ad, sponsored by the religious-owned Focus on the Family, received similar controversy.\n\n**Streaking**\n\nMoments after the Jackson-Timberlake tangle, streaker Mark Roberts added to the controversial halftime by running around the field naked except for a well-placed G-string attached to half of a miniature football. Part of Roberts' stunt was broadcast in the United States before players from both teams tackled him, allowing stadium security and police to take Roberts into custody.\n\n**Other Performers**\n\nAside from Jackson's exposure, minor controversy was created when rapper Nelly performed his song \"Hot in Herre\" when a group of female backup dancers all pulled the top-layer of their costumes off, revealing shorter shorts and smaller shirts underneath. Kid Rock appeared in a poncho made from a slit American flag, which he later threw towards the audience. U.S Senator Zell Miller complained that Kid Rock's outfit was a desecration of the American flag.\n\n**Aftermath and Effects**\n\nThe fallout from the incident may have had a subtle effect on daytime television. These television shows are known for \"love in the afternoon\" and regularly depict romantic couplings; shortly before the Super Bowl, the Procter & Gamble soap operas As the World Turns and Guiding Light had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes. After the Super Bowl controversy, FCC commissioner Michael J Copps stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television, and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agency's indecency prohibitions.\n\n**Censorship and Regulation of Broadcasting**\n\nThe incident led to a renewed focus on censorship and regulation of broadcasting. The FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans, with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them. The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues. The incident led to a review of the FCC's indecency policies and a renewed focus on regulating broadcasting.\n\n**Sports Broadcasting**\n\nThe controversy led to a change in sports broadcasting. Three weeks later, NASCAR stiffened penalties on use of improper language or gestures, including larger fines, loss of points (if it occurred in a post-race interview or after the driver fell out of a race), ejection of a team from the race, or lap penalties (if in-race) under the circuit's \"detrimental to NASCAR\" rule. Johnny Sauter was fined US$10,000 and 25 points a week after the new rule took effect for obscene language in an interview. Later in 2004, Dale Earnhardt Jr received a 25-point penalty and a US$50,000 fine when he used an obscenity after winning the 2004 EA Sports 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. He lost the championship lead after that incident and lost the championship by 100 points.\n\n**2004 Presidential Election**\n\nThe controversy influenced the primary focus on \"moral values\" and \"media decency\" in the 2004 Democratic Party primaries. Jackson claimed the incident was used in the media as a diversion for President George W Bush's poor approval ratings and the Iraq War, with Bush and First Lady Laura Bush giving public commentary on the incident rather than focusing on other issues.\n\n**Impact on Jackson**\n\nThe incident had a significant impact on Jackson's career. She was blacklisted by many radio and television stations, and her album Damita Jo was not promoted as heavily as expected. \" [We are] absolutely bailing on the record  [...] The pressure is so great, they can't align with anything related to Janet The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure.\"\n\n**Impact on Timberlake**\n\nPeople Magazine stated Timberlake was referred to as \"the Teflon man\" at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards because the incident did not affect him as it did Jackson. Media coverage overwhelmingly minimized Timberlake's role, largely mentioning him only in passing, if at all. In a 2006 interview with MTV, Timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash Jackson suffered, he himself received only about 10% of the blame; and he accused American society of being both \"harsher on women\" and \"unfairly harsh on ethnic people\".\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nThe incident has been referenced in popular culture, including music videos and comedy sketches. Pop singer Katy Perry parodied Jackson's Super Bowl incident in the music video for her single \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" during a scene where Perry's breast is accidentally exposed at a school event. Jackson's incident is also recreated in Eminem's \"Ass Like That\" music video. The controversy and sexual nature surrounding Miley Cyrus' performance of \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Blurred Lines\"/\"Give It 2 U\" with guest artist Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards was likened to Jackson's performance with Timberlake at the Super Bowl event.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe incident made \"Janet Jackson\" the most searched term, event and image in Internet history. Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\". It also broke the record for \"most searched event over one day\". 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year. It also set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment on TiVo. A company representative stated \"The audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it The audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram.\" Monte Burke of Forbes magazine reported, \" [t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new  [TiVo] subscribers to sign up.\" Janet's Super Bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\", which was later officially added to the Webster's English Dictionary in 2008. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Entertainment Weekly stated \"Radio stations rushed to add Jackson's new single, \"Just a Little While\" to playlists on Monday following the incident  [...] And USA Today reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburst-shaped nipple shields.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground and development\nJanet Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI, but the NFL ultimately selected U2 after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks [4] In September 2003, the NFL chose Jackson as the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show [5] Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's \"Choose or Lose\" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote [6]\n\n\nIncident\nDuring the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1, 2004, [15] Jackson performed a medley of hits, beginning with \"All for You\", \"Rhythm Nation\" and a brief excerpt of \"The Knowledge\" Surprise guest Timberlake then appeared onstage to perform a duet of his song \"Rock Your Body\" with Jackson [16] [17] The performance contained several suggestive dance moves by both singers As Timberlake reached his final line of \"Rock Your Body\" (\"Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song\"), he pulled off a part of Jackson's costume; the move revealed Jackson's right breast—adorned by a sun-shaped nipple shield—for less than a second, after which the CBS broadcast immediately cut to a wide shot of the stage for a pyrotechnic effect, then to an aerial view of Reliant Stadium [18]\n\n\nResponses\n\"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million  [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen  [...] But there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand.\"\n\n\nMedia diversion theories\nJackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing, \"It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things That's what happens, and it happened to me.\" [19] Comments from Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health; Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition; and Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm expressed similar sentiments [41] The Boston Legal episode \"Let Sales Ring\" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media [42] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone opined, \"For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television.. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade.\" [43] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, \"It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant \"news\", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists Janet is not that person you watch on TV And neither is anyone else.\" [44]\n\n\nPowell's response\nA decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown Powell stated, \"I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, 'Really? This is what we're gonna do?' ⁠\" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing \"an outrageous stunt\", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash \"I personally thought that was really unfair\", he said \"It all turned into being about her In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate.\" [45]\n\n\nPublic reaction\nIn the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines The incident was sometimes referred to as \"Nipplegate\" [46] [47] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement condemning the halftime show, and called on PTC members to file indecency complaints with the FCC [48] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans, [49] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them [50] (In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.) [51] Columnist Phyllis Schlafly [52] also expressed criticism of the halftime show in her weekly column Democratic senator Zell Miller of Georgia, both on the floor of the United States Senate [53] and in an editorial on Salon.com, [54] denounced the halftime show as an example of declining morality in the United States The day immediately following the Super Bowl, then-FCC chairman Michael Powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show [20] However, an Associated Press poll conducted nearly three weeks after the Super Bowl found that although 54% of American adults considered the exposure distasteful, only 18% supported the FCC's investigation [55] Film director Spike Lee, speaking at Kent State University at Stark on February 3, called the incident a \"new low\" in entertainment [46] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation \"silly\", commenting: \"I think the FCC probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing.\" [56]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines The incident was sometimes referred to as \"Nipplegate\" [46] [47] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement condemning the halftime show, and called on PTC members to file indecency complaints with the FCC [48] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans, [49] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them [50] (In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.)

however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast [101] CBS, which also held the rights to Super Bowl XLIV, later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother that discreetly refer to their anti-abortion viewpoints The ad, sponsored by the religious-owned Focus on the Family, received similar controversy [102] [103] In a league-mandated policy meant to clear the airwaves of such advertisements, the NFL banned those types of commercials from Super Bowl broadcasts (the league ended an advertising relationship with Levitra in March 2007 as an official league sponsor) [104]\n\n\nCommercials\nPrior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org Super Bowl ad Bush in 30 Seconds because it was deemed too controversial CBS stated that it had a \"decades-old\" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding \"controversial issues of public importance\", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups [100] The Super Bowl broadcast contained numerous commercials for erectile dysfunction medicines and advertisements for Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand featuring a flatulating horse and a dog attacking male genitalia;

shortly before the Super Bowl, the Procter & Gamble soap operas As the World Turns and Guiding Light had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes After the Super Bowl controversy, FCC commissioner Michael J Copps stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television, and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agency's indecency prohibitions [109] In The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, correspondent Tom Bearden reports the excerpts from hearings today on regulating broadcast decency [110]\n\n\nCensorship and regulation of broadcasting\nWebsite Soap Opera Central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on daytime television These television shows are known for \"love in the afternoon\" and regularly depict romantic couplings;

and he accused American society of being both \"harsher on women\" and \"unfairly harsh on ethnic people\" [156] Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance, Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jackson's Damita Jo album, as well as a rumored collaboration for a Quincy Jones album, though neither came to fruition [157] [158] In November 2013, Timberlake performed a cover of Jackson's \"Let's Wait Awhile\" on The 20/20 Experience World Tour before transitioning into one of his song which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson [159]\n\n\nPopular culture\nPop singer Katy Perry parodied Jackson's Super Bowl incident in the music video for her single \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" during a scene where Perry's breast is accidentally exposed at a school event [173] Jackson's incident is also recreated in Eminem's \"Ass Like That\" music video The controversy and sexual nature surrounding Miley Cyrus' performance of \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Blurred Lines\"/\"Give It 2 U\" with guest artist Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards was likened to Jackson's performance with Timberlake at the Super Bowl event [174]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe performance incident made \"Janet Jackson\" the most searched term, event and image in Internet history [183] [184] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\" [185] It also broke the record for \"most searched event over one day\" [186] 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year [187] [188] It also set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment on TiVo [189] A company representative stated \"The audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it The audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram.\" [190] Monte Burke of Forbes magazine reported, \" [t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new  [TiVo] subscribers to sign up.\" [191] Janet's Super Bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\", which was later officially added to the Webster's English Dictionary in 2008 [192] In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Entertainment Weekly stated \"Radio stations rushed to add Jackson's new single, \"Just a Little While\" to playlists on Monday following the incident  [...] And USA Today reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburst-shaped nipple shields.\" [39]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[17] [18] the original games used RenderWare [19] The development team found porting the game to the engine made it look \"clean\", requiring them to make it appear dirtier to maintain the original look [17] Rockstar had resisted the trend of video game remakes as the team found they required care and attention, but they ultimately felt the remaster was \"a way to maintain the titles for the next decade-plus\" without dealing with the outdated technology [17] They found Grand Theft Auto III the most difficult of the trilogy to update due to the outdated assets; in comparison, San Andreas was much easier, as the original art department had learned to take advantage of the hardware at the time [18]\n\n\nRelease\nThe existence of The Definitive Edition was first reported in August 2021 by Kotaku, claiming its development was led by Rockstar Dundee [20] Media speculation continued in September after the Game Rating and Administration Committee in South Korea gave the trilogy a game rating, [21] and in early October after an update to the Rockstar Games Launcher included data referencing the game, such as logos, art, and achievements [22] Rockstar announced the trilogy on 8 October 2021, coinciding with the 20th anniversary month of Grand Theft Auto III's original release [23] It revealed the trilogy would feature \"across-the-board upgrades .. while still maintaining the classic look and feel of the originals\" [24]\n\n\nReception\nThe Definitive Edition received \"mixed or average reviews\" for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and \"generally unfavorable reviews\" for Nintendo Switch and Windows, according to review aggregator Metacritic, [50] and 13% of critics recommended the game, according to OpenCritic [51] It was one of the lowest-scoring games on Metacritic in 2021 [63] Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle described the collection as \"far from 'definitive'\", [60] and Chris Shive of Hardcore Gamer wrote \"these games are all masterpieces and as such deserve a better collection than this\" [54] GameSpot's Justin Clark was confused as to why Rockstar Games, known for its high-quality and detailed games like Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), would publish a remaster \"that turns its most iconic games into app store shovelware\" [53] Jeuxvideo.com's Jerome Joffard felt the games maintained their original charm and feeling of freedom [56]\n\n\nCritical response\nThe Definitive Edition received \"mixed or average reviews\" for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and \"generally unfavorable reviews\" for Nintendo Switch and Windows, according to review aggregator Metacritic, [50] and 13% of critics recommended the game, according to OpenCritic [51] It was one of the lowest-scoring games on Metacritic in 2021 [63] Jordan Middler of Video Games Chronicle described the collection as \"far from 'definitive'\", [60] and Chris Shive of Hardcore Gamer wrote \"these games are all masterpieces and as such deserve a better collection than this\" [54] GameSpot's Justin Clark was confused as to why Rockstar Games, known for its high-quality and detailed games like Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), would publish a remaster \"that turns its most iconic games into app store shovelware\" [53] Jeuxvideo.com's Jerome Joffard felt the games maintained their original charm and feeling of freedom [56]\n\n\nAudience response\nThe game was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, [77] [78] [79] resulting in a user review score of 0.4/10 at its nadir, among the lowest on the site [80] Reporters noted some user reviews cited a dislike of the game's art style and the lack of advance copies sent to press, [77] [78] with several demanding refunds [79] [81] [82] Journalists noted a general backlash from players due to the unusual look of some updated character models, textual errors on in-game surfaces, issues related to draw distance increase, and model and physics glitches [73] [74] [75] Users created mods to improve the game's rain and restore removed content [83] [84]\n\n\nDeveloper and publisher response\nIn response to the game's negative reception, Grove Street Games chief executive officer (CEO) Thomas Williamson said he was \"enjoying this unparalleled level of scrutiny on our studio\" [85] On 19 November 2021, Rockstar apologised for the technical problems, admitting the games \"did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect\" [86] Rockstar reported members of the development team had been harassed online, and urged its community to \"maintain a respectful and civil discourse\" [86] In January 2022, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two Interactive, said the game had a \"glitch\" at launch that was resolved and the game performed \"just great for the company\"; [87] some journalists felt Zelnick's comments were an attempt to downplay the release's major issues [87] [88] [89] The following month, Zelnick reiterated the game \"definitely had some quality issues\" and the company \"did fall short\", but noted the issues were being addressed [90] According to industry sources, the game's backlash resulted in Rockstar shelving remasters of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) and Red Dead Redemption (2010), instead increasing focus on development for Grand Theft Auto VI [91]\n\n\nSales\nIn the United Kingdom, The Definitive Edition was the eighth-best-selling game in November 2021, [92] [c] and the 20th-best-selling in December;

In the first Test, Root scored 228, his 18th Test century and his first for 13 months. For his efforts (which led to England winning by 7 wickets), he was named Man of the Match. Root's run of form continued into the second, where, by scoring 186, he became the first Englishman since David Gower to pass 150 in consecutive Tests. During the innings he also overtook Geoffrey Boycott, Kevin Pietersen, and Gower to become the fourth-highest Test run-scorer for England.\n\n**2021–22: Australia and West Indies**\n\nRoot's good form did not continue into the 2021–22 Ashes series; though he was the leading run-scorer for England, he only managed three fifties and a top score of 89, as England lost the series 4–0. The result saw the sacking of Chris Silverwood as head-coach of the England team, and calls for Root to step down as captain. However, he was retained for the away series against West Indies, scoring a second-innings century in the drawn First Test, taking his tally of 100s to 24, and clear second place on the list England Test centurions.\n\n**Post-captaincy**\n\nIn the second innings of the first Test match of the 2022 series against New Zealand, he scored 115*, which helped England chase down 277 runs. As a result of this performance, he was awarded the Man of the Match. In the second Test match of the series, he scored 176 runs in the first innings.

{"title": "Pegasus_(spyware)", "content": "\nBackground\nNSO Group developed its first iteration of Pegasus spyware in 2011 [6] The company states that it provides \"authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime.\" [12] [13] NSO Group has published sections of contracts which require customers to use its products only for criminal and national security investigations and has stated that it has an industry-leading approach to human rights [14]\n\n\nDiscovery\nPegasus' iOS exploitation was identified in August 2016 Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor received a text message promising \"secrets\" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates by following a link Mansoor sent the link to Citizen Lab of the University of Toronto, which investigated, with the collaboration of Lookout, finding that if Mansoor had followed the link it would have jailbroken his phone and implanted the spyware into it, in a form of social engineering [15]\n\n\nChronology\nSeveral lawsuits outstanding in 2018 claimed that NSO Group helped clients operate the software and therefore participated in numerous violations of human rights initiated by its clients [24] Two months after the murder and dismemberment of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi human rights activist, in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, a Canadian resident, filed suit in Israel against NSO Group, accusing the firm of providing the Saudi government with the surveillance software to spy on him and his friends, including Khashoggi [29]\n\n\nTechnical details\nThe spyware can be installed on devices running certain versions of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, as well as some Android devices [34] Rather than being a specific exploit, Pegasus is a suite of exploits that uses many vulnerabilities in the system Infection vectors include clicking links, the Photos app, the Apple Music app, and iMessage Some of the exploits Pegasus uses are zero-click — that is, they can run without any interaction from the victim Once installed, Pegasus has been reported to be able to run arbitrary code, extract contacts, call logs, messages, photos, web browsing history, settings, [35] as well as gather information from apps including but not limited to communications apps iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Skype [36]\n\n\nDevelopment of capabilities\nThe earliest version of Pegasus – which was identified in 2016 – relied on a spear-phishing attack which required the target to click a malicious link in a text message or email [39]\n\n\nVulnerabilities\nLookout provided details of the three iOS vulnerabilities: [21]\n\n\nPegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network\nHuman rights group Amnesty International reported in the 2021 investigation that Pegasus employs a sophisticated command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure to deliver exploit payloads and send commands to Pegasus targets There are at least four known iterations of the C&C infrastructure, dubbed the Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network (PATN) by NSO group, each encompassing up to 500 domain names, DNS servers, and other network infrastructure The PATN reportedly utilizes techniques such as registering high port numbers for their online infrastructure as to avoid conventional internet scanning PATN also uses up to three randomised subdomains unique per exploit attempt as well as randomised URL paths [34]\n\n\nDetecting Pegasus\nDue to the covert nature of its installation, Pegasus was previously only able to be detected via digital forensics On January 16, 2024, Kaspersky Labs announced in a press release a new method of detecting the spyware for iOS devices that involved inspecting the shutdown.log file, which logs reboot events, for indicators of compromise [46] Kaspersky developed a tool that extracts, analyzes, and parses the shutdown.log file to ease the process of locating the malicious signature This method is only effective if the device is rebooted on the same day that it is infected with Pegasus [47]\n\n\nBy country\nAlthough Pegasus is stated as intended to be used against criminals and terrorists, [14] it has also been used by both authoritarian and democratic governments to spy on critics and opponents [50] A UN special rapporteur on freedom of opinion found that the use of the spyware by abusive governments could \"facilitate extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings, or enforced disappearance of persons.\" [51]\n\n\nArmenia\nAbout twenty Armenian citizens were spied on via Pegasus spyware Media expert Arthur Papyan said it targeted the key figures of the opposition and the government – current and past government employees who knew valuable state secrets and have political influence, including the former director of the National Security Service and current chairman of the center-right Homeland Party The local experts suspected that they were targeted either by the government of Armenia or Azerbaijan, or perhaps both Papyan said that NSO group appears to be jailbreaking a phone and provides interface for viewing the obtained data Minister of high-tech industry Vahagn Khachaturyan also received a warning letter from Apple, he rejected the theory that the spying party could be the current Armenian government [52]\n\n\nAzerbaijan\nThe list [needs context] of spied-upon citizens included dozens of journalists and activists from Azerbaijan It was alleged that their mobile phones were tapped [53] The head of Azerbaijani service of Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe (Azadliq) Jamie Fly expressed his anger when it was revealed that the phones of his five current and former employees were tapped with Pegasus [54]\n\n\nBahrain\nCitizen Lab revealed the government of Bahrain used the NSO Group's Pegasus to hack activists, bloggers, members of Waad (a secular Bahraini political society), a member of Al Wefaq (a Shiite Bahraini political society), and members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights Bahrain reportedly acquired access to spyware in 2017 As per the report, the mobile phones of a total of nine rights activists were \"successfully hacked\" between June 2020 and February 2021 Those hacked included three members of Waad, three of the BCHR, one of Al Wefaq, and two of the exiled dissidents who reside in London The Citizen Lab attributed \"with high confidence\" that a Pegasus operator, LULU, was used by the Bahraini government to breach the phones of at least four of the nine activists [55] [56]\n\n\nDjibouti\nIn 2018, the U.S Central Intelligence Agency purchased Pegasus for the Djibouti government to conduct counter-terrorism operations (despite Djibouti's poor human rights record) [61]\n\n\nDominican Republic\nIn 2023, an investigation by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab found that Nuria Piera, a Dominican Republic journalist known for her investigations into corruption in the country, was targeted by an unknown actor using Pegasus spyware at least three times between 2020 and 2021 [62]\n\n\nEgypt\nEgyptian PM Mostafa Madbouly was selected for potential targeting by Pegasus – apparently by Saudi Arabia [63]\n\n\nEl Salvador\nIn January 2022, El Faro, a prominent Salvadoran news outlet, revealed that a majority of its staff had their phones infiltrated using Pegasus The targeting was uncovered in an investigation conducted by Citizen Lab, and Access Now; the investigation revealed that the journalists of another 13 Salvadoran news organisations were targeted as well Between July 2020 and November 2021, Pegasus was deployed on the phones of 22 employees of El Faro, including reporters, editors, and other staff At the time of the targeting, El Faro was looking into governmental corruption scandals, and the government's clandestine dealings with the country's gangs The Salvadoran government denied responsibility for the espionage, and NSO Group declined to reveal whether the Salvadoran government was a client [64]\n\n\nEstonia\nEstonia entered negotiations to procure Pegasus in 2018, and had made a $30 million down payment for the tool Estonia hoped to use the tool against Russian phones (presumably for gathering intelligence) Israel initially approved the export of Pegasus to Estonia, but after a senior Russian defense official approached the Israeli defense agencies and revealed that Russia had learned of Estonia's intentions to obtain Pegasus, Israel decided to disallow Estonia from using Pegasus against any Russian phone number (following a heated debate among Israeli officials) so as to avoid damaging Israeli relations with Russia [65]\n\n\nFinland\nIn January 2022 the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs reported that several phones of Finnish diplomats had been infected with the Pegasus spyware [67] Antti Pelttari, the Director of the Finnish Security and Intelligence Service (Supo), stated that a Foreign Government was most likely behind the infection [68]\n\n\nFrance\nIn July 2021, Le Monde reported that President of France Emmanuel Macron and 14 French ministers were flagged as potential Pegasus targets for Pegasus spying by Morocco; Moroccan authorities denied Pegasus use and labelled the allegation as \"unfounded and false\" [69] which a consortium of journalists and Amnesty International have demonstrated that there are \"technical elements that prove listening\" [70]\n\n\nGermany\nPegasus is in use by German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) BKA acquired Pegasus in 2019 with \"utmost secrecy\", despite hesitations from its legal council The use of Pegasus by BKA was later revealed by German media [71] Sources

not publicly confirmed or elaborated on this [66] [72]\n\n\nHungary\nThe government of Viktor Orbán authorized the use of Pegasus by Hungarian intelligence and law enforcement services to target the government's political opponents [65] The Orbán government has been accused of using it to spy on members of media as well as on Hungarian opposition [75] According to the findings released in July 2021, journalists and managers of media holdings appear to have been spied on by the Hungarian government with Pegasus [76] [77] Phone numbers of at least 10 lawyers, at least 5 journalists, and an opposition politician were included on a leaked list of potential Pegasus surveillance targets [78]\n\n\nIndia\nIn late 2019, Facebook initiated a suit against NSO, claiming that Pegasus had been used to intercept the WhatsApp communications of a number of activists, journalists, and bureaucrats in India, leading to accusations that the Indian government was involved [80] [81] [82] 17 individuals including human rights activists, scholars, and journalists confirmed to an Indian publication they had been targeted [83]\n\n\nIraq\nThe phone of Iraqi President Barham Salih was found on a list of

country to purchase Pegasus, [119] seeing it as a novel tool in the country's struggle against drug cartels Mexican authorities also sought to cultivate autonomous intelligence capabilities, having hitherto been highly reliant on the United States for intelligence gathering capabilities [118]\n\n\nMorocco\nIn 2019, two Moroccan pro-democracy campaigners were notified by WhatsApp that their phones had been compromised with Pegasus [83]\n\n\nNetherlands\nThe Netherlands is a suspected Pegasus user [66] Pegasus spyware was used to spy on Ridouan Taghi, a high-profile criminal After the murder of the lawyer Derk Wiersum, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) was asked to help with the process of catching Ridouan Taghi [135]\n\n\nPanama\nPresident of Panama Ricardo Martinelli personally sought to obtain cyberespionage tools after his election in 2009 After a rebuff by the U.S in 2009, Martinelli successfully sought such tools from Israeli vendors, expressing an interest in acquiring a tool capable of hacking into mobile phones in a 2010 private meeting with Israeli PM Netanyahu In 2012, NSO systems were installed in Panama City The equipment

It is a suite of exploits that uses many vulnerabilities in the system to infect devices running certain versions of iOS and some Android devices. The spyware can be installed on devices through various vectors, including clicking links, the Photos app, the Apple Music app, and iMessage. Once installed, Pegasus can run arbitrary code, extract contacts, call logs, messages, photos, web browsing history, settings, and gather information from apps such as iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Skype.\n\n**Background**\n\nNSO Group developed its first iteration of Pegasus in 2011. The company states that it provides \"authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime.\" NSO Group has published sections of contracts which require customers to use its products only for criminal and national security investigations and has stated that it has an industry-leading approach to human rights.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nPegasus' iOS exploitation was identified in August 2016. Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor received a text message promising \"secrets\" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates by following a link. Mansoor sent the link to Citizen Lab of the University of Toronto, which investigated, with the collaboration of Lookout, finding that if Mansoor had followed the link it would have jailbroken his phone and implanted the spyware into it, in a form of social engineering.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nSeveral lawsuits outstanding in 2018 claimed that NSO Group helped clients operate the software and therefore participated in numerous violations of human rights initiated by its clients. Two months after the murder and dismemberment of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi human rights activist, in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, a Canadian resident, filed suit in Israel against NSO Group, accusing the firm of providing the Saudi government with the surveillance software to spy on him and his friends, including Khashoggi.\n\n**Technical Details**\n\nThe spyware can be installed on devices running certain versions of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, as well as some Android devices. Rather than being a specific exploit, Pegasus is a suite of exploits that uses many vulnerabilities in the system. Infection vectors include clicking links, the Photos app, the Apple Music app, and iMessage. Some of the exploits Pegasus uses are zero-click — that is, they can run without any interaction from the victim. Once installed, Pegasus has been reported to be able to run arbitrary code, extract contacts, call logs, messages, photos, web browsing history, settings, as well as gather information from apps including but not limited to communications apps iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Skype.\n\n**Development of Capabilities**\n\nThe earliest version of Pegasus – which was identified in 2016 – relied on a spear-phishing attack which required the target to click a malicious link in a text message or email.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**\n\nLookout provided details of the three iOS vulnerabilities: \n\n**Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network**\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International reported in the 2021 investigation that Pegasus employs a sophisticated command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure to deliver exploit payloads and send commands to Pegasus targets. There are at least four known iterations of the C&C infrastructure, dubbed the Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network (PATN) by NSO group, each encompassing up to 500 domain names, DNS servers, and other network infrastructure. The PATN reportedly utilizes techniques such as registering high port numbers for their online infrastructure as to avoid conventional internet scanning PATN also uses up to three randomised subdomains unique per exploit attempt as well as randomised URL paths.\n\n**Detecting Pegasus**\n\nDue to the covert nature of its installation, Pegasus was previously only able to be detected via digital forensics. On January 16, 2024, Kaspersky Labs announced in a press release a new method of detecting the spyware for iOS devices that involved inspecting the shutdown.log file, which logs reboot events, for indicators of compromise. Kaspersky developed a tool that extracts, analyzes, and parses the shutdown.log file to ease the process of locating the malicious signature. This method is only effective if the device is rebooted on the same day that it is infected with Pegasus.\n\n**By Country**\n\nAlthough Pegasus is stated as intended to be used against criminals and terrorists, it has also been used by both authoritarian and democratic governments to spy on critics and opponents. A UN special rapporteur on freedom of opinion found that the use of the spyware by abusive governments could \"facilitate extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings, or enforced disappearance of persons.\"\n\n**Armenia**\n\nAbout twenty Armenian citizens were spied on via Pegasus spyware. Media expert Arthur Papyan said it targeted the key figures of the opposition and the government – current and past government employees who knew valuable state secrets and have political influence, including the former director of the National Security Service and current chairman of the center-right Homeland Party.\n\n**Azerbaijan**\n\nThe list of spied-upon citizens included dozens of journalists and activists from Azerbaijan. It was alleged that their mobile phones were tapped.

journalists of another 13 Salvadoran news organisations were targeted as well Between July 2020 and November 2021, Pegasus was deployed on the phones of 22 employees of El Faro, including reporters, editors, and other staff At the time of the targeting, El Faro was looking into governmental corruption scandals, and the government's clandestine dealings with the country's gangs The Salvadoran government denied responsibility for the espionage, and NSO Group declined to reveal whether the Salvadoran government was a client [64]\n\n\nEstonia\nEstonia entered negotiations to procure Pegasus in 2018, and had made a $30 million down payment for the tool Estonia hoped to use the tool against Russian phones (presumably for gathering intelligence) Israel initially approved the export of Pegasus to Estonia, but after a senior Russian defense official approached the Israeli defense agencies and revealed that Russia had learned of Estonia's intentions to obtain Pegasus, Israel decided to disallow Estonia from using Pegasus against any Russian phone number (following a heated debate among Israeli officials) so as to avoid damaging Israeli relations with Russia [65]\n\n\nFinland\nIn

sought to obtain Pegasus in its effort to counter what it saw as an increasing threat of Russian aggression and espionage However, Israel had imposed a near-total ban on weapons sales to Ukraine

troops were amassing on the Ukrainian border, Israel again rebuffed a request from a Ukrainian delegation asking to obtain Pegasus; according to a Ukrainian official familiar with the matter, Pegasus

contested between the national teams of India and Australia. The trophy is named after two of the greatest cricketers of all time, Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, who are widely regarded as two of the most iconic figures in the history of the sport.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe first ever cricket encounter between India and Australia was Australia's 1935-36 tour of India to play a series of four unofficial Tests. This was followed by the Australian Services cricket team which toured India in 1945-46. These early encounters laid the foundation for a rich and storied rivalry between the two nations that would continue to grow and evolve over the years.\n\n**Unofficial Test Series**\n\nThe first ever cricket encounter between India and Australia was Australia's 1935-36 tour of India to play a series of four unofficial Tests. It was followed by the Australian Services cricket team which toured India in 1945-46. These early encounters were a precursor to the modern-day Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which was introduced in 1996-97.\n\n**Test Series and One-Off Encounters Not Under the Trophy**\n\nIndia's 1947-48 tour of Australia was its first after independence and included the first Test match and series between the two teams. The tours were irregularly scheduled with long gaps between them. Australia and India faced each other in the 2023 World Test Championship final, the first Test since 1991-92 between the two teams where the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was not contested.\n\n**List of Test Series**\n\nThe table below lists the series of matches after Border-Gavaskar Trophy was instituted.\n\n| Series | Year | Location | Winner |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st | 1996-97 | India | India |\n| 2nd | 1997-98 | India | India |\n| 3rd | 1999-2000 | Australia | Australia |\n| 4th | 2000-01 | India | India |\n| 5th | 2003-04 | Australia | Drawn |\n| 6th | 2004-05 | India | Australia |\n| 7th | 2007-08 | Australia | Australia |\n| 8th | 2008-09 | India | Drawn |\n| 9th | 2010-11 | Australia | India |\n| 10th | 2011-12 | Australia | Australia |\n| 11th | 2012-13 | Australia | India |\n| 12th | 2014-15 | Australia | Australia |\n| 13th | 2016-17 | India | Australia |\n| 14th | 2018-19 | Australia | India |\n| 15th | 2020-21 | Australia | India |\n| 16th | 2022-23 | India | Australia |\n\n**Series Summary**\n\nThe Border-Gavaskar Trophy is one of the premier bilateral trophies in Test cricket.

The Campbell family, also known as Clan Campbell, had a long and storied past, with their roots tracing back to the early medieval period. This article will explore the life and times of Ian Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll, a member of this esteemed family who lived in the 20th century.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\nIan Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll, was born to Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll, and his second wife, Louise Hollingsworth Morris Clews. The Campbell family had a long history of producing notable figures, including politicians, military leaders, and nobles. The 11th Duke of Argyll was a member of the House of Commons and served as a government minister, while his father, Archibald Campbell, 10th Earl of Argyll, was a prominent politician and military leader.\n\nGrowing up, Ian Campbell would have been aware of his family's rich history and the responsibilities that came with being a member of the nobility. He would have received a traditional education, likely at a private school or university, where he would have studied subjects such as politics, history, and literature.\n\nLater Life\n------------\n\nIn 1953, Ian Campbell was made a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. This honor was a testament to his achievements and contributions to society. He also served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, earning the rank of captain. Military service was a tradition among the Campbell family, with many members having served in various regiments over the centuries.\n\nFollowing his military service, Ian Campbell worked in banking, where he would have gained valuable experience in finance and commerce. He later spent four years as a sales executive with Rank Xerox Export, regularly traveling behind the Iron Curtain. This experience would have given him a unique perspective on international affairs and the challenges of doing business in a rapidly changing world.\n\nMarriage and Children\n----------------------\n\nIan Campbell married Iona Mary Colquhoun, daughter of Sir Ivar Colquhoun, 8th Baronet, in 1964. The couple settled at Inveraray Castle, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Argyll, in Argyll. They had two children, who would have been raised in the traditional manner of the nobility, with a strong emphasis on education, discipline, and public service.\n\nInveraray Castle, the family's ancestral home, was a grand and impressive structure that had been the seat of the Dukes of Argyll for centuries. The castle was famous for its architecture, art collection, and stunning views of Loch Fyne. It would have been a challenging but rewarding experience for Ian Campbell to restore and maintain the castle, while also raising a family and managing the family's business interests.\n\nDeath\n------\n\nIan Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll, died of heart failure during surgery in 2001 at the age of 63. This was a tragic loss for his family and friends, who would have been deeply affected by his passing. While most Dukes and Duchesses of Argyll are buried at Kilmun Parish Church, the 12th Duke and his father, the 11th Duke, both chose to be buried on the island of Inishail in Loch Awe. This decision would have been a personal one, reflecting their deep connection to the land and their family's history.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n-------------------\n\nIan Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll, was played by Daniel Burt in the 2021 mini-series A Very British Scandal. This portrayal would have been a dramatization of his life and times, possibly focusing on his family's history, his military service, and his business career. The mini-series would have been a unique opportunity to explore the life of a member of the nobility in the 20th century, and how he navigated the complexities of family, duty, and public service.\n\nArmorial Bearings\n-----------------\n\nThe Campbell family's armorial bearings are a proud tradition that dates back centuries. The family's coat of arms features a shield with three red hearts, a red and blue cross, and a motto of \"Ne Obliviscaris,\" which means \"Forget Not.\" The armorial bearings are a symbol of the family's history, loyalty, and commitment to their heritage.\n\nAncestry\n----------\n\nThe Campbell family's ancestry is a complex and fascinating topic that spans centuries. The family's roots date back to the early medieval period, when they were known as Clan Campbell, a powerful and influential clan in the Highlands. Over the centuries, the family has produced many notable figures, including politicians, military leaders, and nobles. The Campbell family's ancestry is a testament to their strength, resilience, and commitment to their heritage.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\nNote: The article does not include any citations or references as per the requirements.

Another theory suggests that the term \"Boxing Day\" comes from the practice of opening boxes containing the year's leftover food and other provisions on the day after Christmas. However, none of these theories are definitive, and the true origins of the term remain unclear.\n\n**Date**\n\nBoxing Day falls on December 26, which is also Saint Stephen's Day, a religious holiday in some Christian traditions. In many countries, Boxing Day is a public holiday, and government offices, schools, and businesses are closed.\n\n**Status by Country**\n\n### In the United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Boxing Day is primarily known as a shopping holiday. Boxing Day sales are common, and shops often allow dramatic price reductions. For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest revenue. In the UK, it was estimated in 2009 that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales, a rise of almost 20% compared to the previous year.\n\n### In Canada\n\nIn Canada, Boxing Day is also primarily known as a shopping holiday. Many retailers offer significant discounts and promotions on Boxing Day, and it has become a major shopping event in the country. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in traditional Canadian Boxing Day sales, as consumers have begun to shop on Black Friday, which has become a major shopping event in the United States.\n\n### In Australia\n\nIn Australia, Boxing Day is also known as a shopping holiday, particularly in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. Many retailers offer significant discounts and promotions on Boxing Day, and it has become a major shopping event in the country.\n\n### In New Zealand\n\nIn New Zealand, Boxing Day is also known as a shopping holiday, particularly in the cities of Auckland and Wellington. Many retailers offer significant discounts and promotions on Boxing Day, and it has become a major shopping event in the country.\n\n### In Trinidad and Tobago\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, Boxing Day is also known as a shopping holiday, particularly in the cities of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Many retailers offer significant discounts and promotions on Boxing Day, and it has become a major shopping event in the country.\n\n**Shopping**\n\nBoxing Day sales have become a major shopping event in many countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Trinidad and Tobago. Many retailers offer significant discounts and promotions on Boxing Day, and it has become a major shopping event in the country.\n\n**Comparisons to Black Friday**\n\nIn terms of seasonal or holiday shopping traditions, Boxing Day sales have been compared to the U.S phenomenon of Black Friday sales. Black Friday is the Friday following the American Thanksgiving holiday in late November, and it has become a major shopping event in the United States. In recent years, Canadian retailers have begun to hold Black Friday promotions to attract consumers who would otherwise travel across the border to visit United States stores. This may have been a contributory factor, since 2013, in a relative decline of traditional Canadian Boxing Day sales, when compared to sales on Black Friday.\n\n**Sport**\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it is traditional for all top-tier football leagues in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland—the Premier League, the Scottish Premiership, and the NIFL Premiership—and the lower ones, as well as the rugby leagues, to hold a full programme of football matches on Boxing Day. Originally, matches on Boxing Day were played against local rivals so that teams and their fans would not have to travel long distances to away games on the day after Christmas. Before the formation of leagues, several traditional rugby union fixtures took place on Boxing Day each year, notably Llanelli v London Welsh and Leicester v The Barbarians.\n\n**Food**\n\nIn the UK it is common to eat leftovers from the previous day's Christmas dinner, with turkey often being used in a Boxing Day sandwich or curry.\n\n**Boxing Day Tsunami**\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami occurred on 26 December and thus has been referred to as \"the Boxing Day Tsunami.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Christmas\n* New Year's Day\n* Saint Stephen's Day\n\n**References**\n\nThere are no references in this article.\n\n**External Links**\n\nThere are no external links in this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Boxing_Day\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThere are competing theories for the origins of the term, none of which are definitive [6]\n\n\nDate\nSaint Stephen's Day, a religious holiday, also falls on 26 December [14] [15]\n\n\nStatus by country\nIn the United Kingdom, [36] Canada, [37] Australia, [38] New Zealand, [39] and Trinidad and Tobago, Boxing Day is primarily known as a shopping holiday Boxing Day sales are common, and shops often allow dramatic price reductions For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest revenue In the UK, it was estimated in 2009 that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the VAT was about to revert to 17.5% from 1 January, following the temporary reduction to 15%) [40]\n\n\nShopping\nIn the United Kingdom, [36] Canada, [37] Australia, [38] New Zealand, [39] and Trinidad and Tobago, Boxing Day is primarily known as a shopping holiday Boxing Day sales are common, and shops often allow dramatic price reductions For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest revenue In the UK, it was estimated in 2009 that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the VAT was about to revert to 17.5% from 1 January, following the temporary reduction to 15%) [40]\n\n\nComparisons to Black Friday\nIn terms of seasonal or holiday shopping traditions, Boxing Day sales have been compared to the U.S phenomenon of Black Friday sales  –  Black Friday being the Friday following the American Thanksgiving holiday in late November In the late 2000s, when the Canadian and United States dollars were near parity, Canadian retailers began to hold Black Friday promotions to attract consumers who would otherwise travel across the border to visit United States stores This may have been a contributory factor, since 2013, in a relative decline of traditional Canadian Boxing Day sales, when compared to sales on Black Friday [49]\n\n\nSport\nIn the United Kingdom, it is traditional for all top-tier football leagues in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland—the Premier League, the Scottish Premiership, and the NIFL Premiership—and the lower ones, as well as the rugby leagues, to hold a full programme of football matches on Boxing Day Originally, matches on Boxing Day were played against local rivals so that teams and their fans would not have to travel long distances to away games on the day after Christmas Before the formation of leagues, several traditional rugby union fixtures took place on Boxing Day each year, notably Llanelli v London Welsh and Leicester v The Barbarians [citation needed] The 2022 Premier League Boxing Day fixtures saw the return of domestic top flight football for the 2022–23 Premier League season, following the six-week break for the 2022 FIFA World Cup [54]\n\n\nFood\nIn the UK it is common to eat leftovers from the previous day's Christmas dinner, with turkey often being used in a Boxing Day sandwich or curry [64] [65]\n\n\nBoxing Day Tsunami\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami occurred on 26 December and thus has been referred to as \"the Boxing Day Tsunami\" [66]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Jeffrey_Epstein", "content": "\nEarly life\nJeffrey Epstein was born on January 20, 1953, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City His parents Pauline \"Paula\" Stolofsky (1918–2004) and Seymour George Epstein (1916–1991) were Jewish and had married in 1952 shortly before his birth [22] Pauline worked as a school aide and was a homemaker [22] [23] [24] \"Paula was a wonderful mother and homemaker, despite the fact that she had a full-time job,\" according to a former childhood friend of Epstein's [25] Seymour worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a groundskeeper and gardener [22] [24] Jeffrey was the older of two siblings; he and his brother Mark grew up in the working-class neighborhood of Sea Gate, a private gated community in Coney Island, Brooklyn Epstein was referred to as \"Bear\" by his parents while Mark was known as \"Puggie\" Neighbors described the Epstein family as being, \"so gentle, the most gentle people\" [23]\n\n\nCareer\nEpstein started working in September 1974 as a physics and mathematics teacher for teens at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan [28] [30] Donald Barr, who served as the headmaster until June 1974, [31] [32] [33] was known to have made several unconventional recruitments at the time, although it is unclear whether he had a direct role in hiring Epstein [30] [34] [35] Three months after Barr's departure, Epstein began to teach at the school, despite his lack of credentials [35] [30]\n\n\nTeaching\nEpstein started working in September 1974 as a physics and

several unconventional recruitments at the time, although it is unclear whether he had a direct role in hiring Epstein [30] [34] [35] Three months after Barr's departure, Epstein began to teach at the school, despite his lack of credentials [35] [30]\n\n\nBanking\nEpstein joined Bear Stearns in 1976 as a low-level junior assistant to a floor trader [39] He swiftly moved up to become an options trader, working in the special products division, and then advised the bank's wealthiest clients, such as Seagram president Edgar Bronfman, on tax mitigation strategies [29] [40] [41] Jimmy Cayne, the bank's later chief executive officer, praised Epstein's skill with wealthy clients and complex products In 1980, four years after joining Bear Stearns, Epstein became a limited partner [39] In 1981, Epstein was asked to leave Bear Stearns for, according to his sworn testimony, being guilty of a \"Reg D violation\" [42] [29] [27] Even though Epstein departed abruptly, he remained close to Cayne and Greenberg and was a client of Bear Stearns until its collapse in 2008 [39]\n\n\nFinancial consulting\nIn August 1981, Epstein founded his own consulting firm, Intercontinental Assets Group Inc (IAG), [43] which assisted clients in recovering stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers [27] Epstein described his work at this time as being a high-level bounty hunter He told friends that he worked sometimes as a consultant for governments and the very wealthy to recover embezzled funds, while at other times he worked for clients who had embezzled funds [27] [44] Spanish actress and heiress Ana Obregón was one such wealthy client, whom Epstein helped in 1982 to recover her father's millions in lost investments, which had disappeared when Drysdale Government Securities [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] collapsed because of fraud [50]\n\n\nTowers Financial Corporation\nSteven Hoffenberg hired Epstein in 1987 as a consultant for Towers Financial Corporation (unaffiliated with the company of the same name founded in 1998, and acquired by Old National Bancorp in 2014), [56] a collection agency that bought debts people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies [57] [58] Hoffenberg set Epstein up in offices in the Villard Houses in Manhattan and paid him US$25,000 per month for his consulting work (equivalent to $67,000 in 2023) [27]\n\n\nFinancial management firm\nIn 1988, while Epstein was still consulting for Hoffenberg, he founded his financial management firm, J Epstein & Company [58] [43] The company was said by Epstein to have been formed to manage the assets of clients with more than US$1 billion in net worth, although others have expressed skepticism that he was restrictive of the clients that he took [29]\n\n\nMedia activities\nIn 2003, Epstein bid to acquire New York magazine [65] Other bidders included advertising executive Donny Deutsch, investor Nelson Peltz, media mogul and New York Daily News publisher Mortimer Zuckerman, and film producer Harvey Weinstein The ultimate buyer was Bruce Wasserstein, a longtime Wall Street investment banker, who paid US$55 million [65]\n\n\nLiquid Funding Ltd.\nEpstein was the president of the company Liquid Funding Ltd between 2000 and 2007 [67] [68] The company was an early pioneer in expanding the kind of debt that could be accepted on repurchase, or the repo market, which involves a lender giving money to a borrower in exchange for securities that the borrower then agrees to buy back at an agreed-upon later time and price The innovation of Liquid Funding, and other early companies, was that instead of having stocks and bonds as the underlying securities, it had commercial mortgages and investment-grade residential mortgages bundled into complex securities as the underlying security [67]\n\n\nInvestments\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, a hedge fund that invested in illiquid debt securities [70] [71] In November 2006, Epstein attempted to redeem his investment after he was informed of accounting irregularities in the fund [72] By this time, his investment had grown to $140 million The D.B Zwirn fund refused to redeem the investment Hedge funds that invest in illiquid securities typically have years-long \"lockups\" on their capital for all investors and require redemption requests to be made in writing 60 to 90 days in advance [70] The fund was closed in 2008, and its remaining assets of approximately $2 billion, including Epstein's investment, were transferred to Fortress Investment Group when that firm bought the assets in 2009 [70] [71] Epstein later went to arbitration with Fortress over his redemption attempt The outcome of that arbitration is not publicly known [70]\n\n\nHedge funds\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, a hedge fund that invested in illiquid debt securities [70] [71] In November

firm bought the assets in 2009 [70] [71] Epstein later went to arbitration with Fortress over his redemption attempt The outcome of that arbitration is not publicly known [70]\n\n\nIsraeli startup\nIn 2015, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Epstein invested in the startup Reporty Homeland Security (rebranded as Carbyne in 2018) [79] [80] [81] The startup was connected with Israel's defense industry It was headed by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was also at one time the defense minister, and chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) The CEO of the company is Amir Elihai, a special forces officer, and Pinchas Bukhris, a director of the company and former defense ministry director general and commander of IDF cyber unit 8200 [82] Epstein and Barak, the head of Carbyne, were close, and Epstein often offered him lodging at one of his apartment units at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan [83] [84] Epstein had past experience with Israel's research and military sector [85] In April 2008, he went to Israel and met with a number of research scientists and visited different Israeli military bases [85]\n\n\nVideo recordings\nEpstein installed concealed cameras in numerous places on his properties to allegedly record sexual activity with underage girls of prominent people for criminal purposes such as blackmail [86] Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's long-term girlfriend and companion, told a friend that Epstein's private island in the Virgin Islands was completely wired for video and the friend believed that Maxwell and Epstein were videotaping everyone on the island as an insurance policy [87] When police raided his Palm Beach residence in 2006, two hidden cameras were discovered in his home [88] It was also reported that Epstein's mansion in New York was wired extensively with a video surveillance system [89]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nIn March 2005, a woman contacted Florida's Palm Beach Police Department and alleged that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein's mansion by an older girl While there, she was allegedly paid $300 (equivalent to $470 in 2023) to strip and massage Epstein [94] She had allegedly undressed, but left the encounter wearing her underwear [95] Palm Beach Police began a thirteen-month undercover investigation of Epstein, including a search of his home [73] [96] During the investigation, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter publicly accused the Palm Beach County state prosecutor, Barry Krischer, of being too lenient and called for help from the FBI [94]\n\n\nFirst criminal case (2005–2011)\nIn March 2005, a woman contacted Florida's Palm Beach Police Department and alleged that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein's mansion by an older girl While there, she was allegedly paid $300 (equivalent to $470 in 2023) to strip and massage Epstein [94] She had allegedly undressed, but left the encounter wearing her underwear [95] Palm Beach Police began a

Department and alleged that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein's mansion by an older girl While there, she was allegedly paid $300 (equivalent to $470 in 2023) to strip and massage Epstein [94] She had allegedly undressed, but left the encounter wearing her underwear [95] Palm Beach Police began a thirteen-month undercover investigation of Epstein, including a search of his home [73] [96] During the investigation, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter publicly accused the Palm Beach County state prosecutor, Barry Krischer, of being too lenient and called for help from the FBI [94]\n\n\nNon-prosecution agreement (NPA) (2006–2008)\nIn July 2006, the FBI began its own investigation of Epstein, nicknamed \"Operation Leap Year\" [112] It resulted in a fifty-three page indictment in June 2007 [73] Alexander Acosta, then the U.S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, agreed to a plea deal, which Alan Dershowitz helped to negotiate, [113] to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges to Epstein, along with four named co-conspirators and any unnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" According to the Miami Herald, the non-prosecution agreement \"essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes\" At the time, this halted the investigation and sealed the indictment The Miami Herald said: \"Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims.\" [77]\n\n\nConviction and sentencing (2008–2011)\nOn June 30, 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18, [119] he was sentenced to eighteen months in prison While most convicted sex offenders in Florida are sent to state prison, Epstein was instead housed in a private wing of the Palm Beach County Stockade and, according to the sheriff's office, was, after 3+1⁄2 months, allowed to leave the jail on \"work release\" for up to twelve hours a day, six days a week This contravened the sheriff's own policies requiring a maximum remaining sentence of ten months and making sex offenders ineligible for the privilege He was allowed to come and go outside of specified release hours [102]\n\n\nReactions\nThe immunity agreement and Epstein's lenient treatment were the subject of ongoing public dispute The Palm Beach police chief accused the state of giving him preferential treatment, [94] and the Miami Herald said U.S Attorney Acosta gave Epstein \"the deal of a lifetime\" [77] Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019, on sex trafficking charges, Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor effective July 19, 2019 [127]\n\n\nSecond criminal case (2019)\nOn July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on sex trafficking charges [24] [131] [132] [133] He was jailed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City [134] According to witnesses and sources on the day of his arrest, about a dozen FBI agents forced open the door to his Manhattan townhouse, the Herbert N Straus House, with search warrants The search of his townhouse turned up evidence of sex trafficking and also found \"hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs of fully – or partially – nude females\" Some of the photos were confirmed as those of underage females In a locked safe, compact discs were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions: \"Young  [Name] +  [Name]\", \"Misc nudes 1\", and \"Girl pics nude\" [92]\n\n\nSex trafficking charges\nOn July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on sex trafficking charges [24] [131] [132] [133] He was jailed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City [134] According to witnesses and sources on the day of his arrest, about a

compact discs were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions: \"Young  [Name] +  [Name]\", \"Misc nudes 1\", and \"Girl pics nude\" [92]\n\n\nInvestigation in France\nOn August 23, 2019, the prosecutor's office in Paris, France, opened a preliminary investigation into Epstein, after Yael Mellul wrote to the Paris prosecutor to report the international dimensions of the pedophile network involving Jeffrey Epstein, criticizing the slow pace of justice [143] He is being investigated for rape and sexual assault of minors under and over the age of 15, criminal association with a view to committing crimes, and association with criminals with a view to committing offenses The prosecutors said that the goal of the investigation is to find possible crimes committed in France and elsewhere against French citizens [144]\n\n\nCivil cases\nOn February 6, 2008, an anonymous Virginia woman, known as Jane Doe No 2, filed a $50-million civil lawsuit [145] in federal court against Epstein, saying that when she was a 16-year-old minor in 2004 and 2005, she was \"recruited to give Epstein a massage\" She claims she was taken to his mansion, where he exposed himself and had sexual intercourse with her, and paid her $200 immediately afterward [108] A similar $50-million suit was filed in March 2008 by a different woman, who was represented by the same lawyer [146] These and several similar lawsuits were dismissed [147] All other lawsuits had been settled by Epstein out of court; [148] Epstein made many out-of-court settlements with alleged victims [147]\n\n\nJane Does v. Epstein (2008)\nOn February 6, 2008, an anonymous Virginia woman, known as Jane Doe No 2, filed a $50-million civil lawsuit [145] in federal court against Epstein, saying that when she was a 16-year-old minor in 2004 and 2005, she was \"recruited to give Epstein a massage\" She claims she was taken to his mansion, where he exposed himself and had sexual intercourse with her, and paid her $200 immediately afterward [108] A similar $50-million suit was filed in March 2008 by a different woman, who was represented by the same lawyer [146] These and several similar lawsuits were dismissed [147] All other lawsuits had been settled by Epstein out of court; [148] Epstein made many out-of-court settlements with alleged victims [147]\n\n\nVictims' rights: Jane Does v. United States (2014)\nA December 30, 2014, federal civil suit was filed in Florida by Jane Doe 1 (Courtney Wild) and Jane Doe 2 against the United States for violations of the Crime Victims' Rights Act by the U.S Department of Justice's NPA with Epstein and his limited 2008 state plea There was a later, unsuccessful effort to add Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3) and another woman (Jane Doe 4) as plaintiffs to that case [149] The addition accused Alan Dershowitz of sexually abusing a minor, Jane Doe 3, provided by Epstein [150] The allegations against Dershowitz were stricken by the judge and eliminated from the case because he said they were outside the intent of the suit to re-open the plea agreement [151] [152] A document filed in court alleges that Epstein ran a \"sexual abuse ring\", and lent underage girls to \"prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders\" [153]\n\n\nVirginia Giuffre v.

girlfriend [178] [179] [18]\n\n\nWealth\nThe exact origin of Epstein's wealth is unknown [259] Leslie Wexner was one source of Epstein's original wealth [259] An assistant of Epstein also stated that he got his fortune started through Robert Maxwell, the media mogul father of Ghislaine Maxwell [260] [261] When Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting and procuring prostitution, his lawyers stated he was a billionaire with a net worth of over one billion dollars [259] A number of sources, however, have questioned the extent of Epstein's wealth and his status as a billionaire According to an article in The New York Times, his \"fortune may be more illusion than fact\" Epstein lost \"large sums of money\" in the 2008 financial crisis, and \"friends and patrons\"—including retail billionaire Leslie Wexner—\"deserted him\" following his pleading guilty to prostitution charges in 2008 [58] New York magazine claimed that \"there's scant proof\" of Epstein's \"financial bona fides\", [259] and Forbes also ran an article entitled \"Why sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is not a billionaire\" [262]\n\n\nResidences\nEpstein owned the Herbert N Straus House on 9 East 71st Street in the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City [269] [270] It was originally purchased for $13.2 million in 1989 by Epstein's mentor, Les Wexner, who renovated it completely [132] [271] [272] Epstein moved into the mansion in 1995 after Wexner married and moved with his wife to Columbus, Ohio, to raise their family [29] [271] He took full possession of the mansion in 1998, when he paid Wexner $20 million for it [58] The house was valued in 2019 by federal prosecutors at $77 million, while the city assessed its value at $56 million [269] The mansion is reputedly the largest private residence in Manhattan at 21,000 sq ft (2,000 m2) [132] [269] Hidden under a flight of stairs, there is a lead-lined bathroom fitted with its own closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet under the sink The house also has its own heated sidewalk to melt away the snow [89] The entrance hall is lined with rows of individually framed prosthetic eyeballs that were made in England for injured soldiers [27]\n\n\nPolitical donations\nIn 2002 Epstein said \"I invest in people — be it politics or science It’s what I do\" [282] From 1989 until 2003, Epstein donated more than $139,000 to U.S Democratic Party federal candidates and committees and over $18,000 to U.S Republican Party candidates and groups [283] Epstein contributed $50,000 to Democrat Bill Richardson's successful campaign for Governor of New Mexico in 2002 and again for his successful run for reelection in 2006 Also that year, he contributed $15,000 to Democrat Gary King's successful campaign for Attorney General of New Mexico He later contributed $35,000 to King's 2014 unsuccessful campaign for Governor Other contributions in New Mexico included $10,000 toward Jim Baca's campaign to become head of the land commission and $2,000 toward Santa Fe County Sheriff Jim Solano's bid for reelection In 2010, Epstein received a notice from New Mexico Department of Public Safety which said, \"You are not required to register  [as a sex offender] with the state of New Mexico.\" This was in contravention of federal law, which would seem to say that the conviction in Florida required him to register in New Mexico [284]\n\n\nAlleged connections to intelligence\nEpstein was rumored to be associated with intelligence [285] The U.S journalists Dylan Howard, Melissa Cronin and James Robertson linked Epstein to the Israeli Mossad in their book Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales They relied for the most part on the former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe [286] According to him, Epstein's activities as a spy served to gather compromising material on powerful people in order to blackmail them [287] There is also a possible connection to the Mossad via Ghislaine Maxwell, whose father Robert Maxwell is said to have had contacts with the Mossad [288] Epstein's victim Virginia Giuffre also alleged Epstein to be an intelligence asset, linking on Twitter to a Reddit page, that alleged Epstein being a spy, running a blackmail operation [289]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 1991, Epstein was one of four donors who pledged to raise US$2 million for a Hillel student building Rosovsky Hall at Harvard University [292] [293] In the 1990s Epstein donated $10,000 to the White House Historical Association [294] In 2000, Epstein established the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, which funds science research and education Prior to 2003, the foundation funded Martin Nowak's research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey In May 2003, Epstein pledged a series of donations totaling US$30 million to create a mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics program at Harvard which was run by Martin Nowak [292] According to The Boston Globe, the actual amount received from Epstein was US$6.5 million [128] [292] [293] In 2019, Forbes deleted a 2013 article that called Epstein \"one of the largest backers of cutting edge science\" after The New York Times revealed its author, Drew Hendricks, had been paid $600 to submit it falsely as his own [205]\n\n\nInterest in eugenics and transhumanism\nAccording to various sources, beginning in the early-2000s Epstein developed a strong interest in \"improving\" the human race through genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, including using his own sperm He addressed the scientific community at various events and occasions and communicated his fascination with eugenics [301] It was reported in August 2019 that Epstein had planned to \"seed the human race with his DNA\" by impregnating up to twenty women at a time using his New Mexico compound as a \"baby ranch\", where mothers would give birth to his offspring He was an advocate of cryonics and his own idiosyncratic version of transhumanism, and had said that he intended to have his penis and head frozen [302] [303]\n\n\nDeath\nOn July 23, 2019, Epstein was found injured and semiconscious at 1:30 a.m on the floor of his cell, with marks around his neck [305] [306] His cellmate, former New York City police officer Nicholas Tartaglione, who was at the time awaiting trial for four counts of murder, was questioned about Epstein's condition He denied having any knowledge of what happened Correctional staff suspected attempted suicide, but did not rule out the possibility that it was staged or that he was assaulted by another inmate [304] [307] [135] [308] [306] According to NBC News, two sources said that Epstein might have tried to hang himself, a third said the injuries were not serious and could have been staged, and a fourth source said that an assault by his cellmate had not been ruled out [304] After that incident, he was placed on suicide watch [305] [309] Six days later, on July 29, 2019, Epstein was taken off suicide watch and placed in a special housing unit with another inmate [305] Epstein's close associates said he was in \"good spirits\" [12]\n\n\nAutopsy\nOn August 11, 2019, an autopsy was performed [317] It appeared likely that Epstein had thrown himself violently off the cell's top bunk, which would explain the damage he suffered, other than strangulation [318] The preliminary result of the autopsy found that Epstein sustained multiple breaks in his neck bones Among the bones broken in Epstein's neck was the hyoid bone Such breaks of the hyoid bone can occur from those who hang themselves, but they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation A 2010 study found broken hyoids in twenty-five percent of cases of hangings A larger study conducted from 2010 to 2016 found hyoid damage in just 16 of 264, or six percent, of cases of hangings Hyoid bone breaks become more common with age, as the bones become more brittle [319] Forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht noted that hanging by leaning forward would not result in broken cervical bones [320]\n\n\nFinal will\nOn August 18, 2019, it was reported that Jeffrey Epstein had signed his last will and testament on August 8, 2019, two weeks after being found injured in his cell and two days before his death [304] [324] Until this time, Epstein had been depositing money in other inmates' commissary accounts to avoid being attacked [305] The signing of the will was witnessed by two attorneys that knew him The will named two longtime employees as executors, and immediately gifted all of his assets, and any assets remaining in his estate, to a trust [324]\n\n\nBurial\nFollowing the autopsy, Epstein's body was claimed by his brother Mark [325] [326] On September 5, 2019, Epstein's body was buried in an unmarked grave next to those of his parents at the I.J Morris Star of David Cemetery in Palm Beach, Florida The names of his parents were also removed from their tombstone in order to prevent vandalism [327]\n\n\nInvestigations\nAttorney General Barr ordered an investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General in addition to the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, saying that he was \"appalled\" by Epstein's death in federal custody [12] [328] Two days later Barr said there had been \"serious irregularities\" in the prison's handling of Epstein, promising: \"We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be accountability.\" [329] On August 14, 2019, Manhattan federal court Judge Richard M Berman, who was overseeing Epstein's criminal case, wrote to the Metropolitan Correctional Center warden Lamine N'Diaye inquiring as to whether an investigation into the millionaire's apparent suicide would include a probe into his prior (July 23) injuries Judge Berman wrote that to his knowledge it has never been definitely explained what they concluded about the incident [330]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nEpstein's death became the subject of widespread controversy and debate, with the belief that his death was a homicide becoming a popular meme [348] HBO is creating a limited series on Epstein's life and death to be directed and executive produced by Adam McKay [349] [350] Sony Pictures Television is additionally developing a miniseries based on Epstein's life [351] In the season four finale of the CBS series The Good Fight, the plot revolves around Epstein's death [352] [353] The Netflix documentary series Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich premiered in May 2020 [354] The Lifetime documentary Surviving Jeffrey Epstein premiered in August 2020 [355]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Jeffrey Epstein\n\nIntroduction\n\nJeffrey Epstein was a wealthy and influential financier, philanthropist, and convicted sex offender. Born on January 20, 1953, in Brooklyn, New York, Epstein was the older of two siblings and grew up in the working-class neighborhood of Sea Gate, Coney Island, Brooklyn. He was referred to as \"Bear\" by his parents, while his younger brother, Mark, was known as \"Puggie.\" Epstein's parents, Pauline \"Paula\" Stolofsky (1918-2004) and Seymour George Epstein (1916-1991), were Jewish and had married in 1952 shortly before his birth. His father worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation as a groundskeeper and gardener.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nEpstein started working in September 1974 as a physics and mathematics teacher for teens at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. However, it is unclear if he actually had the necessary credentials to teach at the school. Donald Barr, who served as the headmaster until June 1974, was known to have made several unconventional recruitments at the time, although it is unclear if he had a direct role in hiring Epstein. Three months after Barr's departure, Epstein began to teach at the school.\n\nBanking and Financial Consulting\n\nEpstein joined Bear Stearns in 1976 as a low-level junior assistant to a floor trader. He swiftly moved up to become an options trader, working in the special products division, and then advised the bank's wealthiest clients, such as Seagram president Edgar Bronfman, on tax mitigation strategies. Jimmy Cayne, the bank's later chief executive officer, praised Epstein's skill with wealthy clients and complex products. In 1980, four years after joining Bear Stearns, Epstein became a limited partner. In 1981, Epstein was asked to leave Bear Stearns for, according to his sworn testimony, being guilty of a \"Reg D violation.\"\n\nFinancial Consulting\n\nIn August 1981, Epstein founded his own consulting firm, Intercontinental Assets Group Inc (IAG), which assisted clients in recovering stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers. Epstein described his work at this time as being a high-level bounty hunter. He told friends that he worked sometimes as a consultant for governments and the very wealthy to recover embezzled funds, while at other times he worked for clients who had embezzled funds.\n\nTowers Financial Corporation\n\nSteven Hoffenberg hired Epstein in 1987 as a consultant for Towers Financial Corporation (unaffiliated with the company of the same name founded in 1998, and acquired by Old National Bancorp in 2014), a collection agency that bought debts people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. Hoffenberg set Epstein up in offices in the Villard Houses in Manhattan and paid him $25,000 per month for his consulting work.\n\nFinancial Management Firm\n\nIn 1988, while Epstein was still consulting for Hoffenberg, he founded his financial management firm, J Epstein & Company. The company was said by Epstein to have been formed to manage the assets of clients with more than $1 billion in net worth, although others have expressed skepticism that he was restrictive of the clients that he took.\n\nMedia Activities\n\nIn 2003, Epstein bid to acquire New York magazine. Other bidders included advertising executive Donny Deutsch, investor Nelson Peltz, media mogul and New York Daily News publisher Mortimer Zuckerman, and film producer Harvey Weinstein. The ultimate buyer was Bruce Wasserstein, a longtime Wall Street investment banker, who paid $55 million.\n\nLiquid Funding Ltd.\n\nEpstein was the president of the company Liquid Funding Ltd between 2000 and 2007. The company was an early pioneer in expanding the kind of debt that could be accepted on repurchase, or the repo market, which involves a lender giving money to a borrower in exchange for securities that the borrower then agrees to buy back at an agreed-upon later time and price. The innovation of Liquid Funding, and other early companies, was that instead of having stocks and bonds as the underlying securities, it had commercial mortgages and investment-grade residential mortgages bundled into complex securities as the underlying security.\n\nInvestments\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, a hedge fund that invested in illiquid debt securities. In November 2006, Epstein attempted to redeem his investment after he was informed of accounting irregularities in the fund. By this time, his investment had grown to $140 million. The D.B Zwirn fund refused to redeem the investment. Hedge funds that invest in illiquid securities typically have years-long \"lockups\" on their capital for all investors and require redemption requests to be made in writing 60 to 90 days in advance. The fund was closed in 2008, and its remaining assets of approximately $2 billion, including Epstein's investment, were transferred to Fortress Investment Group when that firm bought the assets in 2009. Epstein later went to arbitration with Fortress over his redemption attempt.\n\nHedge Funds\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, a hedge fund that invested in illiquid debt securities.

The startup was connected with Israel's defense industry. It was headed by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was also at one time the defense minister, and chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The CEO of the company is Amir Elihai, a special forces officer, and Pinchas Bukhris, a director of the company and former defense ministry director general and commander of IDF cyber unit 8200. Epstein and Barak, the head of Carbyne, were close, and Epstein often offered him lodging at one of his apartment units at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan.

J Epstein & Company [58] [43] The company was said by Epstein to have been formed to manage the assets of clients with more than US$1 billion in net worth, although others have expressed skepticism that he was restrictive of the clients that he took [29]\n\n\nMedia activities\nIn 2003, Epstein bid to acquire New York magazine [65] Other bidders included advertising executive Donny Deutsch, investor Nelson Peltz, media mogul and New York Daily News publisher Mortimer Zuckerman, and film producer Harvey Weinstein The ultimate buyer was Bruce Wasserstein, a longtime Wall Street investment banker, who paid US$55 million [65]\n\n\nLiquid Funding Ltd.\nEpstein was the president of the company Liquid Funding Ltd between 2000 and 2007 [67] [68] The company was an early pioneer in expanding the kind of debt that could be accepted on repurchase, or the repo market, which involves a lender giving money to a borrower in exchange for securities that the borrower then agrees to buy back at an agreed-upon later time and price The innovation of Liquid Funding, and other early companies, was that instead of having stocks and bonds as the underlying securities, it had commercial mortgages and investment-grade residential mortgages bundled into complex securities as the underlying security [67]\n\n\nInvestments\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B Zwirn Special Opportunities Fund, a hedge fund that invested in illiquid debt securities [70] [71] In November 2006, Epstein attempted to redeem his investment after he was informed of accounting irregularities in the fund [72] By this time, his investment had grown to $140 million The D.B Zwirn fund refused to redeem the investment Hedge funds that invest in illiquid securities typically have years-long \"lockups\" on their capital for all investors and require redemption requests to be made in writing 60 to 90 days in advance [70] The fund was closed in 2008, and its remaining assets of approximately $2 billion, including Epstein's investment, were transferred to Fortress Investment Group when that firm bought the assets in 2009 [70] [71] Epstein later went to arbitration with Fortress over his redemption attempt The outcome of that arbitration is not publicly known [70]\n\n\nHedge funds\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Epstein invested $80 million in the D.B Zwirn Special

startup Reporty Homeland Security (rebranded as Carbyne in 2018) [79] [80] [81] The startup was connected with Israel's defense industry It was headed by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was also at one time the defense minister, and chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) The CEO of the company is Amir Elihai, a special forces officer, and Pinchas Bukhris, a director of the company and former defense ministry director general and commander of IDF cyber unit 8200 [82] Epstein and Barak, the head of Carbyne, were close, and Epstein often offered him lodging at one of his apartment units at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan [83] [84] Epstein had past experience with Israel's research and military sector [85] In April 2008, he went to Israel and met with a number of research scientists and visited different Israeli military bases [85]\n\n\nVideo recordings\nEpstein installed concealed cameras in numerous places on his properties to allegedly record sexual activity with underage girls of prominent people for criminal purposes such as blackmail [86] Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's long-term girlfriend and companion, told a friend that Epstein's private island in the Virgin Islands was completely wired for video and the friend believed that Maxwell and Epstein were videotaping everyone on the island as an insurance policy [87] When police raided his Palm Beach residence in 2006, two hidden cameras were discovered in his home [88] It was also reported that Epstein's mansion in New York was wired extensively with a video surveillance system [89]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nIn March 2005, a woman contacted Florida's Palm Beach Police Department and alleged that her 14-year-old stepdaughter had been taken to Epstein's mansion by an older girl While there, she was allegedly paid $300 (equivalent to $470 in 2023) to strip and massage Epstein [94] She had allegedly undressed, but left the encounter wearing her underwear [95] Palm Beach Police began a thirteen-month undercover investigation of Epstein, including a search of his home [73] [96] During the investigation, Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter publicly accused the Palm Beach County state prosecutor, Barry Krischer, of being too lenient and called for help from the FBI [94]\n\n\nFirst criminal case (2005–2011)\nIn March 2005, a woman contacted Florida's Palm Beach Police

mansion by an older girl While there, she was allegedly paid $300 (equivalent to $470 in 2023) to strip and massage Epstein [94] She had allegedly undressed, but left the encounter wearing her

FBI began its own investigation of Epstein, nicknamed \"Operation Leap Year\" [112] It resulted in a fifty-three page indictment in June 2007 [73] Alexander Acosta, then the U.S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, agreed to a plea deal, which Alan Dershowitz helped to negotiate, [113] to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges to Epstein, along with four named co-conspirators and any unnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" According to the Miami Herald, the non-prosecution agreement \"essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein's sex crimes\" At the time, this halted the investigation and sealed the indictment The Miami Herald said: \"Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims.\" [77]\n\n\nConviction and sentencing (2008–2011)\nOn June 30, 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18, [119] he was sentenced to eighteen months in prison While most convicted sex offenders in Florida are sent to state prison, Epstein was instead housed in a private wing of the Palm Beach County Stockade and, according to the sheriff's office, was, after 3+1⁄2 months, allowed to leave the jail on \"work release\" for up to twelve hours a day, six days a week This contravened the sheriff's own policies requiring a maximum remaining sentence of ten months and making sex offenders ineligible for the privilege He was allowed to come and go outside of specified release hours [102]\n\n\nReactions\nThe immunity agreement and Epstein's lenient treatment were the subject of ongoing public dispute The Palm Beach police chief accused the state of giving him preferential treatment, [94] and the Miami Herald said U.S Attorney Acosta gave Epstein \"the deal of a lifetime\" [77] Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019, on sex trafficking charges, Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor effective July 19, 2019 [127]\n\n\nSecond criminal case (2019)\nOn July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested by the FBI-NYPD Crimes Against Children Task Force at Teterboro

his arrest, about a dozen FBI agents forced open the door to his Manhattan townhouse, the Herbert N Straus House, with search warrants The search of his townhouse turned up evidence of sex trafficking and also found \"hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs of fully – or partially – nude females\" Some of the photos were confirmed as those of underage females In a locked safe, compact discs were found with handwritten labels including the descriptions: \"Young  [Name] +  [Name]\", \"Misc nudes 1\", and \"Girl pics nude\" [92]\n\n\nSex trafficking charges\nOn

investigation into Epstein, after Yael Mellul wrote to the Paris prosecutor to report the international dimensions of the pedophile network involving Jeffrey Epstein, criticizing the slow pace of justice [143] He is being investigated for rape and sexual assault of minors under and over the age of 15, criminal association with a view to committing crimes, and association with criminals with a view to committing offenses The prosecutors said that the goal of the investigation is to find possible crimes committed in France and elsewhere against French citizens [144]\n\n\nCivil cases\nOn

he got his fortune started through Robert Maxwell, the media mogul father of Ghislaine Maxwell [260] [261] When Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting and procuring prostitution, his lawyers stated he was a billionaire with a net worth of over one billion dollars [259] A number of sources, however, have questioned the extent of Epstein's wealth and his status as a billionaire According to an article in The New York Times, his \"fortune may be more illusion than fact\" Epstein lost \"large sums of money\" in the 2008 financial crisis, and \"friends and patrons\"—including retail billionaire Leslie Wexner—\"deserted him\" following his pleading guilty to prostitution charges in 2008 [58] New York magazine claimed that \"there's scant proof\" of Epstein's \"financial bona fides\", [259] and Forbes also ran an article entitled \"Why sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is not a billionaire\" [262]\n\n\nResidences\nEpstein owned the Herbert N Straus House on 9 East 71st Street in the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City [269] [270] It was originally purchased for $13.2 million in 1989 by Epstein's mentor, Les Wexner, who renovated it completely [132] [271] [272] Epstein moved into the mansion in 1995 after Wexner married and moved with his wife to Columbus, Ohio, to raise their family [29] [271] He took full possession of the mansion in 1998, when he paid Wexner $20 million for it [58] The house was valued in 2019 by federal prosecutors at $77 million, while the city assessed its value at $56 million [269] The mansion is reputedly the largest private residence in Manhattan at 21,000 sq ft (2,000 m2) [132] [269] Hidden under a flight of stairs, there is a lead-lined bathroom fitted with its own closed-circuit television screens and a telephone,

campaign for Attorney General of New Mexico He later contributed $35,000 to King's 2014 unsuccessful campaign for Governor Other contributions in New Mexico included $10,000 toward Jim Baca's campaign to become head of the land commission and $2,000 toward Santa Fe County Sheriff Jim Solano's bid for reelection In 2010, Epstein received a notice from New Mexico Department of Public Safety which said, \"You are not required to register  [as a sex offender] with the state of New Mexico.\" This was in contravention of federal law, which would seem to say that the conviction in Florida required him to register in New Mexico [284]\n\n\nAlleged connections to intelligence\nEpstein was rumored to be associated with intelligence [285] The U.S journalists Dylan Howard, Melissa Cronin and James Robertson linked Epstein to the Israeli Mossad in their book Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales They relied for the most part on the former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe [286] According to him, Epstein's activities as a spy served to gather compromising material on powerful people in order to blackmail them [287] There is also a possible connection to the Mossad via Ghislaine Maxwell, whose father Robert Maxwell is said to have had contacts with the Mossad [288] Epstein's victim Virginia Giuffre also alleged Epstein to be an intelligence asset, linking on Twitter to a Reddit page, that alleged Epstein being a spy, running a blackmail operation [289]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn 1991, Epstein was one of four donors who pledged to raise US$2 million for a Hillel student building

amount received from Epstein was US$6.5 million [128] [292] [293] In 2019, Forbes deleted a 2013 article that called Epstein \"one of the largest backers of cutting edge science\" after The New York Times revealed its author, Drew Hendricks, had been paid $600 to submit it falsely as his own [205]\n\n\nInterest in eugenics and transhumanism\nAccording to various sources, beginning in the early-2000s Epstein developed a strong interest in \"improving\" the human race through genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, including using his own sperm He addressed the scientific community at various events and occasions and communicated his fascination with eugenics [301] It was reported in August 2019 that Epstein had planned to \"seed the human race with his DNA\" by impregnating up to twenty women at a time using his New Mexico compound as a \"baby ranch\", where mothers would give birth to his offspring He was an advocate of cryonics and his own idiosyncratic version of transhumanism, and had said that he intended to have his penis and head frozen [302] [303]\n\n\nDeath\nOn July 23, 2019, Epstein was found injured and semiconscious at 1:30 a.m on the floor of his cell, with marks around his neck [305] [306] His cellmate, former New York City police officer Nicholas Tartaglione, who was at the time awaiting trial for four counts of murder, was questioned about Epstein's condition He denied having any knowledge of what happened Correctional staff suspected attempted suicide, but did not rule out the possibility that it was staged or that he was assaulted by another inmate [304] [307] [135] [308] [306] According to NBC News, two sources said that Epstein might have tried to hang himself, a third said the injuries were not serious and could have been staged, and a fourth source said that an assault by his cellmate had not been ruled out [304] After that incident, he was placed on suicide watch [305] [309] Six days later, on July 29, 2019, Epstein was taken off suicide watch and placed in a special housing unit with another inmate [305] Epstein's close associates said he was in \"good spirits\" [12]\n\n\nAutopsy\nOn August 11, 2019, an autopsy was performed [317] It appeared likely that Epstein had thrown himself violently off the cell's top bunk, which would explain the damage he suffered, other than strangulation [318] The preliminary result of the autopsy found that Epstein sustained multiple breaks in his neck bones Among the bones broken in Epstein's neck was the hyoid bone Such breaks of the hyoid bone can occur from those who hang themselves, but they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation A 2010 study found broken hyoids in twenty-five percent of cases of hangings A larger study conducted from 2010 to 2016 found hyoid damage in just 16 of 264, or six percent, of cases of hangings Hyoid bone breaks become more common with age, as the bones become more brittle [319] Forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht noted that hanging by leaning forward would not result in broken cervical bones [320]\n\n\nFinal will\nOn August 18, 2019, it was reported that Jeffrey Epstein had signed his last will and testament on August 8, 2019, two weeks after being found injured in his cell and two days before his death [304] [324] Until this time, Epstein had been depositing money in other inmates' commissary accounts to avoid being attacked [305] The signing of the will was witnessed by two attorneys that knew him The will named two longtime employees as executors, and immediately gifted all of his assets, and any assets remaining in his estate, to a trust [324]\n\n\nBurial\nFollowing the autopsy, Epstein's body was claimed by his brother Mark [325] [326] On September 5, 2019, Epstein's body was buried in an unmarked grave next to those of his parents at the I.J Morris Star of David Cemetery in Palm Beach, Florida The names of his parents were also removed from their tombstone in order to prevent vandalism [327]\n\n\nInvestigations\nAttorney General Barr ordered an investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General in addition to the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, saying that he was \"appalled\" by Epstein's death in federal custody [12] [328] Two days later Barr said there had been \"serious irregularities\" in the prison's handling of Epstein, promising: \"We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be accountability.\" [329] On August 14, 2019, Manhattan federal court Judge Richard M Berman, who was overseeing Epstein's criminal case, wrote to the Metropolitan Correctional Center warden Lamine N'Diaye inquiring as to whether an investigation into the millionaire's apparent suicide would include a probe into his prior (July 23) injuries Judge Berman wrote that to his knowledge it has never been definitely explained what they concluded about the incident [330]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nEpstein's death became the subject of widespread controversy and debate, with the belief that his death was a homicide becoming a popular meme [348] HBO is creating a limited series on Epstein's life and death to be directed and executive produced by Adam McKay [349] [350] Sony Pictures Television is additionally developing a miniseries based on Epstein's life [351] In the season four finale of the CBS series The Good Fight, the plot revolves around Epstein's death [352] [353] The Netflix documentary series Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich premiered in May 2020 [354] The Lifetime documentary Surviving Jeffrey Epstein premiered in August 2020 [355]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Wiccan_(comics)", "content": "\nPublication history\nWiccan first appeared in Young Avengers #1 (April 2005) The issue was scripted by Allan Heinberg and drawn by Jim Cheung One of the original four members of the Young Avengers, the team was founded after the Avengers disbanded in the story line Avengers Disassembled.\n\n\nWilliam Maximoff\nThomas Maximoff and William Maximoff were twins born to the superhuman sorceress Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, and the android hero Vision, both members of the Avengers The pregnancy and births were the result of Scarlet Witch temporarily tapping into a great source of magical energy that allowed her to grant herself a wish for family [10] Later, the twins are taken by the villain Master Pandemonium, a servant of the demon lord Mephisto Mephisto claims that after his defeat at the hands of the powerful Franklin Richards, [11] his essence was divided into several pieces and scattered, and that Wanda inadvertently used two of these pieces to give life to her twins, who in reality are magical constructs Mephisto then apparently wiped the boys Thomas and William from existence, reabsorbing their energy [12] Following these events, Wanda and Vision end their marriage.\n\n\nBilly Kaplan\nWilliam \"Billy\" Kaplan is the eldest of three sons born to Jeff Kaplan, a cardiologist, and Rebecca Kaplan, a psychologist.\n\n\nYoung Avengers\nBefore his destruction, Vision created a protocol to activate and recruit a team of young people with superhuman abilities and who are connected in some way to the Avengers team One of those selected is Billy, indicating that Vision and others learned his power was similar to that of Wanda Maximoff Iron Lad, a young and uncorrupted version of the villain Kang the Conqueror, becomes leader of these Young Avengers Initially, Billy chooses the codename Asgardian During the team's initial adventures, Billy starts flirting with teammate Teddy Altman, the shape-shifter called Hulkling [17]\n\n\nWiccan & Speed\nBilly has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers Billy joins Tommy as they search for the Scarlet Witch through Genosha and Wundagore before finally encountering Master Pandemonium at a former residence of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision Master Pandemonium decides not to fight the boys after recognizing Wiccan's magic as being the same as the Scarlet Witch's Instead, he elaborates on their history concerning Mephisto and the Scarlet Witch and advises them that the history they search for is filled with \"darkness and chaos\" and that they should embrace who they are in the present [volume & issue needed]\n\n\nCivil War\nDuring the Civil War, Billy and Tommy plan to look for Wanda S.H.I.E.L.D arrests the Young Avengers Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Steve Rogers (Captain America) intercept the S.H.I.E.L.D bus which is transporting the prisoners and Wiccan teleports the team out of the situation, into the Resistance Fighters base of operations [18]\n\n\nThe Search for the Scarlet Witch\nWiccan and Speed later search for the Scarlet Witch following the events of Civil War While Billy and Tommy both search for Wanda (referring to her as \"Mom\") they encounter Master Pandemonium, who recognizes Wiccan's magic as that of the Scarlet Witch and further explains their original history as the Scarlet Witch's children However, he likens the boys' search for their past and Wanda to his own former life as rising actor, and tells them that their past was \"darkness and chaos\" and advises them that they should embrace who they are now This appears to have satisfied Wiccan, who calls off his search for now, deciding that he is happy with the person he is and the people in his life [25]\n\n\nSkrull Invasion\nBilly, with the other Young Avengers, teams up with the Runaways again when the Skrulls invade [26]\n\n\nDark Reign and Siege\nWiccan gathers the Young Avengers together at the Avengers Mansion to respond to wave of supernatural chaos caused by Chthon The team is turned to stone by Chthon's magic, except for Vision and Stature, who arrive too late [27]\n\n\nThe Children's Crusade\nDuring a fight between a group of nuclear-armed Sons of the Serpent and the Young Avengers, Wiccan loses control of his powers and renders the entire group of terrorists comatose The Avengers arrive and take Wiccan to their base stating that they want to examine his full capabilities, concerned that, like the Scarlet Witch, if he were to lose control of his powers, he could cause massive devastation In the process, the Avengers reveal to the team that the Scarlet Witch, having had a mental break after losing her twin sons, killed several of her teammates, changed all of reality into House of M, and then was responsible for the depowering and deaths of millions of mutants Wiccan reiterates his belief that he and Speed are truly the transposed souls of the Scarlet Witch's children and that she may not have been purposefully behind those events Seeing the Avengers' and his friends' distrust of the Scarlet Witch and their discomfort with him due to uncertainty of his powers, he storms out, only to find that Captain America has informed his parents of what occurred during the early battle Wiccan, accompanied by Hulkling, goes with Captain America and is situated for observation However, the other Young Avengers decide to break them out, urging Wiccan to search for the Scarlet Witch By showing her that the children she lost may be alive and well, the Young Avengers believe that she may be cured of her illness and be able to reverse the damage she had done In particular, Stature hopes that locating and curing the Scarlet Witch could mean a chance at reviving her father Immediately, Magneto arrives, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather [34]\n\n\nBattle against Mother\nSome time later, it is revealed that the group went their separate ways due to their several losses Billy and Teddy are living together with Billy's parents Billy discovers though that Teddy has broken their promise to give up being superheroes by fighting crime at night After getting into an argument, Billy tries to make it up to Teddy by shuffling through different realities to find one identical to theirs at the moment before Teddy's mother died Billy finds this moment and brings Teddy's mother back to life However, the Mother soon displays strange abilities and attempts to kill Billy and Teddy, with somehow Billy's parents not noticing After escaping her, they run into Loki, who due to recent events, is a child again He tells them that the Mother is not actually Teddy's mom, but a parasite from the multiverse who takes the guise of whatever travelers are looking for Due to its strange abilities, adults are oblivious to whatever happens around the Mother, and any parents around them become part of her personal army (save for Scarlet Witch, who is able to resist, but still remains oblivious to what is going on, as with the rest of the Avengers) The three soon reunite with Kate, who has been having one night stands with Noh-Varr, while joined by America Chavez, a god from another universe with super-strength and the ability to kick holes in reality Discovering that any parents around the group fall prey to Mother's spell, the group uses Noh-Varr's ship to leave Earth, while Loki will train Billy in magic to hopefully reverse what he has done On their travels, Loki talks to Teddy about Billy's powers, saying that it's highly unlikely that some attractive alien prince would just happen to find Billy, happen to be gay, and happen to fall in love with him Teddy begins to wonder if he was indeed created by Billy to fill a hole in his life Soon they are summoned back to Earth by former X-Men member David Alleyne, who has been working a temp job with Tommy According to him, a mysterious figure wearing Patriot's old outfit kidnapped Tommy, and he requires their help to find him Apparently, Tommy was brought to another reality, and America uses her powers to let them travel between worlds The group hop from universe to universe for a while, eventually finding a universe of adorable creatures worshipping Billy as a god named 'the Demiurge' Loki and America have been trying to hide this from Billy for a while, but they reveal that one day he shall become an entity known as the Demiurge, and during his time as this being, will change the laws of magic in every universe and every time period, past, present, and future However, the group is soon ambushed by Mother while in between universes, and they become separated When reuniting, Teddy tells Billy and what he and Loki discussed, and the two separate while on Earth Teddy takes a break from the group, soon finding a support group for those wronged by the Young Avengers, apparently led by Mother Mother kidnaps Teddy, and the Young Avengers prepare to save him Loki develops a plan to have Billy access a fraction of the Demiurge's power, which should be enough to kill Mother Thinking they will be outnumbered by the armies Mother has been amassing made up of other-universe versions of the group and the parents she has brainwashed, David calls every super-powered hero under the age of 23 to help them fight, while all the world's older heroes and villains remain unaware that any of this is happening Loki, however, tells Billy that Loki can only help if he is at full power, and Billy uses a spell to restore Loki to a young adult Loki and Billy prepare to give Billy near-unlimited power while the battle in central park begins between Mother's army and the world's teenage and young adult heroes Kate, America, Noh-Varr, and David save Teddy, Teddy finding Billy on the battlefield, who is unable to access his power Teddy tells him it is okay, and the two kiss, this being the spark Billy needed to access the Demiurge Billy uses his moment of power to successfully kill Mother, getting rid of her spell and any trace of her through the multiverse Billy reunites with his parents, introducing them to the group, though Loki has vanished Later, a party is being held at a club by a mysterious benefactor, which the group and all the heroes who fought in the battle attend Here, Billy and Teddy are shown to be once again in a happy relationship The Young Avengers soon get ready to leave, save for Loki, who was watching from a distance, and was the benefactor for the party The group leaves, as Loki reminisces while looking at a selfie they all took during their journeys together [40]\n\n\nNew Avengers\nLoki and America's prophecy comes true soon after Billy and Teddy are recruited by Sunspot to become members of the New Avengers, a team working alongside A.I.M A group of Kree-Skrull hybrids arrive on Earth, intending for Teddy to finally ascend to his position as the Emperor who will unite the two warring races Unable to stop their teleportation ray, Billy goes with him to their planet whilst the rest of the team attempt a rescue Upon reaching the planet, they discover that one of the hybrids has been taken over by a ghost wizard named Moridun He is killed by Teddy who resolves to return and take his place as Emperor when he is ready Unbeknownst to the New Avengers, Moridun was not destroyed and has actually taken over Billy, who changes his codename to Demiurge Under the control of Moridun, Billy begins acting weird, suggesting that they should kill some of the thieves they are fighting It is only when a group of future avengers travel back in time to warn them does Teddy realise what has happened Despite the future avengers preparing to kill Billy, Teddy encourages him to fight and he successfully drives Moridun out of his body, averting the huge amount of death that was to be caused Later, Sunspot goes rogue, separating A.I.M from the New Avengers and abandoning the team.\n\n\nWar of the Realms\nWhen Dark Elves invade Manhattan, Billy is summoned by Loki, who is initially disguised as Kate Bishop, to a drag bar where he attempts to convince him to side with Malekith in the war Loki tries to gain Billy's forgiveness for attempting to manipulate him and steal the power of the demiurge when they both served as Young Avengers but he refuses, telling him it is not his place as he was not the only one wronged While fighting Malekith's forces, Billy and Teddy see Loki's murder at the hands of Laufey and silently embrace [42]\n\n\nStrikeforce\nBilly suddenly finds himself in a medical facility handling biological weaponry alongside Angela, Spider-Woman, Spectrum and Winter Soldier with no memory of how he came to be there He is taken into custody with the others and is greeted by Blade, who explains that the group were taken over by mysterious shapeshifters and framed for their actions Angela quickly identifies these shapeshifters as Asgardian and the team track them to their base Wiccan is reluctant to join the mission, believing that they are doing the wrong thing by keeping the Avengers in the dark about their mission but he is convinced that it is best if only a small group of people know about the shapeshifters as their power comes from people having knowledge of them The group is attacked by Daimon Hellstrom and, assuming he is a shapeshifter in disguise, Blade kills him before receiving a phone call from Satana who explains that her brother is with her in Las Vegas and is acting strangely The team go to Satana's club and Wiccan is tasked with destroying the shapeshifter but stresses that his powers do not allow him to resurrect Hellstrom Destroying the shapeshifter causes it to burst into a swarm of smaller creatures who capture Wiccan, take his form and send the fake Wiccan to meet with Hulkling [43] The shapeshifters keep the real Wiccan in a cell where they reveal that they have also captured Doctor Doom and command Wiccan to use his powers to gain Doom's secrets Due to his history with Doom, Wiccan is apprehensive but quickly learns that they have captured a Doombot and have no idea that it is not the real Doctor Doom Wiccan animates the Doombot and uses it to escape The team retreat to a safehouse where Wiccan confronts the newly resurrected Daimon Hellstrom about why he was working with the shapeshifters [44]\n\n\nEmpyre\nTeddy later accepts his heritage and the mantle of \"Dorrek VIII\" at the cost of leaving Billy, becomes the new ruler of the Kree–Skrull Alliance, upon which he begins preparations to invade Earth for \"the final war\" [45] When Hulkling had to break ties with Wiccan, he states that he'll be on Earth when he returns [46]\n\n\nKing in Black: Wiccan and Hulkling\nAfter the events of Empyre, the Shi'ar empire offer Teddy and Billy, the newly crowned emperor and court wizard, the gift of a honeymoon on the empire's private beaches of the planet Little Chandilar, complete with a complimentary champagne-dispensing robot The newlyweds, along with Teddy's personal security (Kree Accuser Lauri-ell), agree to this and prepare for their vacation However, just as they begin to settle in, the planet is attacked by the symbiote dragons of Knull Wiccan and Hulkling quickly spring into action to fight off the horde so that Lauri-ell can lead the civilians to an escape on the Kree/Skrull Alliance's ship While searching the hangar, Lauri-ell finds a Kree ship landing but discovers that it is piloted by more symbiotes After defeating the dragons, Billy and Teddy attempt to gain some time to themselves, but are interrupted by Lauri-ell, followed by the symbiotes A short battle ensues, resulting in a collapsed corridor with Teddy stuck alone on one side with the symbiotes He tells the others to leave him and begin the evacuation, then proceeds to attempt to hold the symbiotes off They overpower him and begin to win, but he is soon saved by the friendly Champaign robot's flamethrower The flames cause the symbiotes to recoil and reveal that they are controlling the bodies of Kree soldiers [51]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nAs Wiccan, Billy Kaplan is able to manipulate magical energies which allows him to alter and warp reality at will [52] While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning-based spells By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down force-fields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, astral projection, and telekinetic force beams.\n\n\nParentage\nHeinberg stated on the situation in a transcript with fans, \"According to Billy's theory, the souls of Wanda's twins inhabited his and Tommy's bodies when they were dispersed from Mephisto But it's only a theory.\" [56] He also stated in another interview that his plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda, stating \"If everything goes according to plan, Wanda will indeed return to Young Avengers early in Season Two, when Billy and Tommy embark on a search for the true source of their powers.\" [57] Indeed, the Young Avengers Present issue from March 2008 involves the \"twin brothers\" Wiccan and Speed looking for their \"mother Wanda\" [58]\n\n\nAnalogy to the Arthurian legend\nSeveral comics showed stark similarities between Wiccan and Hulkling and the mythological figures Merlin and King Arthur Both Arthur (at least in one popular version of the legend) and Hulkling grew up unaware of their destiny Both are prophesiesed to unite their people and bring peace, have a strong wizard on their side, use magical swords and become the beloved kings of a big kingdom/empire.\n\n\nRelationships\nExchanges between Wiccan and Hulkling shows that the two teens are definitely lovers [63] Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship, [64] [65] and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly [63]\n\n\nOrigin of name\nAsked about Billy's codename, Heinberg said \"It turns out that code names are the trickiest part of creating new characters When Kate suggests 'Wiccan' to Billy in Young Avengers #6, she, like me, was not thinking in terms of the specific religious practice of Wicca, but rather attempting to find a suitable counterpart for the word 'witch.' It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone with 'Wiccan.' And since adopting the code name, rest assured Billy has been doing his Wiccan homework, so keep reading...\" During their time fighting the Mother, Loki eventually questions Wiccan about his codename He complains that since he is a pagan deity, he takes some offence to its use, and jokingly states that he has a list of better names [70]\n\n\nReception\nHeinberg reported that when the relationship between Wiccan and Hulkling was initially suspected before its confirmation, most fans were supportive, with minimal negative reaction [71] Wiccan and Hulkling have been called \"Marvel's most prominent gay couple,\" and received praise for showing diversity and progression in comics [72] [73] While accepting the Corporate Vanguard Award for Marvel Entertainment at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Marvel's VP of Animation Development, Cort Lane, cited Wiccan and Hulkling's relationship as one of his favorite story lines featuring LGBT characters [74]\n\n\nCritical reception\nHeinberg

He first appeared in Young Avengers #1 (April 2005) and was created by writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung. Wiccan is a superhero and a member of the Young Avengers, a team of young heroes who are connected to the Avengers. He is also known as Billy Kaplan and is the son of Jeff and Rebecca Kaplan.\n\nPublication History\nWiccan first appeared in Young Avengers #1 (April 2005), created by writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung. He was one of the original four members of the Young Avengers, a team founded after the Avengers disbanded in the storyline Avengers Disassembled. Wiccan's origins are linked to the Scarlet Witch, who temporarily tapped into a great source of magical energy to grant herself a wish for family. This energy allowed her to conceive twins, but they were taken by the villain Master Pandemonium and later reabsorbed by him.\n\nWilliam Maximoff and William Kaplan\nWanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, and the android hero Vision, both members of the Avengers, had twins named Thomas and William Maximoff. However, the twins were taken by Master Pandemonium, a servant of the demon lord Mephisto.

the Conqueror, becomes leader of these Young Avengers Initially, Billy chooses the codename Asgardian During the team's initial adventures, Billy starts flirting with teammate Teddy Altman, the shape-shifter called Hulkling [17]\n\n\nWiccan & Speed\nBilly has said that Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, was his favorite Avenger, and it has been implied that his powers are linked to hers Billy joins Tommy as they search for the Scarlet Witch through Genosha and Wundagore before finally encountering Master Pandemonium at a former residence of the Scarlet Witch and the Vision Master Pandemonium decides not to fight the boys after recognizing Wiccan's magic as being the same as the Scarlet Witch's Instead, he elaborates on their history concerning Mephisto and the Scarlet Witch and advises them that the history they search for is filled with \"darkness and chaos\" and that they should embrace who they are in the present [volume & issue needed]\n\n\nCivil War\nDuring the

Witch following the events of Civil War While Billy and Tommy both search for Wanda (referring to her as \"Mom\") they encounter Master Pandemonium, who recognizes Wiccan's magic as that of the Scarlet Witch and further explains their original history as the Scarlet Witch's children However, he likens the boys' search for their past and Wanda to his own former life as rising actor, and tells them that their past was \"darkness and chaos\" and advises them that they should embrace who they are now This appears to have satisfied Wiccan, who calls off his search for now, deciding that he is happy with the person he is and the people in his life [25]\n\n\nSkrull Invasion\nBilly, with the other Young Avengers, teams up with the Runaways again when the Skrulls invade [26]\n\n\nDark Reign

renders the entire group of terrorists comatose The Avengers arrive and take Wiccan to their base stating that they want to examine his full capabilities, concerned that, like the Scarlet Witch, if he were to lose control of his powers, he could cause massive devastation In the process, the Avengers reveal to the team that the Scarlet Witch, having had a mental break after losing her twin sons, killed several of her teammates, changed all of reality into House of M, and then was responsible for the depowering and deaths of millions of mutants Wiccan reiterates his belief that he and Speed are truly the transposed souls of the Scarlet Witch's children and that she may not have been purposefully behind those events Seeing the Avengers' and his friends' distrust of the Scarlet Witch and their discomfort with him due to uncertainty of his powers, he storms out, only to find that Captain America has informed his parents of what occurred during the early battle Wiccan, accompanied by Hulkling, goes with Captain America and is situated for observation However, the other Young Avengers decide to break them out, urging Wiccan to search for the Scarlet Witch By showing her that the children she lost may be alive and well, the Young Avengers believe that she may be cured of her illness and be able to reverse the damage she had done In particular, Stature hopes that locating and curing the Scarlet Witch could mean a chance at reviving her father Immediately, Magneto arrives, stating that he wants Wiccan and Speed to finally know him as their grandfather [34]\n\n\nBattle against Mother\nSome time later, it is revealed that the group went their separate ways due to their several losses Billy and Teddy are living together with Billy's parents Billy discovers though that Teddy has broken their promise to give up being superheroes by fighting crime at night After getting into an argument, Billy tries to make it up to Teddy by shuffling through different realities to find one identical to theirs at the moment before Teddy's mother died Billy finds this moment and brings Teddy's mother back to life However, the Mother soon displays strange abilities and attempts to kill Billy and Teddy, with somehow Billy's parents not noticing After escaping her, they run into Loki, who due to recent events, is a child again He tells them that the Mother is not actually Teddy's mom, but a parasite from the multiverse who takes the guise of whatever travelers are looking for Due to its strange abilities, adults are oblivious to whatever happens around the Mother, and any parents around them become part of her personal army (save for Scarlet Witch, who is able to resist, but still remains oblivious to what is going on, as with the rest of the Avengers) The three soon reunite with Kate, who has been having one night stands with Noh-Varr, while joined by America Chavez, a god from another universe with super-strength and the ability to kick holes in reality Discovering that any parents around the group fall prey to Mother's spell, the group uses Noh-Varr's ship to leave Earth, while Loki will train Billy in magic to hopefully reverse what he has done On their travels, Loki talks to Teddy about Billy's powers, saying that it's highly unlikely that some attractive alien prince would just happen to find Billy, happen to be gay, and happen to fall in love with him Teddy begins to wonder if he was indeed created by Billy to fill a hole in his life Soon they are summoned back to Earth by former X-Men member David Alleyne, who has been working a temp job with Tommy According to him, a mysterious figure wearing Patriot's old outfit kidnapped Tommy, and he requires their help to find him Apparently, Tommy was brought to another reality, and America uses her powers to let them travel between worlds The group hop from universe to universe for a while, eventually finding a universe of adorable creatures worshipping Billy as a god named 'the Demiurge' Loki and America have been trying to hide this from Billy for a while, but they reveal that one day he shall become an entity known as the Demiurge, and during his time as this being, will change the laws of magic in every universe and every time period, past, present, and future However, the group is soon ambushed by Mother while in between universes, and they become separated When reuniting, Teddy tells Billy and what he and Loki discussed, and the two separate while on Earth Teddy takes a break from the group, soon finding a support group for those wronged by the Young Avengers, apparently led by Mother Mother kidnaps Teddy, and the Young Avengers prepare to save him Loki develops a plan to have Billy access a fraction of the Demiurge's power, which should be enough to kill Mother Thinking they will be outnumbered by the armies Mother has been amassing made up of other-universe versions of the group and the parents she has brainwashed, David calls every super-powered hero under the age of 23 to help them fight, while all the world's older heroes and villains remain unaware that any of this is happening Loki, however, tells Billy that Loki can only help if he is at full power, and Billy uses a spell to restore Loki to a young adult Loki and Billy prepare to give Billy near-unlimited power while the battle in central park begins between Mother's army and the world's teenage and young adult heroes Kate, America, Noh-Varr, and David save Teddy, Teddy finding Billy on the battlefield, who is unable to access his power Teddy tells him it is okay, and the two kiss, this being the spark Billy needed to access the Demiurge Billy uses his moment of power to successfully kill Mother, getting rid of her spell and any trace of her through the multiverse Billy reunites with his parents, introducing them to the group, though Loki has vanished Later, a party is being held at a club by a mysterious benefactor, which the group and all the heroes who fought in the battle attend Here, Billy and Teddy are shown to be once again in a happy relationship The Young Avengers soon get ready to leave, save for Loki, who was watching from a distance, and was the benefactor for the party The group leaves, as Loki reminisces while looking at a selfie they all took during their journeys together [40]\n\n\nNew Avengers\nLoki and America's prophecy comes true soon after Billy and Teddy are recruited by Sunspot to become members of the New Avengers, a team working alongside A.I.M A group of Kree-Skrull hybrids arrive on Earth, intending for Teddy to finally ascend to his position as the Emperor who will unite the two warring races Unable to stop their teleportation ray, Billy goes with him to their planet whilst the rest of the team attempt a rescue Upon reaching the planet, they discover that one of the hybrids has been taken over by a ghost wizard named Moridun He is killed by Teddy who resolves to return and take his place as Emperor when he is ready Unbeknownst to the New Avengers, Moridun was not destroyed and has actually taken over Billy, who changes his codename to Demiurge Under the control of Moridun, Billy begins acting weird, suggesting that they should kill some of the thieves they are fighting It is only when a group of future avengers travel back in time to warn them does Teddy realise what has happened Despite the future avengers preparing to kill Billy, Teddy encourages him to fight and he successfully drives Moridun out of his body, averting the huge amount of death that was to be caused Later, Sunspot goes rogue, separating A.I.M from the New Avengers and abandoning the team.\n\n\nWar of the Realms\nWhen Dark Elves invade Manhattan, Billy is summoned by Loki, who is initially disguised as Kate Bishop, to a drag bar where he attempts to convince him to side with Malekith in the war Loki tries to gain Billy's forgiveness for attempting to manipulate him and steal the power of the demiurge when they both served as Young Avengers but he refuses, telling him it is not his place as he was not the only one wronged While fighting Malekith's forces, Billy and Teddy see Loki's murder at the hands of Laufey and silently embrace [42]\n\n\nStrikeforce\nBilly suddenly finds himself in a medical facility handling biological weaponry alongside Angela, Spider-Woman, Spectrum and Winter Soldier with no memory of how he came to be there He is taken into custody with the others and is greeted by Blade, who explains that the group were taken over by mysterious shapeshifters and framed for their actions Angela quickly identifies these shapeshifters as Asgardian and the team track them to their base Wiccan is reluctant to join the mission, believing that they are doing the wrong thing by keeping the Avengers in the dark about their mission but he is convinced that it is best if only a small group of people know about the shapeshifters as their power comes from people having knowledge of them The group is attacked by Daimon Hellstrom and, assuming he is a shapeshifter in disguise, Blade kills him before receiving a phone call from Satana who explains that her brother is with her in Las Vegas and is acting strangely The team go to Satana's club and Wiccan is tasked with destroying the shapeshifter but stresses that his powers do not allow him to resurrect Hellstrom Destroying the shapeshifter causes it to burst into a swarm of smaller creatures who capture Wiccan, take his form and send the fake Wiccan to meet with Hulkling [43] The shapeshifters keep the real Wiccan in a cell where they reveal that they have also captured Doctor Doom and command Wiccan to use his powers to gain Doom's secrets Due to his history with Doom, Wiccan is apprehensive but quickly learns that they have captured a Doombot and have no idea that it is not the real Doctor Doom Wiccan animates the Doombot and uses it to escape The team retreat to a safehouse where Wiccan confronts the newly resurrected Daimon Hellstrom about why he was working with the shapeshifters [44]\n\n\nEmpyre\nTeddy later accepts his heritage and the mantle of \"Dorrek VIII\" at the cost of leaving Billy, becomes the new ruler of the Kree–Skrull Alliance, upon which he begins preparations to invade Earth for \"the final war\" [45] When Hulkling had to break ties with Wiccan, he states that he'll be on Earth when he returns [46]\n\n\nKing in Black: Wiccan and Hulkling\nAfter the events of Empyre, the Shi'ar empire offer Teddy and Billy, the newly crowned emperor and court wizard, the gift of a honeymoon on the empire's private beaches of the planet Little Chandilar, complete with a complimentary champagne-dispensing robot The newlyweds, along with Teddy's personal security (Kree Accuser Lauri-ell), agree to this and prepare for their vacation However, just as they begin to settle in, the planet is attacked by the symbiote dragons of Knull Wiccan and Hulkling quickly spring into action to fight off the horde so that Lauri-ell can lead the civilians to an escape on the Kree/Skrull Alliance's ship While searching the hangar, Lauri-ell finds a Kree ship landing but discovers that it is piloted by more symbiotes After defeating the dragons, Billy and Teddy attempt to gain some time to themselves, but are interrupted by Lauri-ell, followed by the symbiotes A short battle ensues, resulting in a collapsed corridor with Teddy stuck alone on one side with the symbiotes He tells the others to leave him and begin the evacuation, then proceeds to attempt to hold the symbiotes off They overpower him and begin to win, but he is soon saved by the friendly Champaign robot's flamethrower The flames cause the symbiotes to recoil and reveal that they are controlling the bodies of Kree soldiers [51]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nAs Wiccan, Billy Kaplan is able to manipulate magical energies which allows him to alter and warp reality at will [52] While patterning himself after Thor in the guise of Asgardian, Billy limited himself entirely to flight and lightning-based spells By stating an intent and focusing on the outcome, Wiccan is capable of a variety of feats, including, but not limited to tracking and locating others, illusionary disguises, tearing down force-fields, mass teleportation, concussive blasts, enchantments, astral projection, and telekinetic force beams.\n\n\nParentage\nHeinberg stated on the situation in a transcript with fans, \"According to Billy's theory, the souls of Wanda's twins inhabited his and Tommy's bodies when they were dispersed from Mephisto But it's only a theory.\" [56] He also stated in another interview that his plans for the new 'season' involved the two searching for Wanda, stating \"If everything goes according to plan, Wanda will indeed return to Young Avengers early in Season Two, when Billy and Tommy embark on a search for the true source of their powers.\" [57] Indeed, the Young Avengers Present issue from March 2008 involves the \"twin brothers\" Wiccan and Speed looking for their \"mother Wanda\" [58]\n\n\nAnalogy to the Arthurian legend\nSeveral comics showed stark similarities between Wiccan and Hulkling and the mythological figures Merlin and King Arthur Both Arthur (at least in one popular version of the legend) and Hulkling grew up unaware of their destiny Both are prophesiesed to unite their people and bring peace, have a strong wizard on their side, use magical swords and become the beloved kings of a big kingdom/empire.\n\n\nRelationships\nExchanges between Wiccan and Hulkling shows that the two teens are definitely lovers [63] Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship, [64] [65] and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly [63]\n\n\nOrigin of name\nAsked about Billy's codename, Heinberg said \"It turns out that code names are the trickiest part of creating new characters When Kate suggests 'Wiccan' to Billy in Young Avengers #6, she, like me, was not thinking in terms of the specific religious practice of Wicca, but rather attempting to find a suitable counterpart for the word 'witch.' It was certainly not my intention to offend anyone with 'Wiccan.' And since adopting the code name, rest assured Billy has been doing his Wiccan homework, so keep reading...\" During their time fighting the Mother, Loki eventually questions Wiccan about his codename He complains that since he is a pagan deity, he takes some offence to its use, and jokingly states that he has a list of better names [70]\n\n\nReception\nHeinberg reported that when the relationship between Wiccan and Hulkling was initially suspected before its confirmation, most fans were supportive, with minimal negative reaction [71] Wiccan and Hulkling have been called \"Marvel's most prominent gay couple,\" and received praise for showing diversity and progression in comics [72] [73] While accepting the Corporate Vanguard Award for Marvel Entertainment at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, Marvel's VP of Animation Development, Cort Lane, cited Wiccan and Hulkling's relationship as one of his favorite story lines featuring LGBT characters [74]\n\n\nCritical reception\nHeinberg

Mexico returned after missing the 1974 tournament For the first time, more than 100 nations entered the competition [7]\n\n\nList of teams qualifying\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\nControversy\nA controversy surrounding the 1978 World Cup was that Argentina had undergone a military coup of its democratic government only two years before the cup, which installed a dictatorship known as the National Reorganization Process Between the time that the military junta took over the government and the time the World Cup started, foreign journalists were concerned about how Argentinian newspaper reporters and editors were being treated by the regime, in attempting to get leftist members out of the picture The new government targeted any parts of society that they saw were trying to undermine them [4] Less than a year before the World Cup, in September 1977, Interior Minister General Albano Harguindeguy, stated that 5,618 people had recently disappeared The infamous Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy (known by its acronym ESMA) held concentration camp prisoners of the Dirty War and those held captive reportedly could hear the roars of the crowd during matches held at River Plate's Monumental Stadium, located only a mile away; [8] prompting echoes of Hitler's and Mussolini's alleged political manipulation of sports during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and 1934 FIFA World Cup [9] Also, the junta practiced censorship since it was established, which encouraged less reports on the real situation in Argentina This was done as an attempt to change the character of the Argentinian people [4]\n\n\nProtests\nAmnesty International announced their strategy for Argentina in 1978 After their awareness that urging people away from the World Cup could produce counter-sympathy for the junta, they launched a campaign that would teach journalists to write about the tournament but based on the regime, along with the slogan \"Football yes, torture no.\" They hoped that the journalists would turn their eyes away from the matches and look at what's going on in their society to educate their readers on the reality of Argentina [4] Paris was a center of unanimity for the victims of the Argentinian dictatorship, which launched a campaign to boycott the 1978 World Cup In the city, they made posters, publications or any kind of information that expressed opposition to the World Cup under a dictatorship The first calls to boycott were published in the daily Le Monde in October 1977 Later, a boycott committee was organized, which brought together human-rights militants and left-wing activists This organization came to be known as COBA, a French acronym for, \"Committee for the Boycott of the World Cup in Argentina.\" It wasn't long before the COBA had established a strong base of unity and protest throughout France, with more than 200 local COBA committees created in major cities and provinces  [16]\n\n\nArgentina v Peru\nFurther accusations have surrounded the game Argentina and Peru played in the second round of the tournament Following Brazil's 3–1 win over Poland, Argentina needed to win by a margin of four goals to proceed to the final and did so by defeating Peru by 6–0 There were allegations that the authoritarian Argentine military government interfered to ensure Argentina would defeat Peru through intimidation, though these were denied by Peruvian captain Héctor Chumpitaz and several Peruvian players [17] Some accusations originated in the Brazilian media and pointed to the fact that the Peruvian goalkeeper, Ramón Quiroga, had been born in Argentina [18] [19] There was also an alleged deal, reported by the British media as an anonymous rumour, that involved the delivery of a large grain shipment to Peru by Argentina and the unfreezing of a Peruvian bank account that was held by the Argentine Central Bank [20] Another alleged deal, published by a Colombian drug lord in a controversial book, involved the Peruvian team being bribed without any political implications [17] A third alleged deal, stated by a Peruvian leftist politician, encompassed sending 13 Peruvian dissidents exiled in Argentina back to Peru [21]\n\n\nFormat\nThe format of the competition stayed the same as in 1974: 16 teams qualified, divided into four groups of four Each group played a round-robin with two points for a win and one for a draw, and goal difference used to separate teams level on points The top two teams in each group would advance to the second round, where they would be split into two groups of four The winners of each group would play each other in the final, and the second-place finishers in the third place match.\n\n\nSummary\nThe first round produced several surprises Poland won Group 2 ahead of world champions West Germany, after holding the Germans to a goalless draw and then beating Tunisia and Mexico The Germans then beat Mexico 6–0, and finally played out a second goalless draw against Tunisia Although they failed to qualify for the second round, Tunisia made history by beating Mexico 3–1 while trailing 0–1 at half time It was the first time that any African team had won a match at the World Cup finals.\n\n\nFirst round\nThe first round produced several surprises Poland won Group 2 ahead of world champions West Germany, after holding the

Plata and Tucuman La Plata, the city of the diagonals, promised a \"one-of-a-kind stadium\" but by 1974 it was scrapped by internal bids The La Plata Stadium was finally completed in 2003 In the case of Tucuman, an ambitious stadium of 70,000 spectators had been promised in Horco Molle, similar to the current Racing Club Stadium, along with the roof The Tucuman venue was temporarily suspended in 1974 and was decommissioned the following year, given the intensity of the actions of the guerrillas and the Armed Forces in the province [24] Three new stadiums were built (Olympic Stadium in Córdoba; World Cup Stadium in Mar del Plata; and Mendoza City Stadium in Mendoza) and the other three were remodelled [6]\n\n\nMatch officials\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final

He was the brother of several other high-ranking members of the organization and was known for his involvement in the trafficking of cocaine into the United States. Arellano Félix's activities were the subject of significant attention from law enforcement agencies, including the United States Department of the Treasury, which sanctioned him under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act in 2000. He was eventually arrested by the Mexican Army in 2002.\n\n**Biography**\n\nBenjamín Arellano Félix was born in Mexico and grew up in a family with a strong involvement in organized crime. He was one of six brothers, all of whom were involved in the Tijuana Cartel. The Arellano Félix brothers were known for their ruthlessness and brutality, and they were responsible for a significant portion of the cocaine trafficking into the United States.\n\nBenjamín Arellano Félix worked closely with his brothers to build the Tijuana Cartel into one of the most powerful organizations in Mexico. He was a key figure in the organization's cocaine trafficking operations and was responsible for the supply of a significant portion of the cocaine that entered the United States.\n\nThe Arellano Félix brothers were known for their use of violence to maintain control over their territory and to eliminate rival organizations. They were responsible for numerous murders, kidnappings, and other violent crimes, and they were feared throughout Mexico and the United States.\n\n**Kingpin Act Sanction**\n\nOn June 1, 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Benjamín Arellano Félix under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. This act, also known as the \"Kingpin Act,\" prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing business with Arellano Félix and froze his assets in the United States.\n\nThe Kingpin Act was designed to target the leaders of international narcotics trafficking organizations and to disrupt their ability to operate in the United States. By sanctioning Arellano Félix, the U.S. government made it clear that it would not tolerate the involvement of Mexican cartels in the trafficking of narcotics into the United States.\n\nThe sanction had a significant impact on Arellano Félix's ability to operate in the United States. It made it difficult for him to obtain financing or to conduct business with U.S. companies, and it limited his ability to move assets into or out of the country.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nBenjamín Arellano Félix was arrested on March 9, 2002, by the Mexican Army in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The arrest was the result of a long investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Mexican authorities.\n\nThe DEA had been tracking Arellano Félix for several years, and they had identified a key vulnerability in his operation: his daughter. The daughter had a rare facial deformity, and the DEA believed that this made her a \"soft spot\" in her father's operation.\n\nBy tracing the daughter's movements, the DEA was able to locate Arellano Félix and coordinate with the Mexican Army to apprehend him. The arrest was a major blow to the Tijuana Cartel, and it marked the beginning of the end of Arellano Félix's reign as a major player in the international narcotics trade.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBenjamín Arellano Félix has been the subject of several books and documentaries, including a 2006 book by investigative journalist Charles Bowden titled \"Juárez: The Laboratory of Our Future.\" The book provides a detailed account of the rise and fall of the Tijuana Cartel and the role of Arellano Félix in its operations.\n\nIn 2011, a documentary film titled \"Cartel Land\" was released, which explores the impact of the Mexican cartels on the U.S.-Mexico border. The film features interviews with former members of the Tijuana Cartel, including some who worked closely with Arellano Félix.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Tijuana Cartel\n* Mexican drug war\n* Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act\n* United States Department of the Treasury\n\n**References**\n\n* Bowden, Charles.

a pair of Moon Shoes owned by American runner Mark Covert for an undisclosed amount in 2015 Prior to the 1972 Olympic Marathon Trials held in Eugene, Oregon, Covert entered an early Nike store to receive a free T-shirt and was given a pair of the Moon Shoes by Geoff Hollister, Nike's third employee The shoe featured an innovative \"waffle sole,\" designed by Bowerman, and was reportedly more comfortable than other running shoes at that time Covert was one of five runners to wear the Moon Shoe at the start of his race, but the only one to finish—giving him the distinction of being \"the first runner to ever cross a finish line in a pair of Nikes.\" Covert's shoes became highly collectible over the years, and he was finally convinced by Geller to sell them Nike had also approached Covert to purchase the shoes but purportedly offered him a lower price than Geller Geller revealed the shoes at an event at the Oregon Historical Society in 2016 [34] [35]\n\n\nMortenson's Moon Shoes\nGeller auctioned off a pair of Moon Shoes belonging to retired runner Bruce Mortenson for $11,200 in 2016 [36] Mortenson acquired the shoes during the 1972 Olympic Trials [37] Mortenson did not qualify for the team but kept the shoes and wore them in future races Mortenson decided to sell his shoes after hearing how fellow runner Mark Covert sold his Moon Shoes to Geller The shoes contained no laces, and the soles were crumbled According to Geller, the winner of the auction was an avid sneaker collector based in Malaysia [38]\n\n\nRussell's Moon Shoes\nSimilar to Mortenson, Dave Russell, a runner from Sacramento, was present at the 1972 Olympic Trials, where he was also given a pair of Moon Shoes Russell did not wear the Moon Shoes during his marathon run, and his shoes were in considerably better condition than Mortenson's, said Geller Initially, Geller was supposed to facilitate a 10-day eBay auction for Russell's shoes [39] However, a Nike-themed hotel located in Eugene, Oregon, contacted Russell to purchase his shoes privately Geller drove to Eugene in a DeLorean to personally deliver the shoes to the hotel where they were to be displayed [40] The hotel paid $50,000 for Russell's shoes [41] [42]\n\n\nSotheby's Moon Shoes\nIn 2019, Geller broke a world record for the most expensive sneaker sold at auction when he sold a pair of 1972 Moon Shoes at Sotheby's for $437,500 [43] [44] Sotheby's had joined with sneaker resale company Stadium Goods to auction off 100 pairs of rare sneakers [45] [46] Out of the twelve Moon Shoes in existence, Geller had the only known pair that have never been worn [47] [48] The shoes were expected to sell for $160,000 Miles Nadal, a Canadian investor and car collector, purchased the 99 other sneakers in the lot for $850,000 On the final day of the auction, Nadal won the bid for the Moon Shoes at a record-breaking $437,500 Nadal plans to display the shoes at his private car museum in Toronto [49] [50] [51]\n\n\nAir Jordan 1s\nOn May 17, 2020, [52] Geller broke his own record when his autographed, game-worn 1985 Air Jordan 1s sold at Sotheby's for $560,000 [53] [54] The shoes were in the Chicago Bulls colors of red, white, and black Like most of Jordan's shoes, the sneakers were mismatched: the left pair was a U.S size 13 while the right pair was a size 13.5 [55] [56] Geller acquired the sneakers in 2012 via an eBay auction, [57] [58] and referred to them as the \"crown jewel\" of the ShoeZeum [59] Ten bidders across four continents participated in the 10-day auction [60] The sale of the shoes coincided with the release of the ESPN documentary The Last Dance, which chronicled how the Chicago Bulls secured their sixth NBA championship during the 1997-1998 season [61] [62] The shoes sold for nearly four times their initial estimate Sotheby's did not release the identity of the buyer [63] [64]\n\n\nOther auctions\nIn 2009, Geller purchased the late DJ AM's personal pair of Air Force 1s for over $3,000 at auction, with the money benefiting the DJ AM Memorial Fund [65]\n\n\nSelling collection\nGeller had slowly started selling off his sneaker collection after closing the ShoeZeum in 2012 [75] In a 2014 YouTube video, Geller explained that part of the reason he was selling his shoes was due to the poor shelf life of the polyurethane, a squishy material commonly inserted between the upper and lower soles of sneakers The degradation of the polyurethane caused some of Geller's sneakers to yellow, and others were completely falling apart Geller was also frustrated that Nike kept \"retroing\" (i.e., re-releasing) classic sneaker models [26]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGeller met his wife, Natalie, at sneaker retailer Zappos Geller commented that \" [s]hoes are something that are deeply embedded in our relationship.\" [11] Nike designer Tinker Hatfield gifted Geller a custom pair of Air Jordan 11s for his wedding, which took place on 11/11 [79] [25] Geller has donated to the Doernbecher

The shoe is believed to be a prototype of the Nike Moon Shoe, the first shoe Nike made under their previous name, Blue Ribbon Sports. Wasson frequently visited Bowerman's home for meter readings. After Bowerman died in 1999, Wasson was asked by one of Bowerman's sons to help remove some trees from the property. While the two were working, they uncovered a buried trash pile that contained about a dozen shoes and a waffle iron (which was used to mold the soles of the shoes) in Bowerman's backyard. Bowerman's son allowed Wasson to keep one of the shoes where he stored it in his car for a few years. Wasson sold the shoe to Geller after a neighbor saw Geller featured on Pawn Stars. Geller framed the shoe over his fireplace.\n\n**Bowerman Buried Moon Shoe**\n\nIn 2014, Jeff Wasson, a utilities worker, sold an early prototype shoe that he found in Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman's backyard to Geller for $1,500. The shoe is believed to be a prototype of the Nike Moon Shoe, the first shoe Nike made under their previous name, Blue Ribbon Sports. Wasson frequently visited Bowerman's home for meter readings.

Geller framed the shoe over his fireplace.\n\n**Covert's Moon Shoes**\n\nGeller acquired a pair of Moon Shoes owned by American runner Mark Covert for an undisclosed amount in 2015. Prior to the 1972 Olympic Marathon Trials held in Eugene, Oregon, Covert entered an early Nike store to receive a free T-shirt and was given a pair of the Moon Shoes by Geoff Hollister, Nike's third employee. The shoe featured an innovative \"waffle sole,\" designed by Bowerman, and was reportedly more comfortable than other running shoes at that time. Covert was one of five runners to wear the Moon Shoe at the start of his race, but the only one to finish—giving him the distinction of being \"the first runner to ever cross a finish line in a pair of Nikes.\" Covert's shoes became highly collectible over the years, and he was finally convinced by Geller to sell them. Nike had also approached Covert to purchase the shoes but purportedly offered him a lower price than Geller. Geller revealed the shoes at an event at the Oregon Historical Society in 2016.\n\n**Mortenson's Moon Shoes**\n\nGeller auctioned off a pair of Moon Shoes belonging to retired runner Bruce Mortenson for $11,200 in 2016. Mortenson acquired the shoes during the 1972 Olympic Trials. Mortenson did not qualify for the team but kept the shoes and wore them in future races. Mortenson decided to sell his shoes after hearing how fellow runner Mark Covert sold his Moon Shoes to Geller. The shoes contained no laces, and the soles were crumbled. According to Geller, the winner of the auction was an avid sneaker collector based in Malaysia.\n\n**Russell's Moon Shoes**\n\nSimilar to Mortenson, Dave Russell, a runner from Sacramento, was present at the 1972 Olympic Trials, where he was also given a pair of Moon Shoes. Russell did not wear the Moon Shoes during his marathon run, and his shoes were in considerably better condition than Mortenson's, said Geller. Initially, Geller was supposed to facilitate a 10-day eBay auction for Russell's shoes. However, a Nike-themed hotel located in Eugene, Oregon, contacted Russell to purchase his shoes privately. Geller drove to Eugene in a DeLorean to personally deliver the shoes to the hotel where they were to be displayed. The hotel paid $50,000 for Russell's shoes.\n\n**Sotheby's Moon Shoes**\n\nIn 2019, Geller broke a world record for the most expensive sneaker sold at auction when he sold a pair of 1972 Moon Shoes at Sotheby's for $437,500. Sotheby's had joined with sneaker resale company Stadium Goods to auction off 100 pairs of rare sneakers. Out of the twelve Moon Shoes in existence, Geller had the only known pair that have never been worn. The shoes were expected to sell for $160,000. Miles Nadal, a Canadian investor and car collector, purchased the 99 other sneakers in the lot for $850,000. On the final day of the auction, Nadal won the bid for the Moon Shoes at a record-breaking $437,500. Nadal plans to display the shoes at his private car museum in Toronto.\n\n**Air Jordan 1s**\n\nOn May 17, 2020, Geller broke his own record when his autographed, game-worn 1985 Air Jordan 1s sold at Sotheby's for $560,000. The shoes were in the Chicago Bulls colors of red, white, and black. Like most of Jordan's shoes, the sneakers were mismatched: the left pair was a U.S size 13 while the right pair was a size 13.5. Geller acquired the sneakers in 2012 via an eBay auction, and referred to them as the \"crown jewel\" of the ShoeZeum. Ten bidders across four continents participated in the 10-day auction. The sale of the shoes coincided with the release of the ESPN documentary The Last Dance, which chronicled how the Chicago Bulls secured their sixth NBA championship during the 1997-1998 season. The shoes sold for nearly four times their initial estimate. Sotheby's did not release the identity of the buyer.\n\n**Other Auctions**\n\nIn 2009, Geller purchased the late DJ AM's personal pair of Air Force 1s for over $3,000 at auction, with the money benefiting the DJ AM Memorial Fund.\n\n**Selling Collection**\n\nGeller had slowly started selling off his sneaker collection after closing the ShoeZeum in 2012. In a 2014 YouTube video, Geller explained that part of the reason he was selling his shoes was due to the poor shelf life of the polyurethane, a squishy material commonly inserted between the upper and lower soles of sneakers. The degradation of the polyurethane caused some of Geller's sneakers to yellow, and others were completely falling apart. Geller was also frustrated that Nike kept \"retroing\" (i.e., re-releasing) classic sneaker models.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGeller met his wife, Natalie, at sneaker retailer Zappos. Geller commented that \"shoes are something that are deeply embedded in our relationship.\" Nike designer Tinker Hatfield gifted Geller a custom pair of Air Jordan 11s for his wedding, which took place on 11/11. Geller has donated to the Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, which has an ongoing partnership with Nike.\n\n**See Also**\n\n**Notes**\n\n**References**\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n**External Links**\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive biography of Jordan Geller, a renowned sneaker collector and businessman.

The two then wrote a manifesto Liberation Through Radical Decentralization, where they highlighted the common ground between Buterin's work on cryptocurrencies and Weyl's work on market-based solutions to social problems. Collaborating with Zoe Hitzig, a PhD student at Harvard, they published a paper in 2019 entitled A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods. The paper sets out a method for optimal provision of public goods, using a version of quadratic voting. As of August 2022, quadratic funding had been used to allocate over $20 million to open-source software projects, primarily through Gitcoin Grants.\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nButerin has received numerous awards and recognition for his work on Ethereum and cryptocurrency. He has been named one of the most influential people in the world by TIME magazine and has received the Thiel Fellowship, among other honors.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nButerin has been active in philanthropy, particularly in the area of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. He has donated to various charitable causes, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\n## Philanthropic Efforts against the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nButerin spoke out in support of Ukraine amid its invasion by Russia in 2022. On the first day of the invasion, Buterin tweeted that \"Ethereum is neutral, but I am not,\" and that the attack was a crime against both the Ukrainian and the Russian peoples.

He is also a war veteran and a member of the British royal family through his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n**Early Life, Education, and Military Career**\n\nLord Spencer was born Edward John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, on January 24, 1924, in the family home at 24 Sussex Square, Bayswater, London. He was the only son and younger child of Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, and his wife, the former Lady Cynthia Hamilton, second daughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn.\n\nSpencer was educated at Eton, a prestigious boarding school in England, where he developed a strong interest in history and the military. He later attended the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, where he graduated with honors. In 1944, he served as a captain in the Royal Scots Greys, a British Army cavalry regiment, and was Mentioned in Dispatches for his bravery in action.\n\nSpencer's military career took him to France, where he landed on June 6, 1944, the day after D-Day. He led a British Army unit in an operation to liberate two French towns, La Neuve-Lyre and La Vieille-Lyre. This military campaign was a significant contribution to the Allied victory in World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Spencer served as Aide-de-Camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia, from 1947 to 1950. This position gave him valuable experience in government and administration.\n\n**Family Life**\n\nOn June 1, 1954, Spencer married the Hon. Frances Ruth Roche, the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy, in Westminster Abbey. The wedding ceremony was attended by Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family.\n\nThe couple had five children:\n\n1. Sarah McCorquodale (born 1961)\n2. Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes (born 1962)\n3. Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer (born 1964)\n4. Catherine Elize Spencer (born 1965)\n5. John Spencer (born 1967)\n\nSpencer's marriage to Frances Roche was a long and happy one, lasting until her death in 2004. He has been a devoted father to their five children and has played an active role in their lives.\n\n**Coat of Arms**\n\nThe Spencer family coat of arms features a shield with three vertical stripes of blue, gold, and red. The shield is supported by two lions and surmounted by a helmet with a gold plume. The motto of the family is \"Aut nunquam tentes, aut perfice\" or \"Either do not attempt, or complete.\"\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nThe Spencer family has a long and noble history, dating back to the 15th century. The family's ancestors were prominent in English politics and society, and have been associated with several notable historical figures, including King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nJohn Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, is a direct descendant of King Charles II of England and has a significant amount of royal blood in his veins. Through his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, he became a member of the British royal family and played an important role in promoting the Spencer family's interests and traditions.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations, as the information presented is based on publicly available sources and is not subject to copyright.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Spencer family website\n* Royal Family website\n* British History website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Spencer,_8th_Earl_Spencer\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life, education and military career\nLord Spencer was born Edward John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, the only son and younger child of Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, and his wife the former Lady Cynthia Hamilton, second daughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn He was born on 24 January 1924 in their family home at 24 Sussex Square, Bayswater, London [1] He was educated at Eton, the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and the Royal Agricultural College Popularly known to his family and friends as Johnnie Althorp, he served as a captain in the Royal Scots Greys from 1944 to 1945, [2] and was Mentioned in Dispatches He landed in France the day after D-Day He led a British Army unit in an operation to liberate two French towns, La Neuve-Lyre and La Vieille-Lyre [3] [4] [5] From 1947 to 1950, he served as Aide-de-Camp to His Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir Willoughby Norrie, then Governor of South Australia [2]\n\n\nFamily life\nOn 1 June 1954 Spencer and the Hon Frances Ruth Roche, the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy, were married in Westminster Abbey by Percy Herbert, Bishop of Norwich Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family attended the wedding ceremony [13] They had five children:\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

security of the Russian Stavka [12]\n\n\nCollapse of the USSR\nOn the basis of the ex-Soviet Air Forces formations in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force, as a service branch of the young Armed Forces, was established on 17 March 1992, in accordance with a Directive of the Chief of the General Staff of the AFU The headquarters of the 24th Air Army of the Soviet Air Force in Vinnytsia served as the basis to create the Air Force headquarters Also present on Ukrainian soil were units of the former Soviet 5th, 14th, and 17th Air Armies, plus five regiments (185th, 251st, 260th, 341st Heavy Bomber

{"title": "World_War_I", "content": "\nNames\nBefore World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War [1] In August 1914, the magazine The Independent wrote \"This is the Great War It names itself\" [2] In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, \"Some wars name themselves This is the Great War.\" [3] Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life [4] The first recorded use of the term First World War was in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel who stated, \"There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' .. will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.\" [5]\n\n\nBackground\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe [6] After 1848, this was challenged by Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck Victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire Post-1871, the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat, [7] but by the early 1890s, this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire [8]\n\n\nPolitical and military alliances\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe [6] After 1848, this was challenged by Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck Victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire Post-1871, the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat, [7] but by the early 1890s, this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire [8]\n\n\nArms race\nGerman economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post-1871 Backed by Wilhelm II, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an Imperial German Navy, that could compete with the British Royal Navy [14] This policy was based on the work of US naval author Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued that possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel [15]\n\n\nConflicts in the Balkans\nThe years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans, as other powers sought to benefit from the Ottoman decline While Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russia considered itself the protector of Serbia and other Slav states, they preferred the strategically vital Bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government, rather than an ambitious Slav power like Bulgaria Russia had ambitions in northeastern Anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the Balkans These competing interests divided Russian policy-makers and added to regional instability [20]\n\n\nPrelude\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović (Bosnian Serbs) and Muhamed Mehmedbašić (from the Bosniaks community), [33] from the movement known as Young Bosnia, took up positions along the Archduke's motorcade route, to assassinate him Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule [34]\n\n\nSarajevo assassination\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović (Bosnian Serbs) and Muhamed Mehmedbašić (from the Bosniaks community), [33] from the movement known as Young Bosnia, took up positions along the Archduke's motorcade route, to assassinate him Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule [34]\n\n\nExpansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nAustro-Hungarian authorities encouraged subsequent anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo [38] [39] Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison A further 460 Serbs were sentenced to death A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the Schutzkorps was established, and carried out the persecution of Serbs [40] [41] [42] [43]\n\n\nJuly Crisis\nThe assassination initiated the July Crisis, a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain Believing that Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz Ferdinand's murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this [44] However, the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof of Serbian involvement [45] On 23 July, Austria delivered an ultimatum to Serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities [46]\n\n\nProgress of the war\nGermany promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia [60]\n\n\nOpening hostilities\nGermany promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia [60]\n\n\nConfusion among the Central Powers\nGermany promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia [60]\n\n\nSerbian campaign\nBeginning on 12 August, the Austrians and Serbs clashed at the battles of the Cer and Kolubara; over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening their efforts against Russia [61] Serbia's victory against Austria-Hungary in the 1914 invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century [62] In 1915, the campaign saw the first use of anti-aircraft warfare after an Austrian plane was shot down with ground-to-air fire, as well as the first medical evacuation by the Serbian army [63] [64]\n\n\nGerman offensive in Belgium and France\nUpon mobilisation, in accordance with the Schlieffen Plan, 80% of the German Army was located on the Western Front, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East Rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier, the German right wing would sweep through the Netherlands and Belgium, then swing south, encircling Paris and trapping the French army against the Swiss border The plan's creator, Alfred von Schlieffen, head of the German General Staff from 1891 to 1906, estimated that this would take six weeks, after which the German army would transfer to the East and defeat the Russians [65]\n\n\nAsia and the Pacific\nOn 30 August 1914, New Zealand occupied German Samoa (now Samoa) On 11 September, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island of New Britain, then part of German New Guinea On 28 October, the German cruiser SMS Emden sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug in the Battle of Penang Japan declared war on Germany before seizing territories in the Pacific, which later became the South Seas Mandate, as well as German Treaty ports on the Chinese Shandong peninsula at Tsingtao After Vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth from Tsingtao, Japan declared war on Austria-Hungary, and the ship was sunk in November 1914 [74] Within a few months, Allied forces had seized all German territories in the Pacific, leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea [75] [76]\n\n\nAfrican campaigns\nSome of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa On 6–7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorates of Togoland and Kamerun On 10 August, German forces in South-West Africa attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war The German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe [77]\n\n\nIndian support for the Allies\nBefore the war, Germany had attempted to use Indian nationalism and pan-Islamism to its advantage, a policy continued post-1914 by instigating uprisings in India, while the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity [78] [79] Leaders from the Indian National Congress and other groups believed support for the British war effort would hasten Indian Home Rule, a promise allegedly made explicit in 1917 by Edwin Montagu, the Secretary of State for India [80]\n\n\nWestern Front 1914 to 1916\nPre-war military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in 1914 Technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances, such as barbed wire, machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult [83] Both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties In time, technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank [84]\n\n\nTrench warfare begins\nPre-war military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted

without heavy casualties In time, technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank [84]\n\n\nContinuation of trench warfare\nIn February 1916, the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916 Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 [89] to 975,000 [90] casualties between the two combatants Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice [91]\n\n\nNaval war\nAt the start of the war, German cruisers were scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping These were systematically hunted down by the Royal Navy, though not before causing considerable damage One of the most successful was the SMS Emden, part of the German East Asia Squadron stationed at Qingdao, which seized or sank 15 merchantmen, a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer Most of the squadron was returning to Germany when it sank two British armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, before being virtually destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December The SMS Dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries, but after the Battle of Más a Tierra, these too were either destroyed or interned [94]\n\n\nSouthern theatres\nFaced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, Belgrade A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914 For the first 10 months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia [106] The Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria-Hungary Montenegro allied itself with Serbia [107]\n\n\nWar in the Balkans\nFaced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia After suffering heavy losses,

Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria-Hungary Montenegro allied itself with Serbia [107]\n\n\nOttoman Empire\nThe Ottomans threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's communications with India via the Suez Canal The Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Christian populations—the Armenian genocide, Greek genocide, and Sayfo respectively [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nItalian Front\nThough Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882, a treaty with its traditional Austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in 1915 [128] This arose from nationalist designs on Austro-Hungarian territory in Trentino, the Austrian Littoral, Rijeka and Dalmatia, considered vital to secure the borders established in 1866 [129] In 1902, Rome secretly had agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany, effectively nullifying its role in the Triple Alliance [130]\n\n\nEastern Front\nAs previously agreed with French president Raymond Poincaré, Russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into Austrian Galicia and East Prussia as soon as possible Although their attack on Galicia was largely successful, and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing Germany to divert troops from the Western Front, the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions These weaknesses contributed to Russian defeats at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914, forcing them to withdraw from East Prussia with heavy losses [143] [144] By spring 1915, they had also retreated from Galicia, and the May 1915 Gorlice–Tarnów offensive allowed the Central Powers to invade Russian-occupied Poland [145]\n\n\nInitial actions\nAs

Prussia with heavy losses [143] [144] By spring 1915, they had also retreated from Galicia, and the May 1915 Gorlice–Tarnów offensive allowed the Central Powers to invade Russian-occupied Poland [145]\n\n\nRomanian participation\nDespite secretly agreeing to support the Triple Alliance in 1883, Romania increasingly found itself at odds with the Central Powers over their support for Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and the status of ethnic Romanian communities in Hungarian-controlled Transylvania, [149] which comprised an estimated 2.8 million of the 5.0 million population [150] With the ruling elite split into pro-German and pro-Entente factions, [151] Romania remained neutral for two years while allowing Germany and Austria to transport military supplies and advisors across Romanian territory [152]\n\n\nCentral Powers peace overtures\nOn 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a successful offensive against Romania, Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies [160] However, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a \"duplicitous war ruse\" [160]\n\n\nFinal years of the war\nBy the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in Petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds [163] Revolutionaries set up the Petrograd Soviet and fearing a left-wing takeover, the State Duma forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the Russian Provisional Government, which confirmed Russia's willingness to continue the war However, the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband, creating competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised [164]\n\n\nRussian Revolution and withdrawal\nBy the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in Petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds [163] Revolutionaries set up the Petrograd Soviet and fearing a left-wing takeover, the State Duma forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the Russian Provisional Government, which confirmed Russia's willingness to continue the war However, the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband, creating competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised [164]\n\n\nUnited States enters the war\nThe United States was a major supplier of war material to the Allies but remained neutral in 1914, in large part due to domestic opposition [168] The most significant factor in creating the support Wilson needed was the German submarine offensive, which not only cost American lives but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea [169]\n\n\nNivelle Offensive (April–May 1917)\nIn December 1916, Robert Nivelle replaced Pétain as commander of French armies on the Western Front and began planning a spring attack in Champagne, part of a joint Franco-British operation [175] Poor security meant German intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables, but despite this, when the attack began on 16 April the French made substantial gains, before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the Hindenburg Line Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and, by 25 April, the French had suffered nearly 135,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, most incurred in the first two days [176]\n\n\nSinai and Palestine campaign (1917–1918)\nIn March and April 1917, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza, German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which had begun in August 1916 at the Battle of Romani [181] [182] At the end of October 1917, the Sinai and Palestine campaign resumed, when General Edmund Allenby's XXth Corps, XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps won the Battle of Beersheba [183] Two Ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the Battle of Mughar Ridge and, early in December, Jerusalem had been captured following another Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Jerusalem [184] [185] [186] About this time, Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the Eighth Army's commander, replaced by Djevad Pasha, and a few months later the commander of the Ottoman Army in Palestine, Erich von Falkenhayn, was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders [187] [188]\n\n\nGerman offensive and Allied counter-offensive (March–November 1918)\nIn December 1917, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the West With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success in a final quick offensive [191] Ludendorff drew up plans (Operation Michael) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front The operation commenced on 21 March 1918, with an attack on British forces near Saint-Quentin German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (37 mi) [192] The initial offensive was a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted Lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic [193]\nGermany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany The German Army to the south then conducted Operations Blücher and Yorck, pushing broadly towards Paris Germany launched Operation Marne (Second Battle of the Marne) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle Reims The resulting counter-attack, which started the Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August, [194] led to a marked collapse in German morale [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nAllied advance to the Hindenburg Line\nBy September, the Germans had fallen back to the Hindenburg Line The Allies had advanced to the Hindenburg Line in the north and centre German forces launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the Line continued falling, with the BEF alone taking 30,441 prisoners in the last week of September On 24 September, the Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable [198]\n\n\nBreakthrough of Macedonian front (September 1918)\nAllied forces started the Vardar offensive on 15 September at two key points: Dobro Pole and near Dojran Lake In the Battle of Dobro Pole, the Serbian and French armies had success after a three-day-long battle with relatively small casualties, and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front, something which was rarely seen in World War I After the front was broken, Allied forces started to liberate Serbia and reached Skopje at 29 September, after which Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September [201] [202]\n\n\nArmistices and capitulations\nThe collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September 1918 [203] German Emperor Wilhelm II in a telegram to Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I described the situation thus: \"Disgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!\" [204] [205] On the same day, the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless [206]\n\n\nGerman government surrenders\nWith the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge on October 3 as Chancellor of Germany Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military [209]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn the aftermath of the war, the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires disappeared [f] Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created Four dynasties fell as a result of the war: the Romanovs, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburgs, and the Ottomans Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4 million soldiers dead, [215] not counting other casualties Germany and Russia were similarly affected [216]\n\n\nFormal end of the war\nA formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919 The US Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it, [217] [218] and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the Knox–Porter Resolution was signed on 2 July 1921 by President Warren G Harding [219] For the British Empire, the state of war ceased under the provisions of the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918 concerning:\n\n\nPeace treaties and national boundaries\nThe Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on Wilson's 14th point, established the League of Nations on 28 June 1919 [226] [227]\n\n\nNational identities\nAfter 123 years, Poland re-emerged as an independent country The Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty, as a \"minor Entente nation\" and the country with the most casualties per capita, [236] [237] [238] became the backbone of a new multinational state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia Czechoslovakia, combining the Kingdom of Bohemia with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, became a new nation Romania would unite all Romanian-speaking people under a single state, leading to Greater Romania [239]\n\n\nCasualties\nOf the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, an estimated 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5% [245] France mobilised 7.8 million men, of which 1.4 million died and 3.2 million were injured [246] Approximately 15,000 deployed men sustained gruesome facial injuries, causing social stigma and marginalisation; they were called the gueules cassées (broken faces) In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that had weakened disease resistance These excess deaths are estimated as 271,000 in 1918, plus another 71,000 in the first half of 1919 when the blockade was still in effect [247] Starvation caused by famine killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon [248]\n\n\nWar crimes\nThe German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (April–May 1915), after German scientists under the direction of Fritz Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine [g] [257] The use of chemical weapons had been sanctioned by the German High Command to force Allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons [257] Chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately 1.3 million casualties, of which about 90,000 were fatal [257] The use of chemical weapons in warfare was a direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use [258] [259]\n\n\nChemical weapons in warfare\nThe German

Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use [258] [259]\n\n\nGenocides by the Ottoman Empire\nThe ethnic cleansing of the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population, including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide [261] The Ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination [262] In early 1915, several Armenians volunteered to join the Russian forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the Tehcir Law (Law on Deportation), which authorised the deportation of Armenians from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and 1918 The Armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands [263] While the exact number of deaths is unknown, the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates around 1.5 million [261] [264] The government of Turkey continues to deny the genocide to the present day, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians [265]\n\n\nPrisoners of war\nAbout 8 million soldiers surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front [270]\n\n\nSoldiers' experiences\nAllied personnel was around 42,928,000, while Central personnel was near 25,248,000 [216] [272] British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but were increasingly conscripted Surviving veterans returning home often found they could discuss their experiences only among themselves, so formed \"veterans' associations\" or \"Legions\".\n\n\nConscription\nConscription was common in most European countries However, it was controversial in English-speaking countries, [273] It was especially unpopular among minority ethnicities—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland, [274] Australia, [275] [276] and the French Catholics in Canada [277] [278]\n\n\nMilitary attachés and war correspondents\nMilitary and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war [281] Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern \"embedded\" positions within the opposing land and naval forces [282] [283]\n\n\nEconomic effects\n\nMacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war Families were altered by the departure of many men With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers At the same time, the industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war This aided the struggle for voting rights for women [284]\n\nSupport and opposition for the war\nIn the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, Ante Trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia The Yugoslav Committee, led by Trumbić, was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London [298] In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including Czechoslovak, Italian, Polish, Transylvanian, and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to support national self-determination for the peoples residing within Austria-Hungary [299]\n\n\nSupport\nIn the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, Ante Trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from

national self-determination for the peoples residing within Austria-Hungary [299]\n\n\nPatriotic funds\nOn both sides, there was large-scale fundraising for soldiers' welfare, their dependents and those injured The Nail Men were a German example Around the British Empire, there were many patriotic funds, including the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation, Canadian Patriotic Fund, Queensland Patriotic Fund and, by 1919, there were 983 funds in New Zealand [311] At the start of the next world war the New Zealand funds were reformed, having been criticised as overlapping, wasteful and abused, [312] but 11 were still functioning in 2002 [313]\n\n\nOpposition\n\nMany countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict These included Eugene Debs in the US and Bertrand Russell in Britain In the US, the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed \"disloyal\" Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors, [314] and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.\n\nTechnology\nWorld War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties By the end of 1917, however, the major armies had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, [324] armoured cars, tanks (especially with the advent of the prototype tank, Little Willie), and aircraft [325]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs In addition, multiple peace proposals were coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far [329] [330] [331]\n\n\nLegacy and memory\nMemorials were built in thousands of villages and towns Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the German War Graves Commission, and Le Souvenir français Many of these graveyards also have monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme [332] [333]\n\n\nMemorials\nMemorials were built in thousands of villages and towns Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually

[333]\n\n\nHistoriography\n... \"Strange, friend,\" I said, \"Here is no cause to mourn.\"\n\"None,\" said the other, \"Save the undone years\"... \n\n\nUnexploded ordnance\nAs late as 2007, unexploded ordnance at battlefield sites like Verdun and Somme continued to pose a danger In France and Belgium, locals who discover caches of unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units In some places, plant life has still not recovered from the effects of the war [341]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nLibrary guides\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "World War I\n\nThe First World War, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It was one of the deadliest wars in history, with over 37 million casualties, including both military and civilian losses.\n\n**Names**\n\nBefore World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War. In August 1914, the magazine The Independent wrote \"This is the Great War It names itself.\" In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, \"Some wars name themselves This is the Great War.\" Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life. The first recorded use of the term First World War was in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel who stated, \"There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' .. will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.\"\n\n**Background**\n\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe. After 1848, this was challenged by Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck. Victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire. Post-1871, the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat, but by the early 1890s, this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire.\n\n**Political and military alliances**\n\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe. In 1882, Italy joined the Triple Alliance, a treaty with Austria-Hungary and Germany, which effectively nullified its role in the Concert of Europe. In 1902, Rome secretly had agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany, effectively nullifying its role in the Triple Alliance. The Entente Cordiale of 1904 between Britain and France, and the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, effectively ended the isolation of France and led to the formation of the Triple Entente, with the United States remaining neutral.\n\n**Arms race**\n\nGerman economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post-1871. Backed by Wilhelm II, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an Imperial German Navy, that could compete with the British Royal Navy. This policy was based on the work of US naval author Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued that possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel.\n\n**Conflicts in the Balkans**\n\nThe years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans, as other powers sought to benefit from the Ottoman decline. While Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russia considered itself the protector of Serbia and other Slav states, they preferred the strategically vital Bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government, rather than an ambitious Slav power like Bulgaria. Russia had ambitions in northeastern Anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the Balkans. These competing interests divided Russian policy-makers and added to regional instability.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović (Bosnian Serbs) and Muhamed Mehmedbašić (from the Bosniaks community), from the movement known as Young Bosnia, took up positions along the Archduke's motorcade route, to assassinate him. Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule.\n\n**Sarajevo assassination**\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović (Bosnian Serbs) and Muhamed Mehmedbašić (from the Bosniaks community), from the movement known as Young Bosnia, took up positions along the Archduke's motorcade route, to assassinate him. Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule.\n\n**Expansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina**\n\nAustro-Hungarian authorities encouraged subsequent anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo. Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia. Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the Schutzkorps was established, and carried out the persecution of Serbs.\n\n**July Crisis**\n\nThe assassination initiated the July Crisis, a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain. Believing that Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz Ferdinand's murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this. However, the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof of Serbian involvement. On 23 July, Austria delivered an ultimatum to Serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities.\n\n**Progress of the war**\n\nBy the end of 1914, the war had spread to several continents and involved many of the great powers of Europe. The war began in Europe but soon spread to other parts of the world, including Africa, Asia and the Pacific. The Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria, were pitted against the Allied Powers, which included France, Britain, Russia, the United States and Italy.\n\n**Italian Front**\n\nAlthough Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882, a treaty with Austria-Hungary and Germany, it remained neutral until 1915. In 1915, Italy switched sides and joined the Allies, declaring war on Austria-Hungary. The Italian front was marked by a series of bloody battles, including the Battle of Caporetto, which resulted in the defeat of the Italian army.\n\n**Eastern Front**\n\nThe Eastern Front saw the German army clash with the Russian army, resulting in a series of bloody battles, including the Battle of Tannenberg and the Battle of the Masurian Lakes. The German army eventually defeated the Russian army, but at great cost.\n\n**Western Front**\n\nThe Western Front saw the German army clash with the French army, resulting in a series of bloody battles, including the Battle of the Marne and the Battle of Verdun. The war of attrition continued until the German army launched a final assault on the Allied army in 1918.\n\n**United States enters the war**\n\nThe United States initially remained neutral in the conflict, but eventually entered the war in 1917 after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and sank several American ships. The entry of the United States into the war marked a significant turning point in the conflict, as it provided the Allies with a much-needed boost in manpower and resources.\n\n**Armistice and Treaty of Versailles**\n\nThe war ended on November 11, 1918, with the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 28, 1919, officially ending the war. The treaty imposed harsh penalties on Germany, including significant territorial losses and reparations. The treaty also established the League of Nations, an international organization dedicated to promoting peace and preventing future wars.\n\n**Casualties and after effects**\n\nThe war resulted in the deaths of an estimated 37 million people, including both military and civilian losses. The war also had a profound impact on the world, leading to the fall of several empires, including the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman empires. The war also led to the rise of new world powers, including the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe legacy of World War I continues to be felt today. The war marked a significant turning point in world history, leading to the rise of new world powers and the fall of several empires. The war also led to the establishment of the League of Nations, an international organization dedicated to promoting peace and preventing future wars. The war also had a profound impact on the world, leading to significant changes in the global balance of power and the rise of new ideologies, including fascism and communism.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWorld War I was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. The war was fought between the Allied Powers, which included France, Britain, Russia, the United States and Italy, and the Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. The war resulted in the deaths of an estimated 37 million people, including both military and civilian losses. The war also had a profound impact on the world, leading to the fall of several empires, including the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman empires. The war also led to the rise of new world powers, including the United States and the Soviet Union.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"World_War_I\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames\nBefore World War II, the events of 1914–1918 were generally known as the Great War or simply the World War [1] In August 1914, the magazine The Independent wrote \"This is the Great War It names itself\" [2] In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's similarly wrote, \"Some wars name themselves This is the Great War.\" [3] Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as \"the war to end war\" and it was also described as \"the war to end all wars\" due to their perception of its unparalleled scale, devastation, and loss of life [4] The first recorded use of the term First World War was in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel who stated, \"There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' .. will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.\" [5]\n\n\nBackground\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe [6] After 1848, this was challenged by Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck Victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire Post-1871, the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat, [7] but by the early 1890s, this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire [8]\n\n\nPolitical and military alliances\nFor much of the 19th century, the major European powers maintained a tenuous balance of power, known as the Concert of Europe [6] After 1848, this was challenged by Britain's withdrawal into so-called splendid isolation, the decline of the Ottoman Empire, New Imperialism, and the rise of Prussia under Otto von Bismarck Victory in the 1870–1871 Franco-Prussian War allowed Bismarck to consolidate a German Empire Post-1871, the primary aim of French policy was to avenge this defeat, [7] but by the early 1890s, this had switched to the expansion of the French colonial empire [8]\n\n\nArms race\nGerman economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post-1871 Backed by Wilhelm II, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an Imperial German Navy, that could compete with the British Royal Navy [14] This policy was based on the work of US naval author Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued that possession of a blue-water navy was vital for global power projection; Tirpitz had his books translated into German, while Wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel [15]\n\n\nConflicts in the Balkans\nThe years before 1914 were marked by a series of crises in the Balkans, as other powers sought to benefit from the Ottoman decline While Pan-Slavic and Orthodox Russia considered itself the protector of Serbia and other Slav states, they preferred the strategically vital Bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak Ottoman government, rather than an ambitious Slav power like Bulgaria Russia had ambitions in northeastern Anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the Balkans These competing interests divided Russian policy-makers and added to regional instability [20]\n\n\nPrelude\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović (Bosnian Serbs) and Muhamed Mehmedbašić (from the Bosniaks community), [33] from the movement known as Young Bosnia, took up positions along the Archduke's motorcade route, to assassinate him Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule [34]\n\n\nSarajevo assassination\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, visited Sarajevo, the capital of the recently annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović (Bosnian Serbs) and Muhamed Mehmedbašić (from the Bosniaks community), [33] from the movement known as Young Bosnia, took up positions along the Archduke's motorcade route, to assassinate him Supplied with arms by extremists within the Serbian Black Hand intelligence organisation, they hoped his death would free Bosnia from Austrian rule [34]\n\n\nExpansion of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina\nAustro-Hungarian authorities encouraged subsequent anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo [38] [39] Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were also organised outside Sarajevo, in other cities in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison A further 460 Serbs were sentenced to death A predominantly Bosniak special militia known as the Schutzkorps was established, and carried out the persecution of Serbs [40] [41] [42] [43]\n\n\nJuly Crisis\nThe assassination initiated the July Crisis, a month of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain Believing that Serbian intelligence helped organise Franz Ferdinand's murder, Austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end their interference in Bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this [44] However, the Foreign Ministry had no solid proof of Serbian involvement [45] On 23 July, Austria delivered an ultimatum to Serbia, listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities [46]\n\n\nProgress of the war\nGermany promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia [60]\n\n\nOpening hostilities\nGermany promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia [60]\n\n\nConfusion among the Central Powers\nGermany promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but those had never been tested in exercises Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia [60]\n\n\nSerbian campaign\nBeginning on 12 August, the Austrians and Serbs clashed at the battles of the Cer and Kolubara; over the next two weeks, Austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening their efforts against Russia [61] Serbia's victory against Austria-Hungary in the 1914 invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century [62] In 1915, the campaign saw the first use of anti-aircraft warfare after an Austrian plane was shot down with ground-to-air fire, as well as the first medical evacuation by the Serbian army [63] [64]\n\n\nGerman offensive in Belgium and France\nUpon mobilisation, in accordance with the Schlieffen Plan, 80% of the German Army was located on the Western Front, with the remainder acting as a screening force in the East Rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier, the German right wing would sweep through the Netherlands and Belgium, then swing south, encircling Paris and trapping the French army against the Swiss border The plan's creator, Alfred von Schlieffen, head of the German General Staff from 1891 to 1906, estimated that this would take six weeks, after which the German army would transfer to the East and defeat the Russians [65]\n\n\nAsia and the Pacific\nOn 30 August 1914, New Zealand occupied German Samoa (now Samoa) On 11 September, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force landed on the island of New Britain, then part of German New Guinea On 28 October, the German cruiser SMS Emden sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug in the Battle of Penang Japan declared war on Germany before seizing territories in the Pacific, which later became the South Seas Mandate, as well as German Treaty ports on the Chinese Shandong peninsula at Tsingtao After Vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth from Tsingtao, Japan declared war on Austria-Hungary, and the ship was sunk in November 1914 [74] Within a few months, Allied forces had seized all German territories in the Pacific, leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea [75] [76]\n\n\nAfrican campaigns\nSome of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa On 6–7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorates of Togoland and Kamerun On 10 August, German forces in South-West Africa attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war The German colonial forces in German East Africa, led by Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, fought a guerrilla warfare campaign and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe [77]\n\n\nIndian support for the Allies\nBefore the war, Germany had attempted to use Indian nationalism and pan-Islamism to its advantage, a policy continued post-1914 by instigating uprisings in India, while the Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition urged Afghanistan to join the war on the side of Central Powers However, contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity [78] [79] Leaders from the Indian National Congress and other groups believed support for the British war effort would hasten Indian Home Rule, a promise allegedly made explicit in 1917 by Edwin Montagu, the Secretary of State for India [80]\n\n\nWestern Front 1914 to 1916\nPre-war military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in 1914 Technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances, such as barbed wire, machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult [83] Both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties In time, technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank [84]\n\n\nTrench warfare begins\nPre-war military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in 1914 Technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances, such as barbed wire, machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery, which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult [83] Both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties In time, technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank [84]\n\n\nContinuation of trench warfare\nIn February 1916, the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916 Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 [89] to 975,000 [90] casualties between the two combatants Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice [91]\n\n\nNaval war\nAt the start of the war, German cruisers were scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping These were systematically hunted down by the Royal Navy, though not before causing considerable damage One of the most successful was the SMS Emden, part of the German East Asia Squadron stationed at Qingdao, which seized or sank 15 merchantmen, a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer Most of the squadron was returning to Germany when it sank two British armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, before being virtually destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December The SMS Dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries, but after the Battle of Más a Tierra, these too were either destroyed or interned [94]\n\n\nSouthern theatres\nFaced with Russia in the east, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, Belgrade A Serbian counter-attack in the Battle of Kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914 For the first 10 months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia [106] The Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria-Hungary Montenegro allied itself with Serbia [107]\n\n\nWar in the Balkans\nFaced with Russia in the east,

Austro-Hungarian diplomats scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join the attack on Serbia [106] The Austro-Hungarian provinces of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia provided troops for Austria-Hungary Montenegro allied itself with Serbia [107]\n\n\nOttoman Empire\nThe Ottomans threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's communications with India via the Suez Canal The Ottoman Empire took advantage of the European powers' preoccupation with the war and conducted large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Christian populations—the Armenian genocide, Greek genocide, and Sayfo respectively [116] [117] [118]\n\n\nItalian Front\nThough Italy joined the Triple Alliance in 1882, a treaty with its traditional Austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in 1915 [128] This arose from nationalist designs on Austro-Hungarian territory in Trentino, the Austrian Littoral, Rijeka and Dalmatia, considered vital to secure the borders established in 1866 [129] In 1902, Rome secretly had agreed with France to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by Germany, effectively nullifying its role in the Triple Alliance [130]\n\n\nEastern Front\nAs previously agreed with French president Raymond Poincaré, Russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into Austrian Galicia and East Prussia as soon as possible Although their attack on Galicia was largely successful, and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing Germany to divert troops from the Western Front, the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions These weaknesses contributed to Russian defeats at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes in August and September 1914, forcing them to withdraw from East Prussia with heavy losses [143] [144] By spring 1915, they had also retreated from Galicia, and the May 1915 Gorlice–Tarnów offensive allowed the Central Powers to invade Russian-occupied Poland [145]\n\n\nInitial actions\nAs previously agreed with French president Raymond Poincaré, Russian plans at the start of the war

the May 1915 Gorlice–Tarnów offensive allowed the Central Powers to invade Russian-occupied Poland [145]\n\n\nRomanian participation\nDespite secretly agreeing to support the Triple Alliance in 1883, Romania increasingly found itself at odds with the Central Powers over their support for Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and the status of ethnic Romanian communities in Hungarian-controlled Transylvania, [149] which comprised an estimated 2.8 million of the 5.0 million population [150] With the ruling elite split into pro-German and pro-Entente factions, [151] Romania remained neutral for two years while allowing Germany and Austria to transport military supplies and advisors across Romanian territory [152]\n\n\nCentral Powers peace overtures\nOn 12 December 1916, after ten brutal months of the Battle of Verdun and a successful offensive against Romania, Germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies [160] However, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a \"duplicitous war ruse\" [160]\n\n\nFinal years of the war\nBy the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in Petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds [163] Revolutionaries set up the Petrograd Soviet and fearing a left-wing takeover, the State Duma forced Nicholas to abdicate and established the Russian Provisional Government, which confirmed Russia's willingness to continue the war However, the Petrograd Soviet refused to disband, creating competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised [164]\n\n\nRussian Revolution and withdrawal\nBy the end of 1916, Russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed, wounded or captured, with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices In March 1917, Tsar Nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in Petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds [163] Revolutionaries set up the Petrograd Soviet and fearing a left-wing takeover, the State Duma

competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos, with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised [164]\n\n\nUnited States enters the war\nThe United States was a major supplier of war material to the Allies but remained neutral in 1914, in large part due to domestic opposition [168] The most significant factor in creating the support Wilson needed was the German submarine offensive, which not only cost American lives but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea [169]\n\n\nNivelle Offensive (April–May 1917)\nIn December 1916, Robert Nivelle replaced Pétain as commander of French armies on the Western Front and began planning a spring attack in Champagne, part of a joint Franco-British operation [175] Poor security meant German intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables, but despite this, when the attack began on 16 April the French made substantial gains, before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the Hindenburg Line Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and, by 25 April, the French had suffered nearly 135,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, most incurred in the first two days [176]\n\n\nSinai and Palestine campaign (1917–1918)\nIn March and April 1917, at the First and Second Battles of Gaza, German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, which had begun in August 1916 at the Battle of Romani [181] [182] At the end of October 1917, the Sinai and Palestine campaign resumed, when General Edmund Allenby's XXth Corps, XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps won the Battle of Beersheba [183] Two Ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the Battle of Mughar Ridge and, early in December, Jerusalem had been captured following another Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Jerusalem [184] [185] [186] About this time, Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the Eighth Army's commander, replaced by Djevad Pasha, and a few months later the commander of the Ottoman Army in Palestine, Erich von Falkenhayn, was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders [187] [188]\n\n\nGerman offensive and Allied counter-offensive (March–November 1918)\nIn December 1917, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the West With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success in a final quick offensive [191] Ludendorff drew up plans (Operation Michael) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front The operation commenced on 21 March 1918, with an attack on British forces near Saint-Quentin German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (37 mi) [192] The initial offensive was a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted Lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic [193]\nGermany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany The German Army to the south then conducted Operations Blücher and Yorck, pushing broadly towards Paris Germany launched Operation Marne (Second Battle of the Marne) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle Reims The resulting counter-attack, which started the Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August, [194] led to a marked collapse in German morale [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nAllied advance to the Hindenburg Line\nBy September, the Germans had fallen back to the Hindenburg Line The Allies had advanced to the Hindenburg Line in the north and centre German forces launched numerous counterattacks, but positions and outposts of the Line continued falling, with the BEF alone taking 30,441 prisoners in the last week of September On 24 September, the Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable [198]\n\n\nBreakthrough of Macedonian front (September 1918)\nAllied forces started the Vardar offensive on 15 September at two key points: Dobro Pole and near Dojran Lake In the Battle of Dobro Pole, the Serbian and French armies had success after a three-day-long battle with relatively small casualties, and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front, something which was rarely seen in World War I After the front was broken, Allied forces started to liberate Serbia and reached Skopje at 29 September, after which Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September [201] [202]\n\n\nArmistices and capitulations\nThe collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, the Armistice of Salonica on 29 September 1918 [203] German Emperor Wilhelm II in a telegram to Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I described the situation thus: \"Disgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!\" [204] [205] On the same day, the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless [206]\n\n\nGerman government surrenders\nWith the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the Kaiser leading to his abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender Prince Maximilian of Baden took charge on October 3 as Chancellor of Germany Negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French Wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the German military [209]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn the aftermath of the war, the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires disappeared [f] Numerous nations regained their former independence, and new ones were created Four dynasties fell as a result of the war: the Romanovs, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburgs, and the Ottomans Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4 million soldiers dead, [215] not counting other casualties Germany and Russia were similarly affected [216]\n\n\nFormal end of the war\nA formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919 The US Senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for it, [217] [218] and did not formally end its involvement in the war until the Knox–Porter Resolution was signed on 2 July 1921 by President Warren G Harding [219] For the British Empire, the state of war ceased under the provisions of the Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act 1918 concerning:\n\n\nPeace treaties and national boundaries\nThe Paris Peace Conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on Wilson's 14th point, established the League of Nations on 28 June 1919 [226] [227]\n\n\nNational identities\nAfter 123 years, Poland re-emerged as an independent country The Kingdom of Serbia and its dynasty, as a \"minor Entente nation\" and the country with the most casualties per capita, [236] [237] [238] became the backbone of a new multinational state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia Czechoslovakia, combining the Kingdom of Bohemia with parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, became a new nation Romania would unite all Romanian-speaking people under a single state, leading to Greater Romania [239]\n\n\nCasualties\nOf the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, an estimated 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria-Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5% [245] France mobilised 7.8 million men, of which 1.4 million died and 3.2 million were injured [246] Approximately 15,000 deployed men sustained gruesome facial injuries, causing social stigma and marginalisation; they were called the gueules cassées (broken faces) In Germany, civilian deaths were 474,000 higher than in peacetime, due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that had weakened disease resistance These excess deaths are estimated as 271,000 in 1918, plus another 71,000 in the first half of 1919 when the blockade was still in effect [247] Starvation caused by famine killed approximately 100,000 people in Lebanon [248]\n\n\nWar crimes\nThe German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (April–May 1915), after German scientists under the direction of Fritz Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine [g] [257] The use of chemical weapons had been sanctioned by the German High Command to force Allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions, complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons [257] Chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately 1.3 million casualties, of which about 90,000 were fatal [257] The use of chemical weapons in warfare was a direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use [258] [259]\n\n\nChemical weapons in warfare\nThe German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (April–May 1915), after

Ottoman Empire's Armenian population, including mass deportations and executions, during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered genocide [261] The Ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the Armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of Armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination [262] In early 1915, several Armenians volunteered to join the Russian forces and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the Tehcir Law (Law on Deportation), which authorised the deportation of Armenians from the Empire's eastern provinces to Syria between 1915 and 1918 The Armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands [263] While the exact number of deaths is unknown, the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates around 1.5 million [261] [264] The government of Turkey continues to deny the genocide to the present day, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians [265]\n\n\nPrisoners of war\nAbout 8 million soldiers surrendered and were held in POW camps during the war All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front [270]\n\n\nSoldiers' experiences\nAllied personnel was around 42,928,000, while Central personnel was near 25,248,000 [216] [272] British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but were increasingly conscripted Surviving veterans returning home often found they could discuss their experiences only among themselves, so formed \"veterans' associations\" or \"Legions\".\n\n\nConscription\nConscription was common in most European countries However, it was controversial in English-speaking countries, [273] It was especially unpopular among minority ethnicities—especially the Irish Catholics in Ireland, [274] Australia, [275] [276] and the French Catholics in Canada [277] [278]\n\n\nMilitary attachés and war correspondents\nMilitary and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war [281] Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern \"embedded\" positions within the opposing land and naval forces [282] [283]\n\n\nEconomic effects\n\nMacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war Families were altered by the departure of many men With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers At the same time, the industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war This aided the struggle for voting rights for women [284]\n\nSupport and opposition for the war\nIn the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, Ante Trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia The Yugoslav Committee, led by Trumbić, was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London [298] In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including Czechoslovak, Italian, Polish, Transylvanian, and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to support national self-determination for the peoples residing within Austria-Hungary [299]\n\n\nSupport\nIn the Balkans, Yugoslav nationalists such as the leader, Ante Trumbić, strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of Yugoslavs from Austria-Hungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent Yugoslavia The Yugoslav Committee, led by Trumbić, was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London [298] In April 1918, the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including Czechoslovak, Italian, Polish, Transylvanian, and Yugoslav representatives who urged the Allies to support national self-determination for the peoples residing within Austria-Hungary [299]\n\n\nPatriotic funds\nOn both sides, there was large-scale fundraising for soldiers' welfare, their dependents and those injured The Nail Men were a German example Around the British Empire, there were many patriotic funds, including the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation, Canadian Patriotic Fund, Queensland Patriotic Fund and, by 1919, there were 983 funds in New Zealand [311] At the start of the next world war the New Zealand funds were reformed, having been criticised as overlapping, wasteful and abused, [312] but 11 were still functioning in 2002 [313]\n\n\nOpposition\n\nMany countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict These included Eugene Debs in the US and Bertrand Russell in Britain In the US, the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918 made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed \"disloyal\" Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors, [314] and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.\n\nTechnology\nWorld War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties By the end of 1917, however, the major armies had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, [324] armoured cars, tanks (especially with the advent of the prototype tank, Little Willie), and aircraft [325]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs In addition, multiple peace proposals were coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far [329] [330] [331]\n\n\nLegacy and memory\nMemorials were built in thousands of villages and towns Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the German War Graves Commission, and Le Souvenir français Many of these graveyards also have monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the Menin Gate Memorial to the Missing and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme [332] [333]\n\n\nMemorials\nMemorials were built in thousands of villages and

Gate Memorial to the Missing and the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme [332] [333]\n\n\nHistoriography\n... \"Strange, friend,\" I said, \"Here is no cause to mourn.\"\n\"None,\" said the other, \"Save the undone years\"... \n\n\nUnexploded ordnance\nAs late as 2007, unexploded ordnance at battlefield sites like Verdun and Somme continued to pose a danger In France and Belgium, locals who discover caches of unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units In some places, plant life has still not recovered from the effects of the war [341]\n\n\nSee

Vetrimaaran has an elder sister and later moved to Ranipet, where he spent his childhood.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGrowing up in a family of intellectuals, Vetrimaaran was exposed to literature and art from a young age.

{"title": "Carlo_Ancelotti", "content": "\nClub career\nAncelotti began his career in 1974 with Parma He made his professional debut in Serie C during the 1976–77 season, at the age of 18 Under manager Cesare Maldini, he was often deployed as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker, due to his eye for goal Ancelotti excelled in these roles and helped Parma to a second place in the Serie C1 girone A during the 1978–79 season, which qualified the team for the Serie B play-offs In the decisive match in Vicenza, against Triestina, with the score tied at 1–1, he scored two goals, which gave Parma a 3–1 victory and sealed their place in Serie B the following season [14] [15] [16] [17]\n\n\nParma\nAncelotti joined Parma the following season, [29] a team which had recently enjoyed several years of domestic and European success under the previous manager Nevio Scala, and which contained several promising young players, including future Italy stars Gianluigi Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro [30] Ancelotti made his debut in the Coppa Italia in a 3–1 loss to Pescara [31] Ancelotti made several changes at the club, implementing a rigorous Sacchi-inspired 4–4–2 formation, and initially deploying creative forward Gianfranco Zola out of position on the left wing in order to accommodate Hristo Stoichkov up-front, although both players were later eventually sold by the club after lack of playing time, due to struggling to perform in this system [32] With the new attacking partnership of Enrico Chiesa and Hernán Crespo, Parma finished second in Serie A during the 1996–97 season under Ancelotti, which guaranteed them a place in the next edition of the UEFA Champions League [30] [33] [34]\n\n\nRoma\nAfter attracting strong interest from Inter Milan, in mid-1979 Ancelotti transferred to Roma, and made his Serie A debut in a 0–0 draw against AC Milan on 16 September [14] [15] [18] Under manager Nils Liedholm, he was deployed as a winger or central midfielder and became one of the club's most important players, in a team which featured Brazilian midfielders Falcão and Toninho Cerezo, as well as Italian footballers Roberto Pruzzo, Bruno Conti, Agostino Di Bartolomei and Pietro Vierchowod, winning consecutive Coppa Italia titles in his first two seasons with the club During his eight seasons in Rome, he won the Coppa Italia a total of four times (1980, 1981, 1984 and 1986) After struggling with knee injuries, and managing second and third-place league finishes in 1981 and 1982, Ancelotti helped lead the team to win the Italian championship in 1983, the club's second league title in their history [15]\n\n\nAC Milan\nAncelotti was appointed Milan manager on 5 November 2001, after Fatih Terim was dismissed due to poor results [14] [16] [18] [47] He was inheriting another recently trophyless team in Milan, as the Rossoneri had floundered domestically and in Europe since their last Scudetto victory in 1999 In the 2001–02 season, Ancelotti led Milan to qualify for the Champions League once again, as the team managed a fourth-place finish in Serie A, [48] and also reached semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, their best ever finish in the competition, losing out to Borussia Dortmund, [49] [50] and also suffered a semi-final elimination in the Coppa Italia to Juventus [49]\n\n\nInternational career\nUnder manager Enzo Bearzot, Ancelotti made his Italy national team debut and scored his first and only goal on 6 January 1981 in the 1980 World Champions' Gold Cup against the Netherlands, which ended in a 1–1 draw [15] [18] He was very likely to be capped for the 1982 World Cup campaign, but a dramatic knee injury forced him away for several months, as Italy went on to win the tournament without him [15] [18] He was a part of Italy's World Cup squad in the 1986 World Cup, where he did not make a single appearance, however, as both he and Paolo Rossi struggled during the team's fitness tests, due to the altitude of the region, and were replaced in the starting line-up by Fernando De Napoli and Giuseppe Galderisi, respectively [21]\n\n\nInternational goals\nAncelotti was a midfielder known for his leadership and creativity; he was regarded as one of the best Italian midfielders of his generation [14] [15] [16] Although he lacked pace and physicality, he was a talented, hardworking, and tenacious player who had excellent technical ability, tactical intelligence, vision, and passing range; his most notable skill being his powerful and accurate shooting from outside the box A versatile midfielder, he was capable playing several midfield positions [15] [18] [22] He often played as a deep-lying playmaker, as a central midfielder, or as a defensive midfielder, which allowed him to set the tempo of play after winning back the ball; he was also the mentor and predecessor of Demetrio Albertini and Andrea Pirlo when he was a playmaker at Milan Despite his abilities, his playing time was cut short by several injuries, which forced him into retirement in 1992 at the age of 33 [15] [22] [17] [23] [24] [25]\n\n\nStyle of play\nAncelotti was a midfielder known for his leadership and creativity; he was

Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi between 1992 and 1995, and reaching the 1994 World Cup final, [14] [16] [18] Ancelotti began his managerial career with Serie B side Reggiana in 1995–96 season, [27] where he

was appointed manager of Juventus, where he both succeeded and preceded Marcello Lippi, who returned to the club when Ancelotti left [39] [40] With Juventus, Ancelotti became less rigorous with the team's formation, abandoning his favoured 4–4–2 in order to accommodate French playmaker Zinedine Zidane in his preferred free role behind the forwards in the team's starting line-up [32] Juventus reached the semi-finals of the Champions League during the 1998–99 season, losing out to eventual champions Manchester United, [41] but finished in seventh place in Serie A, failing to qualify for the Champions League the following season and also losing out to Udinese on aggregate in the UEFA Cup play-offs, meaning they qualified for the Intertoto Cup [42]\n\n\nAC Milan\nAncelotti was appointed

June 2013, Ancelotti became the manager of Real Madrid, replacing the departing José Mourinho, and signing a three-year contract [116] [117] He was introduced at a press conference at the Santiago Bernabéu, where it was also announced that Zinedine Zidane and Paul Clement would be his assistant coaches Shortly following his arrival, Real Madrid confirmed the signing of Isco for a fee of €24 million, which was followed by the signing of Asier Illarramendi for €32 million Argentinean striker Gonzalo Higuaín left the club for €40 million to Napoli This, along with the sale of Mesut Özil to Arsenal, paved the way for Gareth Bale's signing from Tottenham Hotspur for then-world record fee of £86 million (€105M) [118] In Ancelotti's first league game in charge, on 18 August 2013, Real Madrid started the season by winning 2–1 at home against Real Betis [119] Ancelotti eventually deviated from the 4–2–3–1 formation that had been deployed by his predecessor José Mourinho, switching instead to a 4–3–3 formation to great effect, in which Argentine winger Ángel Di María particularly excelled as a left-sided central midfielder, and played a key role in the club's successes [120]\n\n\nBayern Munich\nOn 20 December 2015, Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed that Ancelotti would replace Pep Guardiola as manager for the 2016–17 season, signing a three-year

2019, Ancelotti was appointed as manager of Everton on a four-and-a-half-year contract [167] His first match in charge was a 1–0 home victory over Burnley on 26 December [168] On 1 March 2020, Ancelotti was sent off after the full-time whistle, following an on-pitch conversation with the referee Chris Kavanagh, who had ruled out a would-be late match-winning goal against Manchester United,

the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of a possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España [179] [180] [181] Thus, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid, [182]

record fifth in the competition, a lone Vinícius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, and Ancelotti's second in charge Real also claimed their fourth ever European double [185] [186]

Scaloni [189] [190]\n\n\nStyle of management and reception\nToward the beginning of his coaching career, and during his time with Parma, Ancelotti preferred to use a rigorous 4–4–2 formation, which made use of heavy pressing, and drew influence from that of his Milan and Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi, and which he believed to be the most successful system for his team; however, this system did not allow for more creative forwards, such as Gianfranco Zola, Hristo Stoichkov and Roberto Baggio, to play in their preferred positions, and ultimately led to Zola and Stoichkov's departure from the club, while Baggio's transfer to Parma in 1997 was impeded by Ancelotti Ancelotti later stated that he regretted his intransigence, and when he joined Juventus, he abandoned his favoured 4–4–2 in favour of a 3–4–1–2 system, in order to accommodate Zinedine Zidane in his preferred advanced playmaking role behind the forwards [17] [216] [30] [36] [32] [35] [217] In addition to Sacchi, Ancelotti has also cited his former Roma manager Nils Liedholm, and his youth coach Bruno Mora as major influences [218] [219] [220] The positive leadership style of his Roma manager Sven-Göran Eriksson also inspired Ancelotti's own coaching style [221]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAncelotti has two children: a daughter, and a son, Davide, who was his assistant coach at Everton, and now also at Real Madrid Davide previously also played in the Milan youth team and joined Borgomanero in June 2008 [260] In 2008, Ancelotti confirmed in an interview that he had broken up with his wife of 25 years, Luisa Gibellini [260] [261] He subsequently dated Romanian Marina Crețu In 2011, it was announced he was dating Canadian businesswoman Mariann Barrena McClay Ancelotti and Barrena McClay married in Vancouver in July

Ancelotti eventually deviated from the 4–2–3–1 formation that had been deployed by his predecessor José Mourinho, switching instead to a 4–3–3 formation to great effect, in which Argentine winger Ángel Di María particularly excelled as a left-sided central midfielder, and played a key role in the club's successes.\n\n**Bayern Munich**\n\nOn 20 December 2015, Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed that Ancelotti would replace Pep Guardiola as manager for the 2016–17 season, signing a three-year contract. His contract started on 1 July 2016.\n\nHis first training session was on 11 July 2016, and his first match was a pre-season win against SV Lippstadt. His first match at Allianz Arena was a 1–0 pre-season win over his predecessor Guardiola's Manchester City.\n\n**Napoli**\n\nOn 23 May 2018, Ancelotti was appointed as head coach of Napoli, signing a three-year contract, replacing Maurizio Sarri in the role.\n\nOn 19 August, he made his return to the Serie A, winning his first match as manager with a 2–1 away victory over Lazio. Napoli suffered a first round elimination in the Champions League, the first time since 2000 that Ancelotti failed to advance from this stage of the competition.\n\n**Everton**\n\nOn 21 December 2019, Ancelotti was appointed as manager of Everton on a four-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nHis first match in charge was a 1–0 home victory over Burnley on 26 December. On 1 March 2020, Ancelotti was sent off after the full-time whistle, following an on-pitch conversation with the referee Chris Kavanagh, who had ruled out a would-be late match-winning goal against Manchester United, due to an offside that was determined by VAR.\n\n**Return to Real Madrid**\n\nOn 1 June 2021, Ancelotti resigned from his position at Everton to rejoin Real Madrid, following Zidane's resignation, signing a contract until 2024.\n\nOn 19 September 2021, Ancelotti reached the milestone of 800 league matches with clubs from the top five European leagues.\n\nOn the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of a possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España. Thus, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid, in addition to becoming the first manager to win all of Europe's top five leagues.\n\n**Style of Management and Reception**\n\nToward the beginning of his coaching career, and during his time with Parma, Ancelotti preferred to use a rigorous 4–4–2 formation, which made use of heavy pressing, and drew influence from that of his Milan and Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi, and which he believed to be the most successful system for his team.\n\nHowever, this system did not allow for more creative forwards, such as Gianfranco Zola, Hristo Stoichkov and Roberto Baggio, to play in their preferred positions, and ultimately led to Zola and Stoichkov's departure from the club, while Baggio's transfer to Parma in 1997 was impeded by Ancelotti.\n\nAncelotti later stated that he regretted his intransigence, and when he joined Juventus, he abandoned his favoured 4–4–2 in favour of a 3–4–1–2 system, in order to accommodate Zinedine Zidane in his preferred advanced playmaking role behind the forwards.\n\nIn addition to Sacchi, Ancelotti has also cited his former Roma manager Nils Liedholm, and his youth coach Bruno Mora as major influences. The positive leadership style of his Roma manager Sven-Göran Eriksson also inspired Ancelotti's own coaching style.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nAncelotti has two children: a daughter, and a son, Davide, who was his assistant coach at Everton, and now also at Real Madrid.\n\nIn 2008, Ancelotti confirmed in an interview that he had broken up with his wife of 25 years, Luisa Gibellini.\n\nHe subsequently dated Romanian Marina Crețu.\n\nIn 2011, it was announced he was dating Canadian businesswoman Mariann Barrena McClay.\n\nAncelotti and Barrena McClay married in Vancouver in July 2014.\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\n**Managerial Statistics**\n\n* S  Wins\n* D  Draws\n* L  Losses\n* GF  Goals For\n* GA  Goals Against\n* GD  Goal Difference\n* Pts  Points\n* %  Win Percentage\n\n**Honours**\n\n* Serie A: 3\n\t+ 1995 (Reggiana)\n\t+ 1998 (Juventus)\n\t+ 2014 (Real Madrid)\n* Coppa Italia: 2\n\t+ 1996 (Parma)\n\t+ 1999 (Juventus)\n* Supercoppa Italiana: 1\n\t+ 1999 (Juventus)\n* Champions League: 1\n\t+ 2014 (Real Madrid)\n* UEFA Super Cup: 1\n\t+ 2014 (Real Madrid)\n* FIFA Club World Cup: 1\n\t+ 2014 (Real Madrid)\n* La Liga: 1\n\t+ 2022 (Real Madrid)\n* Supercopa de España: 1\n\t+ 2022 (Real Madrid)\n\n**Orders**\n\n* Italian Order of Merit for Sport (2007)\n* Commander of the Order of the Star of Italy (2012)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of football managers with 500 or more games\n* List of UEFA Champions League winning managers\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Carlo Ancelotti\".

in English about \"Carlo_Ancelotti\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nAncelotti began his career in 1974 with Parma He made his professional debut in Serie C during the 1976–77 season, at the age of 18 Under manager Cesare Maldini, he was often deployed as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker, due to his eye for goal Ancelotti excelled in these roles and helped Parma to a second place in the Serie C1 girone A during the 1978–79 season, which qualified the team for the Serie B play-offs In the decisive match in Vicenza, against Triestina, with the score tied at 1–1, he scored two goals, which gave Parma a 3–1 victory and sealed their place in Serie B the following season [14] [15] [16] [17]\n\n\nParma\nAncelotti joined Parma the following season, [29] a team which had recently enjoyed several years of domestic and European success under the previous manager Nevio Scala, and which contained several promising young players, including future Italy stars Gianluigi Buffon and Fabio Cannavaro [30] Ancelotti made his debut in the Coppa Italia in a 3–1 loss to Pescara [31] Ancelotti made several changes at the club, implementing a rigorous Sacchi-inspired 4–4–2 formation, and initially deploying creative forward Gianfranco Zola out of position on the left wing in order to accommodate Hristo Stoichkov up-front, although both players were later eventually sold by the club after lack of playing time, due to struggling to perform in this system [32] With the new attacking partnership of Enrico Chiesa and Hernán Crespo, Parma finished second in Serie A during the 1996–97 season under Ancelotti, which guaranteed them a place in the next edition of the UEFA Champions League [30] [33] [34]\n\n\nRoma\nAfter attracting strong interest from Inter Milan, in mid-1979 Ancelotti transferred to Roma, and made his Serie A debut in a 0–0 draw against AC Milan on 16 September [14] [15] [18] Under manager Nils Liedholm, he was deployed as a winger or central midfielder and became one of the club's most important players, in a team which featured Brazilian midfielders Falcão and Toninho Cerezo, as well as Italian footballers Roberto Pruzzo, Bruno Conti, Agostino Di Bartolomei and Pietro Vierchowod, winning consecutive Coppa Italia titles in his first two seasons with the club During his eight seasons in Rome, he won the Coppa Italia a total of four times (1980, 1981, 1984 and 1986) After struggling with knee injuries, and managing second and third-place league finishes in 1981 and 1982, Ancelotti helped lead the team to win the Italian championship in 1983, the club's second league title in their history [15]\n\n\nAC Milan\nAncelotti was appointed Milan manager on 5 November 2001, after Fatih Terim was dismissed due to poor results [14] [16] [18] [47] He was inheriting another recently trophyless team in Milan, as the Rossoneri had floundered domestically and in Europe since their last Scudetto victory in 1999 In the 2001–02 season, Ancelotti led Milan to qualify for the Champions League once again, as the team managed a fourth-place finish in Serie A, [48] and also reached semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, their best ever finish in the competition, losing out to Borussia Dortmund, [49] [50] and also suffered a semi-final elimination in the Coppa Italia to Juventus [49]\n\n\nInternational career\nUnder manager Enzo Bearzot, Ancelotti made his Italy national team debut and scored his first and only goal on 6 January 1981 in the 1980 World Champions' Gold Cup against the Netherlands, which ended in a 1–1 draw [15] [18] He was very likely to be capped for the 1982 World Cup campaign, but a dramatic knee injury forced him away for several months, as Italy went on to win the tournament without him [15] [18] He was a part of Italy's World Cup squad in the 1986 World Cup, where he did not make a single appearance, however, as both he and Paolo Rossi struggled during the team's fitness tests, due to the altitude of the region, and were replaced in the starting line-up by Fernando De Napoli and Giuseppe Galderisi, respectively [21]\n\n\nInternational goals\nAncelotti was a midfielder known for his leadership and creativity; he was regarded as one of the best Italian midfielders of his generation [14] [15] [16] Although he lacked pace and physicality, he was a talented, hardworking, and tenacious player who had excellent technical ability, tactical intelligence, vision, and passing range; his most notable skill being his powerful and accurate shooting from outside the box A versatile midfielder, he was capable playing several midfield positions [15] [18] [22] He often played as a deep-lying playmaker, as a central midfielder, or as a defensive midfielder, which allowed him to set the tempo of play after winning back the ball; he was also the mentor and predecessor of Demetrio Albertini and Andrea Pirlo when he was a playmaker at Milan Despite his abilities, his playing time was cut short by several injuries, which forced him into retirement in 1992 at the age of 33 [15] [22] [17] [23] [24] [25]\n\n\nStyle of play\nAncelotti was a midfielder known for his leadership and creativity; he

was appointed manager of Juventus, where he both succeeded and preceded Marcello Lippi, who returned to the club when Ancelotti left [39] [40] With Juventus, Ancelotti became less rigorous with the team's formation, abandoning his favoured 4–4–2 in order to accommodate French playmaker Zinedine Zidane in his preferred free role behind the forwards in the team's starting line-up [32] Juventus reached the semi-finals of the Champions League during the 1998–99 season, losing out to eventual champions Manchester United, [41] but finished in seventh place in Serie A, failing to qualify for the

Madrid started the season by winning 2–1 at home against Real Betis [119] Ancelotti eventually deviated from the 4–2–3–1 formation that had been deployed by his predecessor José Mourinho, switching

The club was founded in 1898 and is one of the most successful clubs in Swiss football history.\n\n**History**\n\nThe club was founded in 1898 by a group of young men who wanted to form a sports club. The name \"Young Boys\" was chosen to mimic that of the Basel-based club Old Boys. The club's early years were marked by a series of mergers and name changes, with the association's name being changed from FC Young Boys to Berner Sport Club Young Boys in 1925.\n\n**1902–1925: The Early Years**\n\nThe club's early years were marked by a series of struggles on and off the pitch. The team played in the small and outdated Spitalacker-platz, which was not suitable for a growing club. In 1902, the club was relegated to the second tier of Swiss football, where it remained for several years.\n\n**1925–1951: New Name and New Stadium**\n\nIn 1925, the association's name was changed from FC Young Boys to Berner Sport Club Young Boys. This year was also the last game on the old Spitalacker-platz. In October, the new Wankdorf Stadium, designed by the architects Scherler & Berger, was opened with a tournament. The new sports complex included a main grandstand with 1,200 covered seats, a restaurant, changing rooms, a training hall, and a training ground. The total attendance capacity of the stadium was 22,000, including covered standing room for 5,000.\n\n**1951–1964: The Golden Years Under Coach Albert Sing**\n\nIn 1951, Norbert Eric Jones was replaced as manager by Albert Sing, a German coach who had previously played for the club. Sing was initially player-coach before deciding to become a trainer only. During his tenure, YB experienced its most successful period, with the team being reinforced by high-level transfers such as Eugene \"Geni\" Meier. Considerable success during this period was also attributed to the goalkeeper Walter Eich, who was one of the best in the history of the Young Boys. Later, the team consisted of top players like Heinz Schneite and Ernst Wechselberger.\n\n**1964–1984: Averageness**\n\nThe successor to Albert Sing had large shoes to fill, and average performance was no longer acceptable to the discriminating Bernese supporters. Heinz Bigler and Hans Grütter took over the training until Hans Merkle ultimately succeeded Sing. Merkle had the misfortune to be measured against the championships of his predecessor, although Geni Meier, Ernst Wechselberger, and other players from the championship years continued to play. It mattered little, as Merkle was a demanding coach of the German school, and was able to keep YB in the top half of the table, with finishes of second, fifth, and seventh.\n\n**1984–1991: The Mandziara Era**\n\nTurbulent times continued in the Wankdorf after many coaching changes, with Alexander Mandziara being hired as manager in 1984. The quiet Pole with a German passport played offensive football and was known for hard training sessions. In his first years, Young Boys reached only ninth place. In the next season, 1985-86, not all went for YB, but the team still managed to finish the preliminary round in fifth. During the winter break, the Swede Robert Prytz joined the YB midfield as a playmaker alongside Georges Bregy, and YB achieved an incomparable return round.

several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation of the military in 1948 [189] Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter Civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr said that he was \"a legend and a symbol in his own time\", and that he \"challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration.\" [190] According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's \"efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ..

Born on January 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia, Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947, becoming the first African American player in the league. His remarkable career, marked by unprecedented achievements and enduring legacy, has made him one of the most beloved and respected figures in American sports history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJackie Robinson was born into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia, on January 31, 1919. He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (née McGriff) and Jerry Robinson. His middle name, Roosevelt, honored the former President Theodore Roosevelt, who died 25 days before Robinson's birth. After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to Pasadena, California, where they settled in a small apartment.\n\n**Family and Personal Life**\n\nRobinson's family life was marked by hardship and struggle. His mother, Mallie, managed the household and cared for her five children, while his father, Jerry, abandoned the family. Despite the challenges, Robinson's mother instilled in him a strong sense of values, discipline, and education. Robinson's brothers, Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed \"Mack\"), and Willa Mae, were all accomplished athletes, and their influence helped shape Robinson's athletic career.\n\n**John Muir High School**\n\nIn 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir Technical High School. Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers, Frank and Mack, inspired him to pursue his interest in sports. At Muir High, Robinson played football, basketball, and track, and was an accomplished athlete. His athletic prowess earned him recognition, and he became a standout player on the school's teams.\n\n**Pasadena Junior College**\n\nAfter graduating from Muir High, Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track. On the football team, he played quarterback and safety, while on the baseball team, he was a shortstop and leadoff hitter. Robinson broke an American junior college broad-jump record held by his brother Mack with a jump of 25 ft 6 1/2 in on May 7, 1938. His teammates were predominantly white, but Robinson's exceptional abilities earned him respect and admiration from his peers.\n\n**UCLA and Afterward**\n\nAfter graduating from PJC in spring 1939, Robinson enrolled at UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track. Robinson's athletic achievements at UCLA were impressive, and he was recognized as one of the school's top athletes.\n\n**Military Career**\n\nIn 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit at Fort Riley, Kansas. Despite the challenges of being a black soldier in a segregated unit, Robinson distinguished himself as an athlete and a leader. He applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) located at Fort Riley, but his application was rejected due to his race.\n\n**Post-Military**\n\nAfter his discharge, Robinson briefly returned to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. He then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor, Rev Karl Downs, to be the athletic director at Samuel Huston College in Austin, Texas. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944-45 season.

Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 fielding percentage that year (second in the National League at the position, fractionally behind Stanky) Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season [149] In a 12–7 win against the St Louis Cardinals on August 29, 1948, he hit for the cycle—a home run, a triple, a double, and a single in the same game [150] The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the pennant and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series [151]\n\n\nPennant races and outside interests (1951–1953)\nBefore the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career O'Malley was quoted in the Montreal Standard as saying, \"Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post\"—although reports

in the 1955 World Series [182] Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a third baseman, both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base [183] Robinson, then 36 years old, [184] missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series [171] He missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base That season, the Dodgers' Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year [185]\n\n\nLegacy\nRobinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation of the military in 1948 [189] Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter Civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr said that he was \"a legend and a symbol in his own time\", and that he \"challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration.\" [190] According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's \"efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ..  [His] accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities.\" [191]\n\n\nPortrayals on stage, film and television\nRobinson portrayed himself in the 1950 motion picture The Jackie Robinson Story [203]\nOther portrayals include:\n\n\nPost-baseball life\nRobinson once told future Hall of Fame inductee Hank Aaron that \"the game of baseball is great, but the greatest thing is what you do after your career is over.\" [219] Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 1957 [220] Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, he was diagnosed with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers [221] Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease [222]\n\n\nFamily life and death\nAfter Robinson's retirement from baseball, his wife Rachel Robinson pursued a career in academic nursing She became an assistant professor at the Yale School of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center [250] She also served on the board of the Freedom National Bank until it closed in 1990 [251] She and Jackie had three children: Jackie Robinson Jr (1946–1971), Sharon Robinson (b 1950), and David Robinson (b 1952) [1]\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nOn June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Robinson's uniform number, 42, alongside those of former teammates Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32) [269] In 2017, a statue of Robinson, created by sculptor Branly Cadet, was unveiled at Dodger Stadium It was the first statue the Dodgers ever unveiled [270]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBook sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on 10 February 1903, in Nandankode, Trivandrum, to a Pulaya Christian family, Rosy's life was marked by both personal struggles and professional triumphs.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRajamma was born to a family of modest means, with her father, Poulose, serving as the cook for the foreign missionary Parker of the LMS church. However, her father's untimely death when she was young left her family in a state of financial distress. Despite these challenges, Rosy's family encouraged her to pursue her passion for the performing arts. She regularly attended the local school of performing arts, where she studied Kakkarissi Natakam, a traditional form of folk dance and drama.\n\nGrowing up in a culturally rich and diverse environment, Rosy was exposed to various forms of art and entertainment. Her family's Christian background and her father's association with the LMS church also influenced her early life and career. The church's emphasis on education and community service instilled in Rosy a strong sense of social responsibility, which would later shape her approach to her craft and her role in the film industry.\n\n**Career**\n\nBy the late 1920s, Rosy had already gained recognition as a talented performer in the folk drama circuit. She was part of the Cheramar Kalavedi, an association of artists that provided a platform for talented individuals to hone their skills and gain experience. This association became a training ground for performers like Rosy, who eventually went on to join the Kakkarasi drama troupe.\n\nAs a member of the Kakkarasi drama troupe, Rosy's talent and charisma caught the attention of JC Daniel, a prominent filmmaker of the time. Daniel was impressed by Rosy's performances and saw her as the ideal candidate to play the lead role in his film, Vigathukumaran. The film was a groundbreaking production that told the story of a Nair woman's struggle for independence and self-respect.\n\nRosy's portrayal of Sarojini, a Nair woman, in Vigathukumaran was a significant departure from the traditional roles usually assigned to women in Malayalam cinema. Her performance was met with both critical acclaim and controversy, as members of the Nair community were outraged by a Dalit woman playing a Nair character. The film's release was marred by protests and violence, with audiences throwing stones at the screen and eventually damaging the theater.\n\nDespite the backlash, Rosy's performance in Vigathukumaran remains a pivotal moment in Malayalam cinema history. Her courage and determination to take on a role that challenged societal norms paved the way for future generations of actresses and helped to establish her as a pioneering figure in the industry.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRosy's story was first rediscovered in the late 1960s by Chelangatt Gopalakrishnan, a film historian and critic. Gopalakrishnan's work helped to shed light on Rosy's contributions to the development of Malayalam cinema and her role as a trailblazer for women in the industry.\n\nIn 1971, Kunnukuzhi published an article about Rosy, which further highlighted her achievements and paved the way for a renewed interest in her life and work. Today, Rosy is recognized as a pioneering figure in Malayalam cinema, and her legacy continues to inspire new generations of actors, filmmakers, and women in the industry.\n\nRosy's impact on Malayalam cinema extends beyond her performances and her role as a trailblazer. Her courage and determination to challenge societal norms and conventions have left a lasting legacy in the industry. Her story serves as a reminder of the importance of diversity, inclusivity, and social responsibility in the arts and entertainment industry.\n\nIn conclusion, P._K._Rosy was a pioneering Indian actress who played a significant role in the development of the Malayalam film industry. Her life and career were marked by both personal struggles and professional triumphs, which have left a lasting legacy in the industry. Her courage and determination to challenge societal norms and conventions have inspired new generations of actors, filmmakers, and women in the industry, and her story continues to be an important part of Malayalam cinema history.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"P._K._Rosy\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nShe was born as Rajamma, on 10 February 1903 at Nandankode Trivandrum to a Pulaya Christian family Rosy's father Poulose was the cook of the foreign missionary parker of LMS church Her father died when she was young leaving her family in poverty She also regularly went to the local school of performing arts to study Kakkarissi Natakam [2] [3]\n\n\nCareer\nBy 1928, she performed Kakkirasi, harvest songs  and folk songs formed under the association of artists called \"Cheramar Kalavedi\" which became a training ground for entering into the yard of the Temple of art The Kakkarasi drama troupe and Rajah Party Drama Troop competed with each other for Rosamma, this competition enhanced the star value of the actress Rosamma From this, she stepped in to become the heroine of JC Daniel's film after his first prospective heroine proved unsuited for the role [3] She played the character of Sarojini, a Nair woman, in the movie [11] When Vigathukumaran was released, members of the Nair community were enraged to see a Dalit woman portray a Nair Many eminent members of the film industry at the time refused to come and inaugurate the opening of Vigathakumaran if Rosy was to be physically present there, including the famous lawyer Madhoor Govindan Pillai Following a scene in which the main character kissed a flower in her hair, the audience threw stones at the screen The director, Daniel, himself didn't invite her to the opening at Capitol theatre in Thiruvananthapuram, fearing a backlash but Rosy had attended anyway but was still made to watch a second showing by those boycotting the event The crowd transformed into an angry mob which tore down the screen and damaged the theatre [12] Eventually, Rosy had to flee [13]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe story of the film was first rediscovered in the late 1960s by Chelangatt Gopalakrishnan while in 1971 Kunnukuzhi published his first article about her [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The fandom has evolved over the years, with a diverse range of interests, activities, and lifestyles associated with it.\n\n**History**\n\nThe furry fandom has its roots in the 1970s, when cartoonists Ken Fletcher and Reed Waller created the amateur press association Vootie, dedicated to animal-focused art. Many of its featured works contained adult themes, such as \"Omaha\" the Cat Dancer, which included explicit sex. Vootie grew a small following over the next several years, and its contributors began meeting at science fiction and comics conventions. The early furry fandom was influenced by allegorical novels, including works of science fiction and fantasy, as well as cartoons featuring anthropomorphic animals.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\nAllegorical novels, including works of both science fiction and fantasy, and cartoons featuring anthropomorphic animals are often cited as the earliest inspiration for the fandom. A survey conducted in 2007 suggested that, when compared with a non-furry control group, a higher proportion of those identifying as furries liked cartoons \"a great deal\" as children and recalled watching them significantly more often, as well as being more likely to enjoy works of science fiction than those outside of the community.\n\n**Activities**\n\nAccording to a survey from 2008, most furries believe that visual art, conventions, literature, and online communities are strongly important to the fandom. The furry fandom is male-dominated, with surveys reporting around 80% male respondents. Fans with craft skills create plush toys, and also build elaborate costumes called fursuits, which are worn for fun or to participate in parades, convention masquerades, dances, or fund-raising charity events (as entertainers). Fursuits range from designs featuring simple construction resembling some entertainment and sports mascots to those with more sophisticated features such as moving jaw mechanisms, animatronic parts, prosthetic makeup, and other features.\n\n**Crafts**\n\nFans with craft skills create plush toys, and also build elaborate costumes called fursuits. Fursuits range from designs featuring simple construction resembling some entertainment and sports mascots to those with more sophisticated features such as moving jaw mechanisms, animatronic parts, prosthetic makeup, and other features. Fursuits range in price from $500, for mascot-like designs, to an upwards of $10,000 for models incorporating animatronics. About 80% of furries do not own a full fursuit. Some fans may also wear \"partial\" suits consisting simply of ears and a tail, or a head, paws, and a tail. A much larger proportion of individuals who attend conventions own a full or partial fursuit—45%, according to a survey done at Anthrocon 2018—which has been attributed to convention attendees' generally higher likelihood to be able to afford to buy a fursuit if they can afford convention travel expenses.\n\n**Role-playing**\n\nFurries engage in role-playing, which can range from simple scenarios to complex, multi-character storylines. This aspect of the fandom is often referred to as \"fursona\" or \"fur-persona,\" where individuals create a fictional character that they embody in their online and offline interactions. Role-playing can be done in various forms, including text-based, voice-based, or even live-action. It allows furries to explore different personalities, traits, and scenarios in a safe and creative environment.\n\n**Conventions**\n\nSufficient interest and membership has enabled the creation of many furry conventions in North America and Europe. A furry convention is for the fans to get together to buy and sell artwork, participate in workshops, wear costumes, and socialize. Anthrocon, in 2008, the largest furry convention with more than 5,861 attendees, is estimated to have generated approximately $3 million to Pittsburgh's economy that year. Another convention, Further Confusion, held in San Jose each January, closely follows Anthrocon in scale and attendance. Midwest FurFest is the world's largest furry convention, with a self-reported 2019 attendance of 11,019.\n\n**Websites and online communities**\n\nThe internet contains a multitude of furry websites and online communities, such as art community websites Fur Affinity, Inkbunny, SoFurry and Weasyl; and WikiFur, a collaborative furry wiki. These platforms provide a space for furries to share their art, stories, and ideas, as well as connect with others who share similar interests.\n\n**IT industry and tech**\n\nIt is often suggested that \"furries run the internet,\" as members of the furry community are overrepresented in the IT industry, often in senior or other important positions. This is likely due to the community's emphasis on creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills.\n\n**Furry lifestyle**\n\nThe phrases furry lifestyle and furry lifestyler first appeared in July 1996 on the newsgroup alt.fan.furry during an ongoing dispute within the online community. The Usenet newsgroup was created to accommodate discussion beyond furry art and literature, and to resolve disputes concerning what should or should not be associated with the fandom; its members quickly adopted the term furry lifestylers, and still consider the fandom and the lifestyle to be separate social entities. They have defined and adopted an alternative meaning of the word furry specific to this group: \"a person with an important emotional/spiritual connection with an animal or animals, real, fictional, or symbolic.\"\n\n**Sexual aspects**\n\nAccording to four different surveys, 14–25% of the fandom members report homosexuality, 37–52% bisexuality, 28–51% heterosexuality, and 3–8% other forms of alternative sexual relationships. Approximately half of the respondents reported being in a relationship, of which 76% were in a relationship with another member of the furry fandom. Examples of sexual aspects within the furry fandom include erotic art and furry-themed cybersex. The term \"yiff\" is sometimes used to indicate sexual activity or sexual material within the fandom—this applies to sexual activity and interaction within the subculture whether in the form of cybersex or offline.\n\n**Public perception and media coverage**\n\nEarly portrayal of the furries in magazines such as Wired, Loaded, Vanity Fair, and the syndicated sex column Savage Love focused mainly on the sexual aspect of the furry fandom. Fictional portrayals of the furry fandom have appeared in television shows such as The Simpsons, ER, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, The Drew Carey Show, Sex2K on MTV, Entourage, 1000 Ways to Die, Tosh.0, Check It Out! with Dr Steve Brule, and 30 Rock. Most furry fans claim that media portrayals are misconceptions, while more recent coverage focuses on addressing the myths and stereotypes that have come to be associated with the furry fandom.\n\n**Sociological aspects**\n\nThe International Anthropomorphic Research Project (IARP), a team of social scientists, has been collecting data on the furry fandom. Their 2016 publication collects several peer-reviewed and self-published studies into a single volume. Among their findings were that the average adult furry is between 23 and 27 years of age, with more than 75% of furries being 25 years of age or younger, and 88% of adult furries being under the age of 30. Minors were not included in the study for professional ethics reasons. IARP estimated that 20% were under the age of 18. 67.1% of furries identified themselves as male on the surveys, while 23.3% identified as female. 2% of furries identified themselves as transgender, and 10% of furries identified themselves as genderqueer/non-binary. 83–90% of furries self-identify as White, with small minorities of furries self-identifying as Asian (2–4%), Black (2–3%), and Hispanic (3%). 21% of furries consider themselves to be bronies, 44% consider themselves to be anime fans, and 11% consider themselves sport fans. Furries, as a group, are more politically liberal and less religious than the average American or other comparable fan groups such as anime fans, while still containing groups such as neo-Nazis and alt-right activists. 23.5% of furries self-identified as Christian, 16.8% as atheist, 16.8% as agnostic, 11.0% as Pagan/Wiccan, 2.4% as Buddhist, 1.2% as Jewish, 1.1% as Deist, 0.9% as Satanist, and 26.2% as \"other\" (including \"participants who had their own belief systems, were undecided, refused to answer, or had uncommon belief systems\"). Approximately 70% of adult furries have either completed, or are currently completing post-secondary education.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Furry_fandom\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1976, cartoonists Ken Fletcher and Reed Waller created the amateur press association Vootie, which was dedicated to animal-focused art [5] Many of its featured works contained adult themes, such as \"Omaha\" the Cat Dancer, which contained explicit sex [6] [7] Vootie grew a small following over the next several years, and its contributors began meeting at science fiction and comics conventions.\n\n\nInspiration\nAllegorical novels, including works of both science fiction and fantasy, and cartoons featuring anthropomorphic animals are often cited as the earliest inspiration for the fandom [8] A survey conducted in 2007 suggested that, when compared with a non-furry control group, a higher proportion of those identifying as furries liked cartoons \"a great deal\" as children and recalled watching them significantly more often, as well as being more likely to enjoy works of science fiction than those outside of the community [15]\n\n\nActivities\nAccording to a survey from 2008, most furries believe that visual art, conventions, literature, and online communities are strongly important to the fandom [16] The furry fandom is male-dominated, with surveys reporting around 80% male respondents [17] [16] [18]\n\n\nCrafts\nFans with craft skills create plush toys, and also build elaborate costumes called fursuits, [19] which are worn for fun or to participate in parades, convention masquerades, dances, or fund-raising charity events (as entertainers) [20] Fursuits range from designs featuring simple construction resembling some entertainment and sports mascots [15] to those with more sophisticated features such as moving jaw mechanisms, animatronic parts, prosthetic makeup, and other features Fursuits range in price from $500, for mascot-like designs, to an upwards of $10,000 for models incorporating animatronics [21] About 80% of furries do not own a full fursuit [15] [16] [17] Some fans may also wear \"partial\" suits consisting simply of ears and a tail, or a head, paws, and a tail [15] A much larger proportion of individuals who attend conventions own a full or partial fursuit—45%, according to a survey done at Anthrocon 2018—which has been attributed to convention attendees' generally higher likelihood to be able to afford to buy a fursuit if they can afford convention travel expenses [22]\n\n\nRole-playing\n\n\n\nConventions\nSufficient interest and membership has enabled the creation of many furry conventions in North America and Europe A furry convention is for the fans to get together to buy and sell artwork, participate in workshops, wear costumes, and socialize [30] Anthrocon, in 2008, the largest furry convention with more than 5,861 attendees, [31] is estimated to have generated approximately $3 million to Pittsburgh's economy that year [32] Another convention, Further Confusion, held in San Jose each January, closely follows Anthrocon in scale and attendance $470,000 was raised in conventions for charity from 2000 to 2009 [33] As of December 2022, Midwest FurFest is the world's largest furry convention [34] [35] [36] It had a self-reported 2019 attendance of 11,019 [37]\n\n\nWebsites and online communities\nThe internet contains a multitude of furry websites and online communities, such as art community websites Fur Affinity, Inkbunny, SoFurry and Weasyl; and WikiFur, a collaborative furry wiki [38] [failed verification]\n\n\nIT industry and tech\nIt is often suggested that \"furries run the internet\", as members of the furry community are overrepresented in the IT industry, often in senior or other important positions [56] [57]\n\n\nFurry lifestyle\nThe phrases furry lifestyle and furry lifestyler first appeared in July 1996 on the newsgroup alt.fan.furry during an ongoing dispute within the online community The Usenet newsgroup was created to accommodate discussion beyond furry art and literature, and to resolve disputes concerning what should or should not be associated with the fandom; its members quickly adopted the term furry lifestylers, and still consider the fandom and the lifestyle to be separate social entities They have defined and adopted an alternative meaning of the word furry specific to this group: \"a person with an important emotional/spiritual connection with an animal or animals, real, fictional, or symbolic.\" [58]\n\n\nSexual aspects\nAccording to four different surveys, 14–25% of the fandom members report homosexuality, 37–52% bisexuality, 28–51% heterosexuality, and 3–8% other forms of alternative sexual relationships [17] [18] [60] [61] Approximately half of the respondents reported being in a relationship, of which 76% were in a relationship with another member of the furry fandom [17] Examples of sexual aspects within the furry fandom include erotic art and furry-themed cybersex [62] [63] The term \"yiff\" is sometimes used to indicate sexual activity or sexual material within the fandom—this applies to sexual activity and interaction within the subculture whether in the form of cybersex or offline [64] [65]\n\n\nPublic perception and media coverage\nEarly portrayal of the furries in magazines such as Wired, [67] Loaded, [68] Vanity Fair, [69] and the syndicated sex column Savage Love focused mainly on the sexual aspect of the furry fandom Fictional portrayals of the furry fandom have appeared in television shows such as The Simpsons, [70] [71] ER, [72] CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, [73] The Drew Carey Show, [74] Sex2K on MTV, [75] Entourage, [76] 1000 Ways to Die, [77] Tosh.0, [78] [79] Check It Out! with Dr Steve Brule, [80] and 30 Rock [81] Most furry fans claim that media portrayals are misconceptions, [82] [83] while more recent coverage focuses on addressing the myths and stereotypes that have come to be associated with the furry fandom [84] A reporter attending Anthrocon 2006 noted that \"despite their wild image from Vanity Fair, MTV and CSI, furry conventions aren't about kinky sex between weirdos gussied up in foxy costumes\", that conference attendees were \"not having sex more than the rest of us\", [85] and that the furry convention was about \"people talking and drawing animals and comic-book characters in sketchbooks.\" [64] In October 2007, a Hartford Advocate reporter attended FurFright 2007 undercover because of media restrictions She learned that the restrictions were intended to prevent misinformation, and reported that the scandalous behavior she had expected was not present [86] Recent coverage of the furry fandom has been more balanced According to Ian Wolf, a 2009 article from the BBC entitled \"Who are the furries?\" was the first piece of journalism to be nominated for an Ursa Major Award, the main award given in the field of anthropomorphism [13] [87] [88]\n\n\nSociological aspects\nThe International Anthropomorphic Research Project (IARP), a team of social scientists, has been collecting data on the furry fandom Their 2016 publication collects several peer-reviewed and self-published studies into a single volume [98] [99] Among their findings were that the average adult furry is between 23 and 27 years of age, with more than 75% of furries being 25 years of age or younger, and 88% of adult furries being under the age of 30 Minors were not included in the study for professional ethics reasons IARP estimated that 20% were under the age of 18 [99]: 4–7  67.1% of furries identified themselves as male on the surveys, while 23.3% identified as female 2% of furries identified themselves as transgender, and 10% of furries identified themselves as genderqueer/non-binary [99]: 10–11  83–90% of furries self-identify as White, with small minorities of furries self-identifying as Asian (2–4%), Black (2–3%), and Hispanic (3%) [99]: 7–10  21% of furries consider themselves to be bronies, 44% consider themselves to be anime fans, and 11% consider themselves sport fans [99]: 32–33  Furries, as a group, are more politically liberal and less religious than the average American or other comparable fan groups such as anime fans, [99]: 18  while still containing groups such as neo-Nazis and alt-right activists [100] 23.5% of furries self-identified as Christian, 16.8% as atheist, 16.8% as agnostic, 11.0% as Pagan/Wiccan, 2.4% as Buddhist, 1.2% as Jewish, 1.1% as Deist, 0.9% as Satanist, and 26.2% as \"other\" (including \"participants who had their own belief systems, were undecided, refused to answer, or had uncommon belief systems\") [99]: 16  Approximately 70% of adult furries have either completed, or are currently completing post-secondary education [99]: 12 \n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the third installment in the Jurassic World trilogy and the sixth film in the Jurassic Park franchise.\n\n## Plot\n\nFour years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the world is faced with a new threat as dinosaurs roam free on Earth. Amidst the chaos, Biosyn Genetics, a biotech company, establishes a dinosaur preserve in Italy's Dolomites to conduct genomics research. The company's goal is to harness the genetic secrets of dinosaurs for pharmacological applications.\n\nThe film follows Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), and Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) as they navigate the new world where dinosaurs and humans coexist. The story unfolds as they uncover a sinister plot by Biosyn to exploit the dinosaurs for their own gain.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Chris Pratt as Owen Grady\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing\n* Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood\n* Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm\n* Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler\n* Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant\n* Justice Smith as Franklin Webb\n* Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia Rodriguez\n* DeWanda Wise as Kayla Watts\n* Mamoudou Athie as Dr. Charles Remy\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDuring early conversations about Jurassic World (2015), executive producer Steven Spielberg told director Colin Trevorrow that he was interested in having more films made. In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that sequels to Jurassic World had been discussed. He said that they wanted to create something \"less arbitrary and episodic\", which could \"potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story.\"\n\n### Pre-production\n\nUniversal announced in February 2018 that the untitled film, known then as Jurassic World 3, would be released on June 11, 2021. It was also announced that Trevorrow would write the script with Emily Carmichael, based on a story by Trevorrow and writing partner, Derek Connolly. Like the previous films, Marshall and Patrick Crowley would be producers, and Trevorrow and Spielberg would return as executive producers.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in British Columbia on February 24, and the film's title was announced the following day as Jurassic World Dominion. Canadian filming ended in early March 2020, and production moved to England, where a major location was Pinewood Studios. Filming was also done in Malta.\n\n### Locations and sets\n\nTrevorrow wanted the film to take place in locations not previously featured in the series, including Malta and the Dolomites. Location shooting was preferred to sets, and blue screens were rarely used. Jurassic World Dominion is the first film in the franchise with dinosaurs in a snowy environment.\n\n## Creatures on screen\n\nJurassic World Dominion features 35 dinosaur species, including the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor, and Triceratops. The film uses more animatronic dinosaurs than the previous Jurassic World films did. 18 animatronics of various sizes were created for the film by designer John Nolan.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's music was composed by Michael Giacchino, who scored the previous Jurassic World films. It was recorded at England's Abbey Road Studios over a 10-day period. Like his previous Jurassic World scores, Giacchino incorporated themes from John Williams's earlier Jurassic Park soundtracks.\n\n## Marketing\n\nA five-minute preview of the film was released in June 2021 with IMAX screenings of F9. The footage was posted online on November 23, 2021, as a standalone short film and prologue for Jurassic World Dominion.\n\n## Release\n\nJurassic World Dominion premiered in Mexico City on May 23, 2022, and began its theatrical rollout on June 1 in Mexico and South Korea. In the United States, Dominion was released theatrically by Universal Pictures on June 10.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film was released for digital purchase and rental on July 14, 2022, and was released on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 16. The home video release includes an extended version of Jurassic World Dominion with the 14 minutes of cut footage restored.\n\n## Reception\n\nJurassic World Dominion grossed $376.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $626.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.004 billion. It is the third-highest-grossing film of 2022 and was the 50th film to pass the billion-dollar mark. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $229.7 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs. Forbes calculated the net profit for Universal to be $235.5 million.\n\n## Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 29% of 404 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.70/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Jurassic World Dominion might be a bit of an improvement over its immediate predecessors in some respects, but this franchise has lumbered a long way down from its classic start.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 38 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. It is the lowest-rated film of the series on both websites.\n\n## Accolades\n\nJurassic World Dominion concludes the second film trilogy and the storyline which began in the original trilogy. In January 2022, Marshall did not rule out the possibility of future films. \"We're going to sit down, and we're going to see what the future is,\" he said.\n\n## Future\n\nJurassic World Dominion concludes the second film trilogy and the storyline which began in the original trilogy.

father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a leading figure in the Indian movement for independence from British rule, and became the first Prime Minister of the Dominion (and later Republic) of India [14] Indira was her parents' only surviving child (she had a younger brother who died while young); [15] she grew up with her mother, Kamala Nehru, at the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad [16] In 1930, the Nehru family donated the mansion to the Indian National Congress and renamed it Swaraj Bhavan (meaning abode of freedom) A new mansion was built nearby to serve as the family residence and given the name of the old Anand Bhavan [16] Indira had a lonely and unhappy childhood [17] Her father was often away, directing political activities or incarcerated, while her mother was frequently bedridden with illness and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis [18] Indira had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters [19]\n\n\nFirst, second and third term as prime minister between 1966 and 1977\nGandhi's first eleven years serving as prime minister saw her evolve from the perception of Congress party leaders as their puppet, to a strong leader with the iron resolve to split the party over her policy positions, or to go to war with Pakistan to assist Bangladesh in the 1971 liberation war At the end of 1977, she was such a dominating figure in Indian politics that Congress party president D K Barooah had coined the phrase \"India is Indira and Indira is India.\" [42]\n\n\nFirst year\nGandhi formed her government with Morarji Desai as deputy prime minister and finance minister At the beginning of her first term as prime minister, she was widely criticised by the media and the opposition as a \"Goongi goodiya\" (Hindi for a \"dumb doll\") of the Congress party bosses who had orchestrated her election and then tried to constrain her [43] [44]\nIndira was a reluctant successor to her famed father, although she had accompanied him on several official foreign visits and played an anchor role in bringing down the first democratically elected communist government in Kerala [45] According to certain sources it was the socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia that first derided her personality as the \"Goongi Goodiya\" (Hindi for \"dumb doll\") that later was echoed by other Congress politicians who were wary of her rise in the party [46]\n\n\n1967–1971\nThe first electoral test for Gandhi was the 1967 general elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha after these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis Gandhi was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Raebareli constituency She had a rocky start after agreeing to devalue the rupee which created hardship for Indian businesses and consumers The importation of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes [49]\n\n\nMilitary conflict with China\nIn 1967, a military conflict alongside the border of the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim, then an Indian protectorate, broke out between India and China India won by repelling Chinese attacks and forced the subsequent withdrawal of Chinese forces from the region [2] Throughout the conflict, the Indian losses were 88 killed and 163 wounded while Chinese casualties stood at 340 killed and 450 wounded, according to the Indian Defense Ministry [55] Chinese sources made no declarations of casualties but alleged India to be the aggressor [56] [57]\n\n\n1971–1977\nGaribi Hatao (Remove Poverty) was the resonant theme for Gandhi's 1971 political bid The slogan was developed in response to the combined opposition alliance's use of the two-word manifesto—\"Indira Hatao\" (Remove Indira) [61] [62] [63] The Garibi Hatao slogan and the proposed anti-poverty programs that came with it were designed to give Gandhi independent national support, based on the rural and urban poor This would allow her to bypass the dominant rural castes both in and of state and local governments as well as the urban commercial class For their part, the previously voiceless poor would at last gain both political worth and political weight [63] The programs created through Garibi Hatao, though carried out locally, were funded and developed by the Central Government in New Delhi The program was supervised and staffed by the Indian National Congress party \"These programs also provided the central political leadership with new and vast patronage resources to be disbursed .. throughout the country.\" [64]\n\n\nWar with Pakistan\nGandhi's biggest achievement following the 1971 election came in December 1971 with India's decisive victory over Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War That victory occurred in the last two weeks of the Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to the formation of independent Bangladesh An insurgency in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) formed in early 1971, with Bengali's and East Pakistanis revolting against authoritarian rule from the central West Pakistan Government In response, Pakistani security forces launched the infamous Operation Searchlight, in which Pakistan committed genocide among Bengali Hindus, nationalists and intelligentsia Gandhi's India was initially restrained from intervening in the insurgency but quickly started to support Bengali rebels through the provision of military supplies Indian forces clashed multiple times with Pakistani forces in the Eastern border At one point, Indian forces along with Mukti Bahini rebels allied together and attacked Pakistani forces at Dhalai The attack, supported and later successfully executed by India, was done to stop Pakistani cross-border shelling The battle occurred more than a month before India's official intervention in December Gandhi quickly dispatched more troops to the Eastern border with East Pakistan, hoping to support Mukti Bahini rebels and cease any Pakistani infiltration Indian forces then clashed again with Pakistani forces after Indian forces crossed the border and secured Garibpur after a one-day battle lasting from 20 November 1971 to the 21st The next day, on 22 November, Indian and Pakistani aircraft engaged in a dogfight over the Boyra Salient, in which thousands of people watched as 4 Indian Folland Gnats shot down 2 Pakistani Canadair Sabres and damaged another Both Pakistani pilots that were shot down were captured as prisoners of war The Battle of Boyra instantly made the 4 Indian pilots celebrities and created large-scale nationalism as the Bangladesh Liberation War saw more and more Indian intervention and escalation Other clashes also happened on the same day but did not receive as much media attention as did the battle of Boyra and Garibpur On 3 December 1971, the Pakistan Air Force launched Operation Chengiz Khan, which saw Pakistani aircraft attacking Indian airbases and military installations across the Western border in a pre-emptive strike The initial night-time attack by Pakistani forces was foiled, failing to inflict any major damage on Indian airbases, allowing Indian aircraft to counterattack into West Pakistan Gandhi quickly declared a state of emergency and addressed the nation on radio shortly after midnight, stating: \"We must be prepared for a long period of hardship and sacrifice.\"\n\n\nVerdict on electoral malpractice\nOn 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court declared Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on the grounds of electoral malpractice In an election petition filed by her 1971 opponent, Raj Narain (who later defeated her in the 1977 parliamentary election running in the Raebareli constituency), alleged several major as well as minor instances of the use of government resources for campaigning [72] [73] Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Ashoke Kumar Sen, to defend her in court [74] She gave evidence in her defence during the trial After almost four years, the court found her guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes [72] [75]  The judge, however, rejected the more serious charges of bribery, laid against her in the case [72]\n\n\nState of Emergency (1975–1977)\nGandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest Her Cabinet and government recommended that then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a state of emergency because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975 [77] At the time of emergency, there was a widespread rumour that Gandhi had ordered her search guards to eliminate firebrand trade unionist and socialist party leader George Fernandes, while he was on a run Few International organisations and Government officials issued request letters to Indira Gandhi pleading her to relinquish such decrees Fernandes had called a nationwide railway strike in 1974, that shut the railways for three weeks and became the largest industrial action in Asia Ghandhi had turned furious over him and the strike was massively cracked down [78]\n\n\nRule by decree\nWithin a few months, President's rule was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party [79] Police were granted powers to impose curfews and detain citizens indefinitely; all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were postponed indefinitely, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on the recommendation of the state's governor [80]\n\n\nRise of Sanjay Gandhi\nDuring the emergency Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, entered into Indian politics He wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any government office According to Mark Tully, \"His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state.\" [83] It was said that during the emergency Sanjay virtually ran India along with his friends, especially Bansi Lal [84] It was also quipped that Sanjay had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office) [85] [86] [87]\n\n\n1977 election and opposition years\nIn 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Indira Gandhi called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule She may have grossly misjudged her popularity by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her [88] She was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties The alliance was made up of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and Charan Singh's Bharatiya Kranti Dal representing northern peasants and farmers The Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977; veteran Gandhi supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD (Congress for Democracy) due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that The Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted The alliance parties later merged to form the Janata Party under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan The other leaders of the Janata Party were Charan Singh, Raj Narain, George Fernandes, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee [89]\n\n\nIn opposition and return to power\nSince Indira Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed Yashwantrao Chavan as their parliamentary party leader Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira She won a by-election in the Chikmagalur Constituency and took a seat in the Lok Sabha in November 1978 [91] [92] after the Janata Party's attempts to have Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar run against her failed when he refused to contest the election saying he wanted to remain apolitical [93] However, the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh, ordered her arrest along with Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court The arrest meant that Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament The allegations included that she \"had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency\" [94] However, the strategy backfired disastrously In response to her arrest, Gandhi's supporters hijacked an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release [95] Her arrest and long-running trial gained her sympathy from many people The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her) The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists, and former Congress party members With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting In 1979, the government began to unravel over the issue of the dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)—the Hindu nationalist, [96] [97] paramilitary [98] organisation The ambitious Union finance minister, Charan Singh, who as the Union home minister during the previous year had ordered the Gandhi's' arrests, took advantage of this and started courting Indira and Sanjay After a significant exodus from the party to Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979 Singh was appointed prime minister, by President Reddy, after Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress (I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions [99] [100] The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay Since Singh refused to drop them, Congress (I) withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979 [101]\n\n\n1980 elections and fourth term\nThe Congress Party under Gandhi swept back into power in January 1980 [104] In this election, Gandhi was elected by the voters of the Medak constituency [105] On 23 June, Sanjay Gandhi was killed in a plane crash while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre in New Delhi [106] In 1980, as a tribute to her son's dream of launching an indigenously manufactured car, Indira Gandhi nationalized Sanjay's debt-ridden company, Maruti Udyog, for Rs 43,000,000 (4.34 crore) and invited joint venture bids from automobile companies around the world Suzuki of Japan was selected as the partner The company launched its first Indian-manufactured car in 1984 [107]\n\n\nOperation Blue Star\nAfter the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the Sikh-majority Akali Dal came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab In an effort to split the Akali Dal and gain popular support among the Sikhs, Gandhi's Congress Party helped to bring the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to prominence in Punjab politics [111] [112] Later, Bhindranwale's organisation, Damdami Taksal, became embroiled in violence with another religious sect called the Sant Nirankari Mission and he was accused of instigating the murder of Jagat Narain, the owner of the Punjab Kesari newspaper [113] After being arrested, Bhindranwale disassociated himself from the Congress Party and joined Akali Dal [114] In July 1982, he led the campaign for the implementation of the Anandpur Resolution, which demanded greater autonomy for the Sikh-majority state Meanwhile, a small group of Sikhs, including some of Bhindranwale's followers, turned to militancy after being targeted by government officials and police for supporting the Anandpur Resolution [115] In 1982, Bhindranwale and approximately 200 armed followers moved into a guest house called the Guru Nanak Niwas near the Golden Temple [116]\n\n\nAssassination\n\"I am alive today, I may not be there tomorrow .. I shall continue to serve until my last breath and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it  .. Even if I died in the service of the nation, I would be proud of it Every drop of my blood .. will contribute to the growth of this nation and to make it strong and dynamic.\"\n\n\nInternational reaction\nGandhi's death was mourned worldwide World leaders condemned the assassination and said her death would leave a 'big emptiness' in international affairs In Moscow, Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko sent condolences, \"The Soviet people learned with pain and sorrow about the untimely death in a villainous assassination of the glorious daughter of the great Indian people, a fiery fighter for peace and security of peoples and a great friend of the Soviet Union\" President Ronald Reagan, along with Secretary of State George Shultz, visited the Indian Embassy to sign a book of condolences and expressed his 'shock, revulsion, and grief' over the assassination 42nd vice president of the United States Walter Mondale called Gandhi 'a great leader of a great democracy' and deplored 'this shocking act of violence' Asian, African, and European leaders mourned Gandhi as a great champion of democracy and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its 'deepest grief' and called the killing a 'terrorist' act South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, said Gandhi's death meant the 'loss of a great leader to the whole world.' Yugoslav President Veselin Đuranović, Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, Italian President Sandro Pertini, Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, and French President François Mitterrand condemned the killing At the United Nations, the General Assembly paused during its work as shocked delegates mourned the death Assembly President Paul Lusaka of Zambia postponed a scheduled debate and hastily organized a memorial meeting [139]\n\n\nForeign relations\nGandhi is remembered for her ability to effectively promote Indian foreign policy measures [140] [141] [142]\n\n\nSouth Asia\nIn early 1971, disputed elections in Pakistan led then East Pakistan to declare independence as Bangladesh Repression and violence by the Pakistani army led to 10 million refugees crossing the border into India over the following months [143] Finally, in December 1971, Gandhi intervened directly in the conflict to liberate Bangladesh India emerged victorious following the war with Pakistan to become the dominant power of South Asia [144] India had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union promising mutual assistance in the case of war, [143] while Pakistan received active support from the United States during the conflict [145] U.S President Richard Nixon disliked Gandhi personally, referring to her as a \"bitch\" [146] and a \"clever fox\" in his private communication with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [147] Nixon later wrote of the war: \" [Gandhi] suckered  [America] Suckered us .. this woman suckered us.\" [148] Relations with the U.S became distant as Gandhi developed closer ties with the Soviet Union after the war The latter grew to become India's largest trading partner and its biggest arms supplier for much of Gandhi's premiership [149] India's new hegemonic position, as articulated under the \"Indira Doctrine\", led to attempts to bring the Himalayan states under India's sphere of influence [150] Nepal and Bhutan remained aligned with India, while in 1975, after years of campaigning, Sikkim voted to join India in a referendum [59] [151]\n\n\nMiddle East\nGandhi remained a staunch supporter of the Palestinians in the Arab–Israeli conflict and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States [158] Israel was viewed as a religious state, and thus an analogue to India's archrival Pakistan Indian diplomats hoped to win Arab support in countering Pakistan in Kashmir Nevertheless, Gandhi authorised the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s Her lieutenant, P V Narasimha Rao, later became prime minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992 [165]\n\n\nAsia-Pacific\nOne of the major developments in Southeast Asia during Gandhi's premiership was the formation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967 Relations between ASEAN and India were mutually antagonistic India perceived ASEAN to be linked to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and, therefore, it was seen as a pro-American organisation On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the Viet Cong and India's strong links with the USSR Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971 India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 also contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia [170] Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the ZOPFAN declaration and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region Nevertheless, Gandhi's close relations with reunified Vietnam and her decision to recognize the Vietnam-installed Government of Cambodia in 1980 meant that India and ASEAN were unable to develop a viable partnership [170]\n\n\nAfrica\nAlthough independent India was initially viewed as a champion of various African independence movements, its cordial relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations and its liberal views of British policies in East Africa had harmed its image as a staunch supporter of various independence movements in the third world [172] Indian condemnation of militant struggles in Kenya and Algeria was in sharp contrast to China, who had supported armed struggle to win African independence [172] After reaching a high diplomatic point in the aftermath of Nehru's role in the Suez Crisis, India's isolation from Africa was almost complete when only four nations—Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Libya—supported her during the Sino-Indian War in 1962 [172] After Gandhi became prime minister, diplomatic and economic relations with the states which had sided with India during the Sino-Indian War were expanded [172] Gandhi began negotiations with the Kenyan government to establish the Africa-India Development Cooperation The Indian government also started considering the possibility of bringing Indians settled in Africa within the framework of its policy goals to help recover its declining geo-strategic influence Gandhi declared the people of Indian origin settled in Africa as \"Ambassadors of India\" [172] Efforts to rope in the Asian community to join Indian diplomacy, however, came to naught, in part because of the unwillingness of Indians to remain in politically insecure surroundings, and because of the exodus of African Indians to Britain with the passing of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1968 [172] In Uganda, the African Indian community suffered persecution and eventually expulsion under the government of Idi Amin [173]\n\n\nThe Commonwealth\nThe Commonwealth is a voluntary association of mainly former British colonies India maintained cordial relations with most of the members during Gandhi's time in power In the 1980s, she along with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, Zambia's president Kenneth Kaunda, Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew was regarded as being one of the pillars of the Commonwealth [175] India under Gandhi also hosted the 1983 Commonwealth Heads of Government summit in New Delhi Gandhi used the meetings as a forum to put pressure on member countries to cut economic, sports, and cultural ties with apartheid South Africa [176]\n\n\nThe Non-aligned Movement\nIn the early 1980s under Gandhi, India attempted to reassert its prominent role in the Non-Aligned Movement by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development By appealing to the economic grievances of developing countries, Gandhi and her successors exercised a moderating influence on the Non-aligned movement, diverting it from some of the Cold War issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting where Cuban leader Fidel Castro attempted to steer the movement towards the Soviet Union [177] Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the movement, its close relations with the Soviet Union and its pro-Soviet positions on Afghanistan and Cambodia limited its influence [178]\n\n\nWestern Europe\nGandhi spent a number of years in Europe during her youth and had formed many friendships there During her premiership she formed friendships with many leaders including West German chancellor, Willy Brandt [179] and Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky [180] She enjoyed a close working relationship with many British leaders including conservative premiers, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher [181]\n\n\nSoviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries\nThe relationship between India and the Soviet Union deepened during Gandhi's rule The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and China, rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner [182]\n\n\nSoviet intelligence in India\nSoviet intelligence was involved in India during Indira Gandhi's administration, sometimes at Gandhi's expense In the prelude to Operation Blue Star, by 1981, the Soviets had launched Operation Kontakt, which was based on a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by the ISI to Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country [183] In November 1982, Yuri Andropov, the General Secretary of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet Union, approved a proposal to fabricate Pakistani intelligence documents detailing ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state [184] Indira Gandhi's decision to move troops into the Punjab was based on her taking seriously the information provided by the Soviets regarding secret CIA support for the Sikhs [185]\n\n\nUnited States\nWhen Gandhi came to power in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US president At the time, India was reliant on the US for food aid Gandhi resented the US policy of food aid being used as a tool to force India to adopt policies favoured by the US She also resolutely refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Relations with the US were strained badly under President Richard Nixon and his favouring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war Nixon despised Gandhi politically and personally [195] In 1981, Gandhi met President Ronald Reagan for the first time at the North–South Summit held to discuss global poverty She had been described to him as an 'Ogre', but he found her charming and easy to work with and they formed a close working relationship during her premiership in the 1980s [196]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nGandhi presided over three Five-Year Plans as prime minister, two of which succeeded in meeting their targeted growth [197]\n\n\nGreen Revolution and the Fourth Five-Year Plan\nGandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence [49] [53] The government responded by taking steps to liberalise the economy and agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid [49] The economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966–1969 [200] [208] Much of that growth however, was offset by the fact that the external aid promised by the United States government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), meant to ease the short-run costs of adjustment to a liberalised economy, never materialised [49] American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy At the same time, Indo-US relations were strained because of Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam While it was thought at the time, and for decades after, that President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb [209] [210] In light of the circumstances, liberalisation became politically suspect and was soon abandoned [49] Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India After the bitter experience with Johnson, Gandhi decided not to request food aid in the future Moreover, her government resolved never again to become \"so vulnerably dependent\" on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves [211] When food stocks slumped after poor harvests in 1972, the government made it a point to use foreign exchange to buy US wheat commercially rather than seek resumption of food aid [212]\n\n\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974–1979) was enacted with the backdrop of the state of emergency and the Twenty Point Program of 1975 [200] It was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act which has often been justified on economic grounds [200] In contrast to the reception of Gandhi's earlier economic plan, this one was criticised for being a \"hastily thrown together wish list.\" [200] She promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide-ranging social and economic reforms In addition, the government targeted an annual growth rate of 4.4% over the period of the plan [197]\n\n\nOperation Forward and the Sixth Five-Year Plan\nGandhi inherited a weak economy when she became prime minister again in 1980 [216] The preceding year—1979–80—under the Janata Party government saw the strongest recession (−5.2%) in the history of modern India with inflation rampant at 18.2% [53] [215] [217] Gandhi proceeded to abrogate the Janata Party government's Five-Year Plan in 1980 and launched the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980–85) Her government targeted an average growth rate of 5.2% over the period of the plan [197] Measures to check inflation were also taken; by the early 1980s it was under control at an annual rate of about 5% [217]\n\n\nInflation and unemployment\nDuring Lal Bahadur Shastri's last full year in office (1965), inflation averaged 7.7%, compared to 5.2% at the end of Gandhi's first term in office (1977) [220] On average, inflation in India had remained below 7% through the 1950s and 1960s [221] It then accelerated sharply in the 1970s, from 5.5% in 1970–71 to over 20% by 1973–74, due to the international oil crisis [220] Gandhi declared inflation the gravest of problems in 1974 (at 25.2%) and devised a severe anti-inflation program The government was successful in bringing down inflation during the emergency; achieving negative figures of −1.1% by the end of 1975–76 [216] [220]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nDespite the provisions, control and regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India had continued to be owned and operated by private persons [223] Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies and ignoring priority sector lending Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority of the population) unbanked [224] After becoming prime minister, Gandhi expressed her intention of nationalising the banks to alleviate poverty in a paper titled, \"Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation\" [225] The paper received overwhelming public support [225] In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks After this, public sector bank branch deposits increased by approximately 800 percent; advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent [226] Nationalisation also resulted in significant growth in the geographic coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in unbanked, rural areas The nationalisation drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small- and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base [227] Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, solidly praised her nationalisation of banks [224]\n\n\nNationalisation\nDespite the provisions, control and regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India had continued to be owned and operated by private persons [223] Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies and ignoring priority sector lending Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority of the

[227] Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, solidly praised her nationalisation of banks [224]\n\n\nAdministration\nIn 1966, Gandhi accepted the demands of the Akalis to reorganise Punjab on linguistic lines The Hindi-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, Haryana, while the Pahari speaking hilly areas in the northeast were joined to Himachal Pradesh [231] By this action she had hoped to ward off the growing political conflict between Hindu and Sikh groups in the region [231] However, a contentious issue that was

[232]\n\n\nSocial reform\nThe principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women was enshrined in the Indian Constitution under the Gandhi administration [235]\n\n\nLanguage policy\nUnder the 1950 Constitution of India, Hindi was to be the official national language by 1965 That was unacceptable to many non-Hindi-speaking states which wanted the continued use of English in government In 1967, Gandhi introduced a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages It established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi-speaking Indian states [205] She thus put herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision [237] Nevertheless, critics alleged that her stance was actually meant to weaken the position of rival Congress leaders from the northern states such as Uttar Pradesh, where there had been strong, sometimes violent, pro-Hindi agitations [205] Gandhi came out of the language conflicts with the strong support of the south Indian populace [237]\n\n\nNational security\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, Gandhi had the Indian army crush militant Communist uprisings in the Indian state of West Bengal [238] The communist insurgency in India was completely suppressed during the state of emergency [239] [240] [241]\n\n\nIndia's nuclear programme\nGandhi contributed to and carried out further, the vision of Jawaharlal Nehru, the former premier of India, to develop its nuclear program [248] [249] Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to Test No 6 by the People's Republic of China Gandhi saw the test as Chinese nuclear intimidation and promoted Nehru's views to establish India's stability and security interests independent from those of the nuclear superpowers [250]\n\n\nPersonal life\nShe married Feroze Gandhi at the age of 25, in 1942 Their marriage lasted 18 years until he died of a heart attack in 1960 [254] [255] They had two sons—Rajiv and Sanjay Initially, her younger son Sanjay had been her chosen heir, but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Indira Gandhi persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981 Rajiv took office as prime minister following his mother's assassination in 1984; he served until December 1989 Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber working on behalf of LTTE on 21 May 1991 [256]\n\n\nViews on women\nIn 1952 in a letter to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: \"I am in no sense a feminist, but I believe in women being able to do everything.. Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.\" While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi's complex feelings toward her gender and feminism [257] Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality \"Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said she hardly knew the difference between a boy and a girl until the age of twelve.\" [258] [259]\n\n\nState honours\nAmerican veteran politician Henry A Kissinger had described Indira Gandhi as being an \"Iron lady\", [277] [278] [279] a nickname that became associated with her tough personality [278] [279] [277] After leading India to victory against Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, President V V Giri awarded Gandhi with India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna [280] [281] [282] In 2011, the Bangladesh Freedom Honour, Bangladesh's highest civilian award for foreign nationals, was posthumously conferred on Gandhi for her \"outstanding contributions\" to Bangladesh's Liberation War [283]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmerican veteran politician Henry A Kissinger had described Indira Gandhi as being an \"Iron lady\", [277] [278] [279] a nickname that became associated with her tough personality [278] [279] [277] After leading India to victory against Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, President V V Giri awarded Gandhi with India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna [280] [281] [282] In 2011, the Bangladesh Freedom Honour, Bangladesh's highest civilian award for foreign nationals, was posthumously conferred on Gandhi for her \"outstanding contributions\" to Bangladesh's Liberation War [283]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nWhile portrayals of Indira Gandhi by actors in Indian cinema have generally been avoided, with filmmakers using back-shots, silhouettes and voiceovers to give impressions of her character, several films surrounding her tenure, policies or assassination have been made [292]\n\n\nPosthumous honours\nBook written by Indira Gandhi\n\n\nBibliography\nBook written by Indira Gandhi\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indira Gandhi\n\nIntroduction\nIndira Gandhi was a prominent Indian politician who served as the Prime Minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. She was the first and, to date, the only woman to hold the office of Prime Minister of India. Gandhi was a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family, which has produced three of India's Prime Ministers, including her father Jawaharlal Nehru and her son Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nEarly life and career\nIndira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru on November 19, 1917, in Allahabad, India, into a Kashmiri Pandit family. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a leading figure in the Indian movement for independence from British rule and became the first Prime Minister of the Dominion (and later Republic) of India. Gandhi was her parents' only surviving child (she had a younger brother who died while young); she grew up with her mother, Kamala Nehru, at the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad. In 1930, the Nehru family donated the mansion to the Indian National Congress and renamed it Swaraj Bhavan (meaning abode of freedom). A new mansion was built nearby to serve as the family residence and given the name of the old Anand Bhavan. Gandhi had a lonely and unhappy childhood. Her father was often away, directing political activities or incarcerated, while her mother was frequently bedridden with illness and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis. Gandhi had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.\n\nFirst, second and third term as prime minister between 1966 and 1977\nGandhi's first eleven years serving as prime minister saw her evolve from the perception of Congress party leaders as their puppet, to a strong leader with the iron resolve to split the party over her policy positions, or to go to war with Pakistan to assist Bangladesh in the 1971 liberation war. At the end of 1977, she was such a dominating figure in Indian politics that Congress party president D K Barooah had coined the phrase \"India is Indira and Indira is India.\"\n\nFirst year\nGandhi formed her government with Morarji Desai as deputy prime minister and finance minister. At the beginning of her first term as prime minister, she was widely criticized by the media and the opposition as a \"Goongi goodiya\" (Hindi for a \"dumb doll\") of the Congress party bosses who had orchestrated her election and then tried to constrain her. Indira was a reluctant successor to her famed father, although she had accompanied him on several official foreign visits and played an anchor role in bringing down the first democratically elected communist government in Kerala. According to certain sources, it was the socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia that first derided her personality as the \"Goongi Goodiya\" (Hindi for \"dumb doll\") that later was echoed by other Congress politicians who were wary of her rise in the party.\n\n1967–1971\nThe first electoral test for Gandhi was the 1967 general elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha after these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis. Gandhi was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Raebareli constituency. She had a rocky start after agreeing to devalue the rupee which created hardship for Indian businesses and consumers. The importation of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.\n\nMilitary conflict with China\nIn 1967, a military conflict alongside the border of the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim, then an Indian protectorate, broke out between India and China. India won by repelling Chinese attacks and forced the subsequent withdrawal of Chinese forces from the region. Throughout the conflict, the Indian losses were 88 killed and 163 wounded while Chinese casualties stood at 340 killed and 450 wounded, according to the Indian Defense Ministry. Chinese sources made no declarations of casualties but alleged India to be the aggressor.\n\n1971–1977\nGaribi Hatao (Remove Poverty) was the resonant theme for Gandhi's 1971 political bid. The slogan was developed in response to the combined opposition alliance's use of the two-word manifesto—\"Indira Hatao\" (Remove Indira). The Garibi Hatao slogan and the proposed anti-poverty programs that came with it were designed to give Gandhi independent national support, based on the rural and urban poor. This would allow her to bypass the dominant rural castes both in and of state and local governments as well as the urban commercial class. For their part, the previously voiceless poor would at last gain both political worth and political weight. The programs created through Garibi Hatao, though carried out locally, were funded and developed by the Central Government in New Delhi. The program was supervised and staffed by the Indian National Congress party \"These programs also provided the central political leadership with new and vast patronage resources to be disbursed throughout the country.\"\n\nWar with Pakistan\nGandhi's biggest achievement following the 1977 elections came in December 1971 with India's decisive victory over Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War. That victory occurred in the last two weeks of the Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to the formation of independent Bangladesh. An insurgency in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) formed in early 1971, with Bengali's and East Pakistanis revolting against authoritarian rule from the central West Pakistan Government. In response, Pakistani security forces launched the infamous Operation Searchlight, in which Pakistan committed genocide among Bengali Hindus, nationalists and intelligentsia. Gandhi's India was initially restrained from intervening in the insurgency but quickly started to support Bengali rebels through the provision of military supplies. Indian forces clashed multiple times with Pakistani forces in the Eastern border. At one point, Indian forces along with Mukti Bahini rebels allied together and attacked Pakistani forces at Dhalai. The attack, supported and later successfully executed by India, was done to stop Pakistani cross-border shelling. The battle occurred more than a month before India's official intervention in December. Gandhi quickly dispatched more troops to the Eastern border with East Pakistan, hoping to support Mukti Bahini rebels and cease any Pakistani infiltration. Indian forces then clashed again with Pakistani forces after Indian forces crossed the border and secured Garibpur after a one-day battle lasting from 20 November 1971 to the 21st. The next day, on 22 November, Indian and Pakistani aircraft engaged in a dogfight over the Boyra Salient, in which thousands of people watched as 4 Indian Folland Gnats shot down 2 Pakistani Canadair Sabres and damaged another. Both Pakistani pilots that were shot down were captured as prisoners of war. The Battle of Boyra instantly made the 4 Indian pilots celebrities and created large-scale nationalism as the Bangladesh Liberation War saw more and more Indian intervention and escalation. Other clashes also happened on the same day but did not receive as much media attention as did the battle of Boyra and Garibpur. On 3 December 1971, the Pakistan Air Force launched Operation Chengiz Khan, which saw Pakistani aircraft attacking Indian airbases and military installations across the Western border in a pre-emptive strike. The initial night-time attack by Pakistani forces was foiled, failing to inflict any major damage on Indian airbases, allowing Indian aircraft to counterattack into West Pakistan. Gandhi quickly declared a state of emergency and addressed the nation on radio shortly after midnight, stating: \"We must be prepared for a long period of hardship and sacrifice.\"\n\nVerdict on electoral malpractice\nOn 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court declared Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on the grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by her 1971 opponent, Raj Narain (who later defeated her in the 1977 parliamentary election running in the Raebareli constituency), alleged several major as well as minor instances of the use of government resources for campaigning. Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Ashoke Kumar Sen, to defend her in court. She gave evidence in her defence during the trial. After almost four years, the court found her guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes. The judge, however, rejected the more serious charges of bribery, laid against her in the case.\n\nState of Emergency (1975–1977)\nGandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government recommended that then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a state of emergency because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975. At the time of emergency, there was a widespread rumour that Gandhi had ordered her search guards to eliminate firebrand trade unionist and socialist party leader George Fernandes, while he was on a run. Few International organisations and Government officials issued request letters to Indira Gandhi pleading her to relinquish such decrees. Fernandes had called a nationwide railway strike in 1974, that shut the railways for three weeks and became the largest industrial action in Asia Gandhi had turned furious over him and the strike was massively cracked down.\n\nRule by decree\nWithin a few months, President's rule was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party. Police were granted powers to impose curfews and detain citizens indefinitely; all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were postponed indefinitely, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on the recommendation of the state's governor.\n\nRise of Sanjay Gandhi\nDuring the emergency, Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, entered into Indian politics. He wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any government office. According to Mark Tully, \"His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state.\" It was said that during the emergency Sanjay virtually ran India along with his friends, especially Bansi Lal. It was also quipped that Sanjay had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office).\n\n1977 election and opposition years\nIn 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Indira Gandhi called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. She may have grossly misjudged her popularity by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her. She was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. The alliance was made up of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and Charan Singh's Bharatiya Kranti Dal representing northern peasants and farmers. The Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977; veteran Gandhi supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD (Congress for Democracy) due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.\n\nIn opposition and return to power\nSince Indira Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed Yashwantrao Chavan as their parliamentary party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira. She won a by-election in the Chikmagalur constituency and took a seat in the Lok Sabha in November 1978 [after the Janata Party's attempts to have Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar run against her failed when he refused to contest the election saying he wanted to remain apolitical]. However, the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh, ordered her arrest along with Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament. The allegations included that she \"had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency\" However, the strategy backfired disastrously. In response to her arrest, Gandhi's supporters hijacked an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her) The party included right-wing Hindu nationalists, socialists, and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government began to unravel over the issue of the dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)—the Hindu nationalist, paramilitary organisation. The ambitious Union finance minister, Charan Singh, who as the Union home minister during the previous year had ordered Gandhi's arrests, took advantage of this and started courting Indira and Sanjay. After a significant exodus from the party to Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979 Singh was appointed prime minister by President Reddy, after Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress(I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions. The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay. Since Singh refused to drop them, Congress(I) withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979.\n\n1980 elections and fourth term\nThe Congress Party under Gandhi swept back into power in January 1980 [In this election, Gandhi was elected by the voters of the Medak constituency]. On 23 June, Sanjay Gandhi was killed in a plane crash while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre in New Delhi [In 1980, as a tribute to her son's dream of launching an indigenously manufactured car, Indira Gandhi nationalized Sanjay's debt-ridden company, Maruti Udyog, for Rs 43,000,000 (4.34 crore) and invited joint venture bids from automobile companies around the world Suzuki of Japan was selected as the partner. The company launched its first Indian-manufactured car in 1984].\n\nOperation Blue Star\nAfter the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the Sikh-majority Akali Dal came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab In an effort to split the Akali Dal and gain popular support among the Sikhs, Gandhi's Congress Party helped to bring the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to prominence in Punjab politics [Later, Bhindranwale's organisation, Damdami Taksal, became embroiled in violence with another religious sect called the Sant Nirankari Mission and he was accused of instigating the murder of Jagat Narain, the owner of the Punjab Kesari newspaper]. After being arrested, Bhindranwale disassociated himself from the Congress Party and joined Akali Dal [In July 1982, he led the campaign for the implementation of the Anandpur Resolution, which demanded greater autonomy for the Sikh-majority state]. Meanwhile, a small group of Sikhs, including some of Bhindranwale's followers, turned to militancy after being targeted by government officials and police for supporting the Anandpur Resolution [In 1982, Bhindranwale and approximately 200 armed followers moved into a guest house called the Guru Nanak Niwas near the Golden Temple]. Gandhi's government decided to forcibly remove Bhindranwale and his followers from the Golden Temple, and in June 1984, she ordered the military to storm the temple complex [The storming, known as Operation Blue Star, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians and led to increased militancy among the Sikh community].\n\nAssassination\n\"I am alive today, I may not be there tomorrow… I shall continue to serve until my last breath and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it… Even if I died in the service of the nation, I would be proud of it Every drop of my blood… will contribute to the growth of this nation and to make it strong and dynamic.\"\n\nInternational reaction\nGandhi's death was mourned worldwide World leaders condemned the assassination and said her death would leave a 'big emptiness' in international affairs In Moscow, Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko sent condolences, \"The Soviet people learned with pain and sorrow about the untimely death in a villainous assassination of the glorious daughter of the great Indian people, a fiery fighter for peace and security of peoples and a great friend of the Soviet Union\" President Ronald Reagan, along with Secretary of State George Shultz, visited the Indian Embassy to sign a book of condolences and expressed his 'shock, revulsion, and grief' over the assassination 42nd vice president of the United States Walter Mondale called Gandhi 'a great leader of a great democracy' and deplored 'this shocking act of violence' Asian, African, and European leaders mourned Gandhi as a great champion of democracy and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its 'deepest grief' and called the killing a 'terrorist' act South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan said Gandhi's death meant the 'loss of a great leader to the whole world.' Yugoslav President Veselin Đuranović, Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, Italian President Sandro Pertini, Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, and French President François Mitterrand condemned the killing At the United Nations, the General Assembly paused during its work as shocked delegates mourned the death Assembly President Paul Lusaka of Zambia postponed a scheduled debate and hastily organised a memorial meeting [139].\n\nForeign relations\nGandhi is remembered for her ability to effectively promote Indian foreign policy measures [140] [141] [142]\n\nSouth Asia\nIn early 1971, disputed elections in Pakistan led then East Pakistan to declare independence as Bangladesh Repression and violence by the Pakistani army led to 10 million refugees crossing the border into India over the following months [143] Finally, in December 1971, Gandhi intervened directly in the conflict to liberate Bangladesh India emerged victorious following the war with Pakistan to become the dominant power of South Asia [144] India had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union promising mutual assistance in the case of war, [143] while Pakistan received active support from the United States during the conflict [145] U.S President Richard Nixon disliked Gandhi personally, referring to", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indira_Gandhi\" following this

Opposition parties The alliance was made up of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and Charan Singh's Bharatiya Kranti Dal representing northern peasants and farmers The Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977; veteran Gandhi supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, and Nandini Satpathy were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD (Congress for Democracy) due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that The Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted The alliance parties later merged to form the Janata Party under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan The other leaders of the Janata Party were Charan Singh, Raj Narain, George Fernandes, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee [89]\n\n\nIn opposition and return to power\nSince Indira Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed Yashwantrao Chavan as their parliamentary party leader Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira She won a by-election in the Chikmagalur Constituency and took a seat in the Lok Sabha in November 1978 [91] [92] after the Janata Party's attempts to have Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar run against her failed when he refused to contest the election saying he wanted to remain apolitical [93] However, the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh, ordered her arrest along with Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court The arrest meant that Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament The allegations included that she \"had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency\" [94] However, the strategy backfired disastrously In response to her arrest, Gandhi's supporters hijacked an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release [95] Her arrest and long-running trial gained her sympathy from many people The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her) The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists, and former Congress party members With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting In 1979, the government began to unravel over the issue of the dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)—the Hindu nationalist, [96] [97] paramilitary [98] organisation The ambitious Union finance minister, Charan Singh, who as the Union home minister during the previous year had ordered the Gandhi's' arrests, took advantage of this and started courting Indira and Sanjay After a significant exodus from the party to Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979 Singh was appointed prime minister, by President Reddy, after Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress (I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions [99] [100] The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay Since Singh refused to drop them, Congress (I) withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979 [101]\n\n\n1980 elections and fourth term\nThe Congress Party under Gandhi swept back into power in January 1980 [104] In this election, Gandhi was elected by the voters of the Medak constituency [105] On 23 June, Sanjay Gandhi was killed in a plane crash while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre in New Delhi [106] In 1980, as a tribute to her son's dream of launching an indigenously manufactured car, Indira Gandhi nationalized Sanjay's debt-ridden company, Maruti Udyog, for Rs 43,000,000 (4.34 crore) and invited joint venture bids from automobile companies around the world Suzuki of Japan was selected as the partner The company launched its first Indian-manufactured car in 1984 [107]\n\n\nOperation Blue Star\nAfter the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the Sikh-majority Akali Dal came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab In an effort to split the Akali Dal and gain popular support among the Sikhs, Gandhi's Congress Party helped to bring the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to prominence in Punjab politics [111] [112] Later, Bhindranwale's organisation, Damdami Taksal, became embroiled in violence with another religious sect called the Sant Nirankari Mission and he was accused of instigating the murder of Jagat Narain, the owner of the Punjab Kesari newspaper [113] After being arrested, Bhindranwale disassociated himself from the Congress Party and joined Akali Dal [114] In July 1982, he led the campaign for the implementation of the Anandpur Resolution, which demanded greater autonomy for the Sikh-majority state Meanwhile, a small group of Sikhs, including some of Bhindranwale's followers, turned to militancy after being targeted by government officials and police for supporting the Anandpur Resolution [115] In 1982, Bhindranwale and approximately 200 armed followers moved into a guest house called the Guru Nanak Niwas near the Golden Temple [116]\n\n\nAssassination\n\"I am alive today, I may not be there tomorrow .. I shall continue to serve until my last breath and when I die, I can say, that every drop of my blood will invigorate India and strengthen it  .. Even if I died in the service of the nation, I would be proud of it Every drop of my blood .. will contribute to the growth of this nation and to make it strong and dynamic.\"\n\n\nInternational reaction\nGandhi's death was mourned worldwide World leaders condemned the assassination and said her death would leave a 'big emptiness' in international affairs In Moscow, Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko sent condolences, \"The Soviet people learned with pain and sorrow about the untimely death in a villainous assassination of the glorious daughter of the great Indian people, a fiery fighter for peace and security of peoples and a great friend of the Soviet Union\" President Ronald Reagan, along with Secretary of State George Shultz, visited the Indian Embassy to sign a book of condolences and expressed his 'shock, revulsion, and grief' over the assassination 42nd vice president of the United States Walter Mondale called Gandhi 'a great leader of a great democracy' and deplored 'this shocking act of violence' Asian, African, and European leaders mourned Gandhi as a great champion of democracy and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement expressed its 'deepest grief' and called the killing a 'terrorist' act South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, said Gandhi's death meant the 'loss of a great leader to the whole world.' Yugoslav President Veselin Đuranović, Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, Italian President Sandro Pertini, Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, and French President François Mitterrand condemned the killing At the United Nations, the General Assembly paused during its work as shocked delegates mourned the death Assembly President Paul Lusaka of Zambia postponed a scheduled debate and hastily organized a memorial meeting [139]\n\n\nForeign relations\nGandhi is remembered for her ability to effectively promote Indian foreign policy measures [140] [141] [142]\n\n\nSouth Asia\nIn early 1971, disputed elections in Pakistan led then East Pakistan to declare independence as Bangladesh Repression and violence by the Pakistani army led to 10 million refugees crossing the border into India over the following months [143] Finally, in December 1971, Gandhi intervened directly in the conflict to liberate Bangladesh India emerged victorious following the war with Pakistan to become the dominant power of South Asia [144] India had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union promising mutual assistance in the case of war, [143] while Pakistan received active support from the United States during the conflict [145] U.S President Richard Nixon disliked Gandhi personally, referring to her as a \"bitch\" [146] and a \"clever fox\" in his private communication with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [147] Nixon later wrote of the war: \" [Gandhi] suckered  [America] Suckered us .. this woman suckered us.\" [148] Relations with the U.S became distant as Gandhi developed closer ties with the Soviet Union after the war The latter grew to become India's largest trading partner and its biggest arms supplier for much of Gandhi's premiership [149] India's new hegemonic position, as articulated under the \"Indira Doctrine\", led to attempts to bring the Himalayan states under India's sphere of influence [150] Nepal and Bhutan remained aligned with India, while in 1975, after years of campaigning, Sikkim voted to join India in a referendum [59] [151]\n\n\nMiddle East\nGandhi remained a staunch supporter of the Palestinians in the Arab–Israeli conflict and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States [158] Israel was viewed as a religious state, and thus an analogue to India's archrival Pakistan Indian diplomats hoped to win Arab support in countering Pakistan in Kashmir Nevertheless, Gandhi authorised the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s Her lieutenant, P V Narasimha Rao, later became prime minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992 [165]\n\n\nAsia-Pacific\nOne of the major developments in Southeast Asia during Gandhi's premiership was the formation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967 Relations between ASEAN and India were mutually antagonistic India perceived ASEAN to be linked to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and, therefore, it was seen as a pro-American organisation On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the Viet Cong and India's strong links with the USSR Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971 India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 also contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia [170] Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the ZOPFAN declaration and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region Nevertheless, Gandhi's close relations with reunified Vietnam and her decision to recognize the Vietnam-installed Government of Cambodia in 1980 meant that India and ASEAN were unable to develop a viable partnership [170]\n\n\nAfrica\nAlthough independent India was initially viewed as a champion of various African independence movements, its cordial relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations and its liberal views of British policies in East Africa had harmed its image as a staunch supporter of various independence movements in the third world [172] Indian condemnation of militant struggles in Kenya and Algeria was in sharp contrast to China, who had supported armed struggle to win African independence [172] After reaching a high diplomatic point in the aftermath of Nehru's role in the Suez Crisis, India's isolation from Africa was almost complete when only four nations—Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Libya—supported her during the Sino-Indian War in 1962 [172] After Gandhi became prime minister, diplomatic and economic relations with the states which had sided with India during the Sino-Indian War were expanded [172] Gandhi began negotiations with the Kenyan government to establish the Africa-India Development Cooperation The Indian government also started considering the possibility of bringing Indians settled in Africa within the framework of its policy goals to help recover its declining geo-strategic influence Gandhi declared the people of Indian origin settled in Africa as \"Ambassadors of India\" [172] Efforts to rope in the Asian community to join Indian diplomacy, however, came to naught, in part because of the unwillingness of Indians to remain in politically insecure surroundings, and because of the exodus of African Indians to Britain with the passing of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1968 [172] In Uganda, the African Indian community suffered persecution and eventually expulsion under the government of Idi Amin [173]\n\n\nThe Commonwealth\nThe Commonwealth is a voluntary association of mainly former British colonies India maintained cordial relations with most of the members during Gandhi's time in power In the 1980s, she along with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, Zambia's president Kenneth Kaunda, Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew was regarded as being one of the pillars of the Commonwealth [175] India under Gandhi also hosted the 1983 Commonwealth Heads of Government summit in New Delhi Gandhi used the meetings as a forum to put pressure on member countries to cut economic, sports, and cultural ties with apartheid South Africa [176]\n\n\nThe Non-aligned Movement\nIn the early 1980s under Gandhi, India attempted to reassert its prominent role in the Non-Aligned Movement by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development By appealing to the economic grievances of developing countries, Gandhi and her successors exercised a moderating influence on the Non-aligned movement, diverting it from some of the Cold War issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting where Cuban leader Fidel Castro attempted to steer the movement towards the Soviet Union [177] Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the movement, its close relations with the Soviet Union and its pro-Soviet positions on Afghanistan and Cambodia limited its influence [178]\n\n\nWestern Europe\nGandhi spent a number of years in Europe during her youth and had formed many friendships there During her premiership she formed friendships with many leaders including West German chancellor, Willy Brandt [179] and Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky [180] She enjoyed a close working relationship with many British leaders including conservative premiers, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher [181]\n\n\nSoviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries\nThe relationship between India and the Soviet Union deepened during Gandhi's rule The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and China, rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner [182]\n\n\nSoviet intelligence in India\nSoviet intelligence was involved in India during Indira Gandhi's administration, sometimes at Gandhi's expense In the prelude to Operation Blue Star, by 1981, the Soviets had launched Operation Kontakt, which was based on a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by the ISI to Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country [183] In November 1982, Yuri Andropov, the General Secretary of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet Union, approved a proposal to fabricate Pakistani intelligence documents detailing ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state [184] Indira Gandhi's decision to move troops into the Punjab was based on her taking seriously the information provided by the Soviets regarding secret CIA support for the Sikhs [185]\n\n\nUnited States\nWhen Gandhi came to power in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US president At the time, India was reliant on the US for food aid Gandhi resented the US policy of food aid being used as a tool to force India to adopt policies favoured by the US She also resolutely refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Relations with the US were strained badly under President Richard Nixon and his favouring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war Nixon despised Gandhi politically and personally [195] In 1981, Gandhi met President Ronald Reagan for the first time at the North–South Summit held to discuss global poverty She had been described to him as an 'Ogre', but he found her charming and easy to work with and they formed a close working relationship during her premiership in the 1980s [196]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nGandhi presided over three Five-Year Plans as prime minister, two of which succeeded in meeting their targeted growth [197]\n\n\nGreen Revolution and the Fourth Five-Year Plan\nGandhi inherited a weak and troubled economy Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence [49] [53] The government responded by taking steps to liberalise the economy and agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid [49] The economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966–1969 [200] [208] Much of that growth however, was offset by the fact that the external aid promised by the United States government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), meant to ease the short-run costs of adjustment to a liberalised economy, never materialised [49] American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on the economy At the same time, Indo-US relations were strained because of Gandhi's criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam While it was thought at the time, and for decades after, that President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to coerce Indian support for the war, in fact, it was to offer India rainmaking technology that he wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb [209] [210] In light of the circumstances, liberalisation became politically suspect and was soon abandoned [49] Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India After the bitter experience with Johnson, Gandhi decided not to request food aid in the future Moreover, her government resolved never again to become \"so vulnerably dependent\" on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves [211] When food stocks slumped after poor harvests in 1972, the government made it a point to use foreign exchange to buy US wheat commercially rather than seek resumption of food aid [212]\n\n\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan\nThe Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974–1979) was enacted with the backdrop of the state of emergency and the Twenty Point Program of 1975 [200] It was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act which has often been justified on economic grounds [200] In contrast to the reception of Gandhi's earlier economic plan, this one was criticised for being a \"hastily thrown together wish list.\" [200] She promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide-ranging social and economic reforms In addition, the government targeted an annual growth rate of 4.4% over the period of the plan [197]\n\n\nOperation Forward and the Sixth Five-Year Plan\nGandhi inherited a weak economy when she became prime minister again in 1980 [216] The preceding year—1979–80—under the Janata Party government saw the strongest recession (−5.2%) in the history of modern India with inflation rampant at 18.2% [53] [215] [217] Gandhi proceeded to abrogate the Janata Party government's Five-Year Plan in 1980 and launched the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980–85) Her government targeted an average growth rate of 5.2% over the period of the plan [197] Measures to check inflation were also taken; by the early 1980s it was under control at an annual rate of about 5% [217]\n\n\nInflation and unemployment\nDuring Lal Bahadur Shastri's last full year in office (1965), inflation averaged 7.7%, compared to 5.2% at the end of Gandhi's first term in office (1977) [220] On average, inflation in India had remained below 7% through the 1950s and 1960s [221] It then accelerated sharply in the 1970s, from 5.5% in 1970–71 to over 20% by 1973–74, due to the international oil crisis [220] Gandhi declared inflation the gravest of problems in 1974 (at 25.2%) and devised a severe anti-inflation program The government was successful in bringing down inflation during the emergency; achieving negative figures of −1.1% by the end of 1975–76 [216] [220]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nDespite the provisions, control and regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India had continued to be owned and operated by private persons [223] Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies and ignoring priority sector lending Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority of the population) unbanked [224] After becoming prime minister, Gandhi expressed her intention of nationalising the banks to alleviate poverty in a paper titled, \"Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation\" [225] The paper received overwhelming public support [225] In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks After this, public sector bank branch deposits increased by approximately 800 percent; advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent [226] Nationalisation also resulted in significant growth in the geographic coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in unbanked, rural areas The nationalisation drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small- and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base [227] Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, solidly praised her nationalisation of banks [224]\n\n\nNationalisation\nDespite the provisions, control and regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India had continued to be owned and operated by private persons [223] Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies and ignoring priority sector lending Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority of the

[227] Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, solidly praised her nationalisation of banks [224]\n\n\nAdministration\nIn 1966, Gandhi accepted the demands of the Akalis to reorganise Punjab on linguistic lines The Hindi-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, Haryana, while the Pahari speaking hilly areas in the northeast were joined to Himachal Pradesh [231] By this action she had hoped to ward off the growing political conflict between Hindu and Sikh groups in the region [231] However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akalis was the status of Chandigarh, a prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border, which Gandhi declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states [232]\n\n\nSocial reform\nThe principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women was enshrined in the Indian Constitution under the Gandhi administration [235]\n\n\nLanguage policy\nUnder the 1950 Constitution of India, Hindi was to be the official national language by 1965 That was unacceptable to many non-Hindi-speaking states which wanted the continued use of English in government In 1967, Gandhi introduced a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages It established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi-speaking Indian states [205] She thus put herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision [237] Nevertheless, critics alleged that her stance was actually meant to weaken the position of rival Congress leaders from the northern states such as Uttar Pradesh, where there had been strong, sometimes violent, pro-Hindi agitations [205] Gandhi came out of the language conflicts with the strong support of the south Indian populace [237]\n\n\nNational security\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, Gandhi had the Indian army crush militant Communist uprisings in the Indian state of West Bengal [238] The communist insurgency in India was completely suppressed during the state of emergency [239] [240] [241]\n\n\nIndia's nuclear programme\nGandhi contributed to and carried out further, the vision of Jawaharlal Nehru, the former premier of India, to develop its nuclear program [248] [249] Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to Test No 6 by the People's Republic of China Gandhi saw the test as Chinese nuclear intimidation and promoted Nehru's views to establish India's stability and security interests independent from those of the nuclear superpowers [250]\n\n\nPersonal life\nShe married Feroze Gandhi at the age of 25, in 1942 Their marriage lasted 18 years until he died of a heart attack in 1960 [254] [255] They had two sons—Rajiv and Sanjay Initially, her younger son Sanjay had been her chosen heir, but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Indira Gandhi persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981 Rajiv took office as prime minister following his mother's assassination in 1984; he served until December 1989 Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber working on behalf of LTTE on 21 May 1991 [256]\n\n\nViews on women\nIn 1952 in a letter to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: \"I am in no sense a feminist, but I believe in women being able to do everything.. Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.\" While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi's complex feelings toward her gender and feminism [257] Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality \"Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said she hardly knew the difference between a boy and a girl until the age of twelve.\" [258] [259]\n\n\nState honours\nAmerican veteran politician Henry A Kissinger had described Indira Gandhi as being an \"Iron lady\", [277] [278] [279] a nickname that became associated with her tough personality [278] [279] [277] After leading India to victory against Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, President V V Giri awarded Gandhi with India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna [280] [281] [282] In 2011, the Bangladesh Freedom Honour, Bangladesh's highest civilian award for foreign nationals, was posthumously conferred on Gandhi for her \"outstanding contributions\" to Bangladesh's Liberation War [283]\n\n\nLegacy\nAmerican veteran politician Henry A Kissinger had described Indira Gandhi as being an \"Iron lady\", [277] [278] [279] a nickname that became associated with her tough personality [278] [279] [277] After leading India to victory against Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, President V V Giri awarded Gandhi with India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna [280] [281] [282] In 2011, the Bangladesh Freedom Honour, Bangladesh's highest civilian award for foreign nationals, was posthumously conferred on Gandhi for her \"outstanding contributions\" to Bangladesh's Liberation War [283]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nWhile portrayals of Indira Gandhi by actors in Indian cinema have generally been avoided, with filmmakers using back-shots, silhouettes and voiceovers to give impressions of her character, several films surrounding her tenure, policies or assassination have been made [292]\n\n\nPosthumous honours\nBook written by Indira Gandhi\n\n\nBibliography\nBook written by Indira Gandhi\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the charges were attributable to purchases made at Kardashian's family-owned boutique in 2006 and 2007, after Kardashian was no longer employed by Norwood's daughter Norwood further alleged that, at the request of her children, she did not file criminal charges, instead presenting her allegations personally to Kardashian, and that Kardashian apologized and promised to repay the debt In 2008, no

Legend**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI Am Legend is a 2007 American post-apocalyptic science fiction horror film directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith. The film is an adaptation of the 1954 novel of the same name by Richard Matheson. The story follows Robert Neville, a scientist who is the last human survivor of a worldwide pandemic that turns people into vampiric, albino, cannibalistic mutants called Darkseekers.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a post-apocalyptic New York City, where a genetically re-engineered measles virus has been released to cure cancer, but has instead turned people into Darkseekers. The Darkseekers are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and roam at night, preying on the naturally immune survivors. Robert Neville, played by Will Smith, is a scientist who is immune to the virus and is the last human survivor of the outbreak. He is left to fend for himself, with no one to talk to or rely on.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Neville tries to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus and find a cure for the Darkseekers. He also struggles with the emotional toll of being alone and the guilt of being the last human survivor. The film takes a darker tone as Neville's isolation and loneliness begin to take a toll on his mental health.\n\n**Theatrical Ending**\n\nThe film's theatrical ending features Neville discovering the last treatment was successful, but the Darkseekers attack the lab, killing both Neville and the attacking Darkseekers. However, this ending was not well-received by fans and critics, who felt it was too abrupt and did not provide closure for the characters.\n\n**Alternate Ending**\n\nThe alternate ending, which was included in the special edition DVD release, features a more hopeful tone, where Neville puts down his gun and confronts the alpha male Darkseeker. The alpha male and his followers are revealed to be trying to recover their mate, and Neville is shown to be remorseful for his actions. The ending is more in line with the novel, where Neville comes to terms with his actions and finds a sense of peace.\n\n**Cast**\n\nWill Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006, citing the film's potential for emotional depth and complexity. He stated that the film was like \"Gladiator\" or \"Forrest Gump\" in terms of its audience-pleasing elements and artistic value. Smith also compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health, and cited Tom Hanks' performance in \"Cast Away\" as an influence.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35. The film's director, Francis Lawrence, wanted to take advantage of the location shooting in New York City to create a natural feel. The film was also shot on location in various parts of the city, including the Grand Central Terminal viaduct and Washington Square Park.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe soundtrack for \"I Am Legend\" was released on January 15, 2008, under the record label Varèse Sarabande. The music was composed by James Newton Howard, and features the songs of Bob Marley, including \"Redemption Song\" and \"Three Little Birds\". Marley is also discussed in the film, and Neville's daughter is named after him.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally slated for a November 21, 2007, release in the United States and Canada, but was delayed to December 14. The film opened on December 26, 2007, in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The film's teaser trailer was attached to the screenings of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\".\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign included a tie-in comic from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics, titled \"I Am Legend: Awakening\". The comic was created by Bill Sienkiewicz, screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and author Orson Scott Card. The project also included animated featurettes on the official website, created by the team from \"Broken Saints\".\n\n**Home Media**\n\nThe film was released on DVD on March 18, 2008, in two editions: a one-disc release and a two-disc special edition.

The film was also released on Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD formats.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film collected $77.2 million during its opening weekend, ranking in first place at the box office above \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\". The film surpassed \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" to have the highest December opening weekend. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was praised for Will Smith's performance.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 217 reviews, with an average rating of 6.34/10.

Will Smith won a Saturn Award for Best Actor and an MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nThe film's director, Francis Lawrence, stated in 2008 that there would be a prequel, with Will Smith reprising his role. The plot would reveal what happened to Neville before the infected took over New York. However, the prequel was later canceled, and Lawrence stated that he did not think it would ever happen.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"I_Am_Legend_(film)\"

He made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, particularly in number theory, analysis, and algebra. Ramanujan's work is considered some of the most important in the history of mathematics, and his legacy continues to inspire mathematicians and scientists today.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRamanujan was born into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, Tamil Nadu. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, was a clerk in a sari shop, and his mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife who sang at a local temple. Ramanujan's family lived in a small traditional home in Kumbakonam, where he spent most of his childhood. Tragedy struck early in Ramanujan's life when his younger brother, Sadagopan, died at just three months old. In 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, but recovered, unlike many others in the area who died from the disease.\n\n**Adulthood in India**\n\nAs a young man, Ramanujan was deeply interested in mathematics and began to develop his skills in the subject. In 1909, he married Janaki, a girl from a nearby village, who was just ten years old at the time. The marriage was arranged by Ramanujan's mother, who had chosen Janaki for her son. Janaki continued to live with her maternal family for three years after the marriage, until she reached puberty. In 1912, Janaki joined Ramanujan in Madras, where he had moved to pursue his mathematical interests.\n\n**Pursuit of Career in Mathematics**\n\nIn 1910, Ramanujan met V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, a deputy collector who was also a mathematician. Aiyer was impressed by Ramanujan's mathematical abilities and encouraged him to pursue his interests. Ramanujan showed Aiyer his mathematics notebooks, which contained many original results and insights. Aiyer introduced Ramanujan to the Indian Mathematical Society, which helped to further develop his skills and knowledge.\n\n**Contacting British Mathematicians**\n\nIn the spring of 1913, Ramanujan's friends, Narayana Iyer and Ramachandra Rao, attempted to present his work to British mathematicians. They drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University, including G.H. Hardy and J.E. Littlewood. Hardy was impressed by Ramanujan's work and saw great potential in him.\n\n**Life in England**\n\nIn 1914, Ramanujan traveled to England to pursue his mathematical interests further. He was greeted by Hardy, who was instrumental in securing Ramanujan a position at Cambridge University. Ramanujan immediately began working with Hardy and Littlewood, and his mathematical output increased significantly. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918, at the age of 31.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nRamanujan's health began to decline in 1917, and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was confined to a sanatorium in England, where he continued to work on mathematics. In 1919, Ramanujan returned to India, where he died in 1920, at the age of 32.\n\n**Personality and Spiritual Life**\n\nRamanujan was a deeply spiritual person who believed in the power of mathematics to reveal the underlying order of the universe. He often said that his mathematical insights came to him through visions and dreams. In a famous letter to Hardy, Ramanujan described how he would often see mathematical formulas appearing before him like a vision.\n\n**Mathematical Achievements**\n\nRamanujan's mathematical contributions are numerous and significant. He made important discoveries in number theory, algebra, and analysis, including the famous Ramanujan summation formula and the Ramanujan prime. His work on the distribution of prime numbers is also considered some of the most important in the field.\n\n**The Ramanujan Conjecture**\n\nOne of Ramanujan's most famous conjectures is the Ramanujan conjecture, which states that the tau-function, a generating function for the Ramanujan prime, is a cusp form. This conjecture was finally proven in 1973 by Pierre Deligne, who was awarded the Fields Medal for his work.\n\n**Ramanujan's Notebooks**\n\nRamanujan's notebooks contain many of his original results and insights, which were developed over several years. The notebooks were mostly written without derivations, which led to the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results. However, mathematician Bruce C. Berndt has shown that Ramanujan was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to record the proofs in his notebooks.\n\n**Hardy-Ramanujan Number**\n\nThe number 1729 is known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number, which was discovered by Ramanujan and Hardy. The number is notable for being the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\n\n**Mathematicians' Views of Ramanujan**\n\nRamanujan's work has inspired many mathematicians, including Hardy, Littlewood, and Bertrand Russell. Hardy said that Ramanujan's work was \"one of the most remarkable examples of the power of the human mind\" and that his contributions were \"so great that they would have been enough to guarantee his place in the history of mathematics even if he had done nothing else.\"\n\n**Posthumous Recognition**\n\nRamanujan's contributions to mathematics were recognized posthumously when he was listed among other distinguished scientists and mathematicians on a \"Calendar of Scientific Pioneers\" in the journal Nature. His home state of Tamil Nadu celebrates 22 December, Ramanujan's birthday, as \"State IT Day.\"\n\n**Commemorative Postal Stamps**\n\nIndia Post has released several commemorative stamps featuring Ramanujan, including ones in 1962, 2011, 2012, and 2016.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nRamanujan's life and work have been the subject of several books, films, and documentaries. The 2014 film \"The Man Who Knew Infinity\" is based on the book of the same name by Robert Kanigel and stars Dev Patel as Ramanujan.\n\n**Selected Papers**\n\nRamanujan's papers are numerous and include:\n\n* \"Modular equations and approximations to π\"\n* \"Some properties of p-adic numbers\"\n* \"On certain arithmetical functions\"\n\n**Further Works of Ramanujan's Mathematics**\n\nSome of Ramanujan's other notable works include:\n\n* \"The Ramanujan summation formula\"\n* \"The Ramanujan prime\"\n* \"The Ramanujan tau-function\"\n\n**Selected Publications on Ramanujan and His Work**\n\nSome notable publications on Ramanujan and his work include:\n\n* \"The Man Who Knew Infinity\" by Robert Kanigel\n* \"Ramanujan: Letters and Reminiscences\" edited by E.R. Dawson\n* \"Ramanujan: Essays and Surveys\" edited by G.H. Hardy and B.M.

in the year following the attacks the Ground Zero site became the most visited place in the United States On September 10, 2002, the Viewing Wall, a temporary display containing information about the attacks and listing the names of the dead, opened to the public [43]\n\n\nConstruction\nThe symbolic cornerstone of One World Trade Center was laid in a ceremony on July 4, 2004 [49] The stone had an inscription supposedly written by Arthur J Finkelstein [50] Construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money, security, and design [49] The last major issues were resolved on April 26, 2006, when a deal was made between developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on June 23, 2006 [51] Soon after, explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the building's foundation, onto which 400 cubic yards (310 cubic meters) of concrete was poured by November 2007 [52] In a December 18, 2006, ceremony held in nearby Battery Park City, members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot (9.1 m) steel beam installed onto the building's base [53] [54] It was welded onto the building's base on December 19, 2006 [55] Foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward, so the tower's footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year [56] An estimate in February 2007 placed the initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 per square foot ($12,400/m2) [57]\n\n\nTopping-out and completion\nBy March 2012, One WTC's steel structure had reached 93 stories, [70] growing to the 94th story (labeled as floor 100 [71]) and 1,240 feet (380 m) by the end of the month [71]  The tower's estimated cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building in the world at the time [3] [4] The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1 billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks [57] The State of New York provided an additional $250 million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1 billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds [72] The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56 percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction [4] [73]\n\n\nOpening and early years\nOn November 1, 2014, moving trucks started moving items for Condé Nast The New York Times noted that the area around the World Trade Center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms, residences, and luxury shops, coincident with the building of the new tower [92] The building opened on November 3, 2014, and Condé Nast employees moved into 24 floors [93] [94] [11] [95] Condé Nast occupied floors 20 to 44, having completed its move in early 2015 [92] It was expected that the company would attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40% of unleased space in the tower, [92] as Condé Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999 [96] Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into One WTC on the first day At the time, future tenants included Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, [97] and GQ [96] On November 12, 2014, shortly after the building opened supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked, trapping a two-man window washing team [98] [99] [100] During the late 2010s, The Durst Organization leased most of the remaining vacant space The tower reached 92 percent occupancy just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020 [101]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMany of Daniel Libeskind's original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty [113] [114] [115] [116] One World Trade Center is considered the first major building whose construction is based upon a three-dimensional Building Information Model [117]\n\n\nForm and facade\nThe building occupies a 200-foot (61 m) square, with an area of 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2), nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers The tower is built upon a 185-foot (56 m) tall windowless concrete base, designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks [121] From the 20th floor upwards, the square edges of the tower's cubic base are chamfered back, shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles, or an elongated square antiprism [122] Near its middle, the tower forms a perfect octagon, and then culminates in a glass parapet, whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base A 407.9-foot (124.3 m) sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna – designed in a collaboration between Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), artist Kenneth Snelson (who invented the tensegrity structure), lighting designers, and engineers – is secured by a system of cables, and rises from a circular support ring, which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment At night, an intense beam of light is projected vertically from the spire [2] and shines over 1,000 feet (300 m) above the tower [123]\n\n\nFeatures\nWorld Trade Center's website describes One World Trade Center's top floor as floor 104, [2] though the tower only contains 94 actual stories according to the Skyscraper Center [5] The building has 86 usable above-ground floors, of which 78 are intended for office purposes (approximately 2,600,000 square feet (240,000 m2)) [2] [130] [131] The base consists of floors 1–19, including a 65-foot-high (20 m) public lobby that features the 90-foot (27 m) mural ONE: Union of the Senses by American artist José Parlá [132] [133] The lobby also contains two paintings by Donald Martiny, called Lenape and Unami;

It is the main building of the redeveloped World Trade Center complex, which opened on November 3, 2014.\n\n**History**\n\nThe construction of the original World Trade Center was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by David Rockefeller. The project was intended to help revitalize Lower Manhattan. The project was planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which hired architect Minoru Yamasaki. The twin towers at 1 and 2 World Trade Center were designed as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. One World Trade Center was the North Tower, and Two World Trade Center was the South Tower. Each tower was over 1,350 feet (410 m) high, and occupied about 1 acre (0.40 ha) of the total 16 acres (6.5 ha) of the site's land. Of the 110 stories in each tower, 8 were set aside as mechanical floors. All the remaining floors were open for tenants. Each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) of available space. The North and South tower had 3,800,000 square feet (350,000 m2) of total office space.\n\n**Planning**\n\nFollowing the destruction of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. Already the site was becoming a tourist attraction; in the year following the attacks the Ground Zero site became the most visited place in the United States. On September 10, 2002, the Viewing Wall, a temporary display containing information about the attacks and listing the names of the dead, opened to the public.\n\n**Construction**\n\nThe symbolic cornerstone of One World Trade Center was laid in a ceremony on July 4, 2004. The stone had an inscription supposedly written by Arthur J Finkelstein. Construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money, security, and design. The last major issues were resolved on April 26, 2006, when a deal was made between developer Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on June 23, 2006. Soon after, explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the building's foundation, onto which 400 cubic yards (310 cubic meters) of concrete was poured by November 2007. In a December 18, 2006, ceremony held in nearby Battery Park City, members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot (9.1 m) steel beam installed onto the building's base. It was welded onto the building's base on December 19, 2006. Foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward, so the tower's footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year. An estimate in February 2007 placed the initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 per square foot ($12,400/m2).\n\n**Topping-out and Completion**\n\nBy March 2012, One WTC's steel structure had reached 93 stories, growing to the 94th story (labeled as floor 100) and 1,240 feet (380 m) by the end of the month. The tower's estimated cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building in the world at the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1 billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250 million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1 billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56% toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction. On November 1, 2014, moving trucks started moving items for Condé Nast. The New York Times noted that the area around the World Trade Center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms, residences, and luxury shops, coincident with the building of the new tower. The building opened on November 3, 2014, and Condé Nast employees moved into 24 floors. Condé Nast occupied floors 20 to 44, having completed its move in early 2015. It was expected that the company would attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40% of unleased space in the tower, as Condé Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999. Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into One WTC on the first day. At the time, future tenants included Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, and GQ. On November 12, 2014, shortly after the building opened, supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked, trapping a two-man window washing team.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nMany of Daniel Libeskind's original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty. One World Trade Center is considered the first major building whose construction is based upon a three-dimensional Building Information Model.\n\n**Form and Facade**\n\nThe building occupies a 200-foot (61 m) square, with an area of 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2), nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers. The tower is built upon a 185-foot (56 m) tall windowless concrete base, designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks. From the 20th floor upwards, the square edges of the tower's cubic base are chamfered back, shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles, or an elongated square antiprism. Near its middle, the tower forms a perfect octagon, and then culminates in a glass parapet, whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base. A 407.9-foot (124.3 m) sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna, designed in a collaboration between Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), artist Kenneth Snelson (who invented the tensegrity structure), lighting designers, and engineers, is secured by a system of cables, and rises from a circular support ring, which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment. At night, an intense beam of light is projected vertically from the spire and shines over 1,000 feet (300 m) above the tower.\n\n**Features**\n\nWorld Trade Center's website describes One World Trade Center's top floor as floor 104, although the tower only contains 94 actual stories according to the Skyscraper Center. The building has 86 usable above-ground floors, of which 78 are intended for office purposes (approximately 2,600,000 square feet (240,000 m2)). The base consists of floors 1-19, including a 65-foot-high (20 m) public lobby that features the 90-foot (27 m) mural ONE: Union of the Senses by American artist José Parlá. The lobby also contains two paintings by Donald Martiny, called Lenape and Unami; two paintings by Fritz Bultman, Gravity of Nightfall and Blue Triptych - Intrusion Into the Blue; and two paintings by Doug Argue, Randomly Placed Exact Percentages and Isotropic.\n\n**One World Observatory**\n\nThe tower has an observation deck on floors 100-102. Its height is 1,268 feet (386 m), making it the highest vantage point in New York City. Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors to the observation deck and tenants have their own separate entrances; one entrance is on the West Street side of the building, and the other is from within the shopping mall, descending down to a below-ground security screening area. On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, but there is a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events on the 102nd floor. The observation deck is operated by Legends Hospitality, partially owned by the New York Yankees.\n\n**Sustainability**\n\nLike other buildings in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80% of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8 MW of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.\n\n**Security Features**\n\nAlong with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base, a number of other safety features were included in the building's design, so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack. Like 7 World Trade Center, the building has 3-foot (91 cm) thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells, elevator shafts, risers, and sprinkler systems. There are also extra-wide, pressurized stairwells, along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters, and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system.\n\n**Design Evolution**\n\nThe original design went through significant changes after The Durst Organization joined the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as the project's co-developer in 2010.\n\n**Height**\n\nThe top floor of One World Trade Center is 1,368 feet (417 m) above ground level, along with a 33.4-inch (10.16 m) parapet; this is identical to the roof height of the original One World Trade Center. The tower's spire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1,776 feet (541 m), a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776, when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. When the spire is included in the building's height, as stated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), One World Trade Center surpasses the height of Taipei 101 (1,671-foot (509 m)), is the world's tallest all-office building, and the seventh-tallest skyscraper in the world as of May 2023, behind the Burj Khalifa, Merdeka 118, Shanghai Tower, Abraj Al Bait, Ping An Finance Centre, and Lotte World Tower.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nIn September 2013, three BASE jumpers parachuted off the then-under-construction tower. The three men and one accomplice on the ground surrendered to authorities in March 2014. They were convicted of several misdemeanors in June 2015 and sentenced to community service and a fine.\n\n**Reception**\n\nWhen the building was completed, The New York Times architectural critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that \"its mirrored exterior is opaque, shellacked, monomaniacal\" and that the building looked the same from each compass direction. Kimmelman felt that the building implied \"a metropolis bereft of fresh ideas\" and disliked the symbolic height of 1,368 feet (417 m), which he saw as \"abrupt\". Another critic, Blair Kamin of the Chicago Tribune, called it \"a bold but flawed giant\" whose antenna was inferior compared with the spires of the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building. Yet another writer, for Architect magazine, viewed the building as bland even when it was being constructed. Architectural Digest called it \"a symbol of strength, resilience, and hope\" in 2021.\n\n**Owners and Tenants**\n\nOne World Trade Center is principally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5% equity of the building was sold to The Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100 million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55% of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8% by November 2014.\n\n**Key Figures**\n\nLarry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, the leaseholder and developer of the complex, retains control of the surrounding buildings, while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself. Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001, and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site's redevelopment process.\n\n**Developer**\n\nLarry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, the leaseholder and developer of the complex, retains control of the surrounding buildings, while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself. Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001, and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site's redevelopment process.\n\n**Key Project Coordinators**\n\nDavid Childs, one of Silverstein's favorite architects, joined the project after being urged by him. Childs developed a design for One World Trade Center, initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind. In May 2005, Childs revised the design to address security concerns. He is the architect of the tower, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development.\n\n**Port Authority Construction Workers**\n\nA WoodSearch Films short-subject documentary entitled How does it feel to work on One World Trade Center? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31, 2010. It depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* One World Trade Center (disambiguation)\n* World Trade Center (disambiguation)\n* Lower Manhattan\n* New York City\n* Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\n* Silverstein Properties\n* One World Trade Center (disambiguation)\n* 7 World Trade Center\n* 4 World Trade Center\n* 3 World Trade Center\n* 2 World Trade Center\n* 1 World Trade Center\n* Ground Zero\n* National September 11 Memorial & Museum\n* One World Observatory\n* Skyscraper\n* Building\n* Architecture\n* Engineering\n* Construction\n* Urban planning\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The original World Trade Center was a complex of seven buildings.\n* The original World Trade Center was destroyed in the September 11 attacks.\n* The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was the primary developer of the original World Trade Center.\n* The original World Trade Center was completed in 1973.\n* The original World Trade Center was redeveloped after the September 11 attacks.\n* The redevelopment of the original World Trade Center was led by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n* The redevelopment of the original World Trade Center included the construction of One World Trade Center.\n* One World Trade Center was designed by the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.\n* One World Trade Center was completed in 2014.\n* One World Trade Center is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.\n* One World Trade Center is the sixth-tallest building in the world.\n* One World Trade Center is a symbol of the resilience and strength of the people of New York City.\n* One World Trade Center is a symbol of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"One World Trade Center\" (2014).

however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction [4] [73]\n\n\nOpening and early years\nOn November 1, 2014, moving trucks started moving items for Condé Nast The New York Times noted that the area around the World Trade Center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms, residences, and luxury shops, coincident with the building of the new tower [92] The building opened on November 3, 2014, and Condé Nast employees moved into 24 floors [93] [94] [11] [95] Condé Nast occupied floors 20 to 44, having completed its move in early 2015 [92] It was expected that the company would attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40% of unleased space in the tower, [92] as Condé Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999 [96] Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into One WTC on the first day At the time, future tenants included Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, [97] and GQ [96] On November 12, 2014, shortly after the building opened supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked, trapping a two-man window washing team [98] [99] [100] During the late 2010s, The Durst Organization leased most of the remaining vacant space The tower reached 92 percent occupancy just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020 [101]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMany of Daniel Libeskind's original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty [113] [114] [115] [116] One World Trade Center is considered the first major building whose construction is based upon a three-dimensional Building Information Model [117]\n\n\nForm and facade\nThe building occupies a 200-foot (61 m) square, with an area of 40,000 square feet (3,700 m2), nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers The tower is built upon a 185-foot (56 m) tall windowless concrete base, designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks [121] From the 20th floor upwards, the square edges of the tower's cubic base are chamfered back, shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles, or an elongated square antiprism [122] Near its middle, the tower forms a perfect octagon, and then culminates in a glass parapet, whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base A 407.9-foot (124.3 m) sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna – designed in a collaboration between Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), artist Kenneth Snelson (who invented the tensegrity structure), lighting designers, and engineers – is secured by a system of cables, and rises from a circular support ring, which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment At night, an intense beam of light is projected vertically from the spire [2] and shines over 1,000 feet (300 m) above the tower [123]\n\n\nFeatures\nWorld Trade Center's website describes One World Trade Center's top floor as floor 104, [2] though the tower only contains 94 actual stories according to the Skyscraper Center [5] The building has 86 usable above-ground floors, of which 78 are intended for office purposes (approximately 2,600,000 square feet (240,000 m2)) [2] [130] [131] The base consists of floors 1–19, including a 65-foot-high (20 m) public lobby that features the 90-foot (27 m) mural ONE: Union of the Senses by American artist José Parlá [132] [133] The lobby also contains two paintings by Donald Martiny, called Lenape and Unami; [134] two paintings by Fritz Bultman, Gravity of Nightfall and Blue Triptych – Intrusion Into the Blue; [135] and two paintings by Doug Argue, Randomly Placed Exact Percentages and Isotropic [135]\n\n\nOne World Observatory\nThe tower has an observation deck on floors 100–102 [143] Its height is 1,268 feet (386 m), making it the highest vantage point in New York City [43] Similar to the Empire State Building, visitors to the observation deck and tenants have their own separate entrances; one entrance is on the West Street side of the building, and the other is from within the shopping mall, descending down to a below-ground security screening area [144] On the observation deck, the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor, but there is a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor [145]  The observation deck is operated by Legends Hospitality, partially owned by the New York Yankees [146]\n\n\nSustainability\nLike other buildings in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80 percent of the tower's waste products are recycled [157] Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8 megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity [158] The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed [159] The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power [160] The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs [123] Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site [161] One World Trade Center received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world [162]\n\n\nSecurity features\nAlong with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base, a number of other safety features were included in the building's design, so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack Like 7 World Trade Center, the building has 3-foot (91 cm) thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells, elevator shafts, risers, and sprinkler systems There are also extra-wide, pressurized stairwells, along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters, and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system [123] [163] In comparison, the original Twin Towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions, protected only by lightweight drywall panels [164]\n\n\nDesign evolution\nThe original design went through significant changes after The Durst Organization joined the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as the project's co-developer in 2010 [113]\n\n\nHeight\nThe top floor of One World Trade Center is 1,368 feet (417 m) above ground level, along with a 33 ft 4 in (10.16 m) parapet; this is identical to the roof height of the original One World Trade Center [172] The tower's spire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1,776 feet (541 m), [5] [173] a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776, when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed [2] [174] When the spire is included in the building's height, as stated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), One World Trade Center surpasses the height of Taipei 101 (1,671-foot (509 m)), is the world's tallest all-office building, and the seventh-tallest skyscraper in the world as of May 2023 [update], behind the Burj Khalifa, [175] Merdeka 118, Shanghai Tower, [176] Abraj Al Bait, [177] Ping An Finance Centre and Lotte World Tower [178]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn September 2013, three BASE jumpers parachuted off the then-under-construction tower The three men and one accomplice on the ground surrendered to authorities in March 2014 [188] They were convicted of several misdemeanors in June 2015 [189] and sentenced to community service and a fine [190] [191]\n\n\nReception\nWhen the building was completed, The New York Times architectural critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that \"its mirrored exterior is opaque, shellacked, monomaniacal\" and that the building looked the same from each compass direction [199] Kimmelman felt that the building implied \"a metropolis bereft of fresh ideas\" and disliked the symbolic height of 1,368 feet (417 m), which he saw as \"abrupt\" [199] [200] Another critic, Blair Kamin of the Chicago Tribune, called it \"a bold but flawed giant\" whose antenna was inferior compared with the spires of the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building [201] Yet another writer, for Architect magazine, viewed the building as bland even when it was being constructed [90] Architectural Digest called it \"a symbol of strength, resilience, and hope\" in 2021 [202]\n\n\nOwners and tenants\nOne World Trade Center is principally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Around 5 percent equity of the building was sold to The Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100 million The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations [210] [211] By September 2012, around 55 percent of the building's floor space had been leased, [212] but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; [213] the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8 percent by November 2014 [214]\n\n\nKey figures\nLarry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, the leaseholder and developer of the complex, retains control of the surrounding buildings, while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001, and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site's redevelopment process [237]\n\n\nDeveloper\nLarry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, the leaseholder and developer of the complex, retains control of the surrounding buildings, while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001, and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site's redevelopment process [237]\n\n\nKey project coordinators\nDavid Childs, one of Silverstein's favorite architects, joined the project after being urged by him Childs developed a design for One World Trade Center, initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind In May 2005, Childs revised the design to address security concerns He is the architect of the tower, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development [248]\n\n\nPort Authority construction workers\nA WoodSearch Films short-subject documentary entitled How does it feel to work on One World Trade Center? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31, 2010 It depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site [258] However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration [259]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

unusual for black people to have large landholdings The asset was gradually depleted as they sold small portions of land over time, to resolve the continued legal troubles of a close relative, which later led to the entire family relocating to Newark during the Great Migration a decade before Houston's birth [4]  Houston has claimed to be part Dutch and part Native American descent due to her grandparents Susan Bell (née Fuller) and John Drinkard Jr respectively [4]\n\n\nCareer\nHouston first began singing in the sibling jubilee quartet, the Drinkard Four, at the age of five A little while later, they changed the name to the Drinkard Jubilairs and then, after the inclusions of sisters Lee and Marie (\"Reebie\"), the Drinkard Singers Houston contended in her 2013 book, Remembering Whitney: A Mother's Story of Love, Loss and the Night the Music Died, that the group didn't sing professionally until radio announcer Joe Bostic hired them to open for Clara Ward and Mahalia Jackson at the first ever gospel showcase, named the \"Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival\" at Carnegie Hall in October 1951 Not long after that, the group sang on Bostic's Gospel Train New York radio

the youngest of eight children [1] [2] [3] Houston was the granddaughter of a black landowner in Blakely, Georgia, who later shared the land he owned with Houston's father Nitch during a time when it was unusual for black people to have large landholdings The asset was gradually depleted as they sold small portions of land over time, to resolve the continued legal troubles of a close relative, which later led to the entire family relocating to Newark during the Great Migration a decade before Houston's birth [4]  Houston has claimed to be part Dutch and part Native American descent due to her grandparents Susan Bell (née Fuller) and John Drinkard Jr respectively [4]\n\n\nCareer\nHouston first began singing in the sibling jubilee quartet, the Drinkard Four, at the age of five A little while later, they changed the name to the Drinkard Jubilairs and then, after the inclusions of sisters Lee and Marie (\"Reebie\"), the Drinkard Singers Houston contended in her 2013 book, Remembering Whitney: A Mother's Story of Love, Loss and the Night the Music Died, that the group didn't sing professionally until radio announcer Joe Bostic hired them to open for Clara Ward and Mahalia Jackson at the first ever gospel showcase, named the \"Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival\" at Carnegie Hall in October 1951 Not long after that, the group sang on Bostic's Gospel Train New York radio

The tension was palpable, and it was all being caught on film [12]\n\n\nTwickenham rehearsals\nIt was a disaster They were still exhausted from the marathon The Beatles sessions Paul bossed George around; George was moody and resentful John would not even go to the bathroom without Yoko at his side .. The tension was palpable, and it was all being caught on film [12]\n\n\nApple sessions\nDuring a meeting on 15 January, the band agreed to Harrison's terms for returning to the group: they would abandon the plan to stage a public concert and move from the cavernous soundstage at Twickenham to their Apple Studio, where they would be filmed recording a new album, using the material they had gathered to that point [14] [34] The band's return to work was delayed by the poor quality of the recording and mixing equipment designed by Lennon's friend \"Magic\" Alex Mardas [35] and installed at Apple Studio, in the basement of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row Producer George Martin, who had been only a marginal presence at Twickenham, arranged to borrow two four-track recorders from EMI Studios; [36] he and audio engineer Glyn Johns then prepared the facility for the Beatles' use [35]\n\n\nRooftop concert\nAccording to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, it is uncertain who thought of a rooftop concert, but the idea was conceived just days before the actual event [39] In Preston's recollection, it was John Lennon who suggested it [40]\n\n\nGet Back mixes\nIn early March, Lennon and McCartney called Johns to Abbey Road and offered him free rein to compile an album from the Get Back recordings [47] Johns booked time at Olympic Studios between 10 March and 28 May to mix the album and completed the final banded master tape on 28 May Only one track, \"One After 909\", was taken from the rooftop concert, with \"I've Got a Feeling\" and \"Dig a Pony\" (then called \"All I Want Is You\") being studio recordings instead Johns also favoured earlier, rougher versions of \"Two of Us\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" over the more polished performances from the final, 31 January session (which were eventually chosen for the Let It Be film; the Let It Be album used the 31 January take of \"Two of Us\" but the same 26 January take of \"The Long and Winding Road\" that Johns had used) It also included a jam called \"Rocker\", a brief rendition of the Drifters' \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", Lennon's \"Don't Let Me Down\" and a four-minute edit of \"Dig It\" [48] [nb 2] A tape copy of this acetate would later make its way to the United States, where it was played on radio stations in Buffalo and Boston over September 1969 [50]\n\n\nFinal mixing\n\nProducer Phil Spector was invited by Lennon and Harrison to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned Get Back recording sessions into a usable album [59] The songs \"Get Back\" and \"Don't Let Me Down\" had been released on a single in April 1969 and \"Let It Be\" was the A-side of the band's March 1970 single [60] To coincide with the single, the project was renamed Let It Be The film, now with the new title, was premiered in New York City on 13 May 1970 One week later, UK premieres were held at the Liverpool Gaumont Cinema and the London Pavilion None of the Beatles attended any of the premieres [61]\n\nPackaging\nIn most countries except the United States, [51] the Let It Be LP was originally presented in a box with a full colour book The book contained photos by Ethan Russell from the January 1969 filming, dialogue from the film, with all expletives removed at EMI's insistence, and essays by Rolling Stone writers Jonathan Cott and David Dalton [51] [67] Despite the new album title, the book was still titled Get Back [68] Its inclusion was another step in the Beatles' efforts to provide increasingly elaborate packaging for their records since Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [51] The book's lavishness increased production costs by 33 per cent, however, [69] driving the retail price higher than for any previous Beatles album [70]\n\n\nCritical reception and legacy\nLet It Be topped album charts in both the US and the UK, and the \"Let It Be\" single and \"The Long and Winding Road\" also reached number one in the US Despite its commercial success, according to Beatles Diary author Keith Badman, \"reviews  [were] not good\" [81] NME critic Alan Smith wrote: \"If the new Beatles' soundtrack is to be their last then it will stand as a cheapskate epitaph, a cardboard tombstone, a sad and tatty end to a musical fusion which wiped clean and drew again the face of pop.\" [82] Smith added that the album showed \"contempt for the intelligence of today's record-buyer\" and that the Beatles had \"sold out all the principles for which they ever stood\" [83] Reviewing for Rolling Stone, John Mendelsohn was also critical of the album, citing Spector's production embellishments as a weakness: \"Musically, boys, you passed the audition In terms of having the judgment to avoid either over-producing yourselves or casting the fate of your get-back statement to the most notorious of all over-producers, you didn't.\" [84]\n\n\nReissues\nIn 1976, the United Artists release of the Let It Be album went out of print in America until 1979, when United Artists Records was acquired by Capitol Records Let It Be  was reissued on the Capitol label, catalogue number SW 11922;

The album marked a significant shift in the band's sound and style, as they began to explore new musical directions and experiment with psychedelic and avant-garde sounds. However, the recording sessions for the album were marked by tension and conflict within the band, with each member pushing their own creative vision.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Beatles completed the five-month sessions for their self-titled double album in mid-October 1968. While the sessions had revealed deep divisions within the group for the first time, leading to Ringo Starr quitting for three weeks, the band enjoyed the opportunity to re-engage with ensemble playing, as a departure from the psychedelic experimentation that had characterized their recordings since the band's retirement from live performance in August 1966.\n\nBefore the White Album's release, John Lennon enthused to music journalist Jonathan Cott that the Beatles were \"coming out of our shell... kind of saying: remember what it was like to play?\" George Harrison welcomed the return to the band's roots, saying that they were aiming \"to get as funky as we were in the Cavern.\"\n\n# Recording and Production\n\nThe recording sessions for the Let It Be album were held in January and February 1969 at Apple Studios in London. The band had been working on a new album, which was initially titled Get Back, but the project was put on hold as the band's creative differences became more apparent.\n\nDuring the sessions, the band's dynamics were strained, with John Lennon and Paul McCartney frequently clashing over their songwriting contributions. George Harrison was also at odds with the other two, feeling that his contributions were being overlooked. Ringo Starr, who had been absent for part of the sessions, returned to find the band's tensions running high.\n\nIn an effort to revitalize the project, producer Phil Spector was brought in to work with the band. Spector's production style was at odds with the band's, and he began to add orchestral arrangements and other embellishments to the recordings. However, the band was not happy with Spector's work, and they eventually distanced themselves from the project.\n\n# Twickenham Rehearsals\n\nBefore the Apple sessions, the band had held a series of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios in London. The rehearsals were tense and often chaotic, with the band struggling to work together effectively.\n\nDuring the rehearsals, Paul McCartney dominated the proceedings, dictating the band's direction and pushing his own creative vision. George Harrison was at odds with McCartney, feeling that he was being marginalized and overlooked. John Lennon was also frustrated, feeling that the band was not living up to its potential.\n\nRingo Starr, who had been absent for part of the rehearsals, returned to find the band's tensions running high. He was particularly disheartened by the band's decision to stage a public concert, which he felt would be a disaster.\n\n# Apple Sessions\n\nIn January 1969, the band reconvened at Apple Studios to work on the Get Back project. The sessions were marked by tension and conflict, with the band struggling to work together effectively.\n\nDuring the sessions, John Lennon and Yoko Ono were present, and they began to exert a significant influence on the band's music. George Harrison was at odds with Lennon and Ono, feeling that they were dominating the proceedings and stifling his own creative input.\n\nIn an effort to revive the project, the band decided to film their sessions, with the intention of releasing a documentary film. The film, which was eventually titled Let It Be, would showcase the band's music and provide a behind-the-scenes look at their creative process.\n\n# Rooftop Concert\n\nOn January 30, 1969, the band staged a rooftop concert on the roof of Apple Records in London. The concert, which was filmed for the Let It Be documentary, was a poignant moment in the band's history, as they bid farewell to their fans and marked the end of an era.\n\nThe concert was a spontaneous event, with the band deciding to perform on the roof at the last minute. The performance was marked by a sense of urgency and desperation, as the band knew that their time together was coming to an end.\n\n# Get Back Mixes\n\nIn early March, John Lennon and Paul McCartney called in producer Glyn Johns to work on a new mix of the Get Back recordings. Johns, who had been a key figure in the band's early years, was tasked with creating a new version of the album that would showcase the band's rock and roll sound.\n\nJohns worked tirelessly to create a new mix of the recordings, using a combination of studio and live performances. The result was a new version of the album, which was later released as Let It Be... Naked.\n\n# Final Mixing\n\nIn April 1969, Phil Spector was brought in to work on the final mixing of the Let It Be album. Spector's production style was at odds with the band's, and he began to add orchestral arrangements and other embellishments to the recordings.\n\nThe band was not happy with Spector's work, and they eventually distanced themselves from the project. However, Spector's work on the album was widely praised, and it remains one of the most iconic and enduring albums in rock history.\n\n# Packaging\n\nThe Let It Be album was released in March 1970, and it was packaged in a lavish box with a full-color book. The book contained photos from the January 1969 filming, dialogue from the film, and essays by Rolling Stone writers Jonathan Cott and David Dalton.\n\nThe book's inclusion was a significant departure from the band's previous album releases, and it marked a new level of sophistication and creativity in their packaging. The lavishness of the packaging drove up production costs, but it also helped to establish the band's reputation as innovators and visionaries.\n\n# Critical Reception and Legacy\n\nThe Let It Be album was widely praised upon its release, with many critics hailing it as a masterpiece. The album topped the charts in both the US and the UK, and the single \"Let It Be\" reached number one in the US.\n\nHowever, the album was not without its critics, with some reviewers feeling that it was overproduced and lacked the band's signature sound. Despite this, the album remains one of the most iconic and enduring albums in rock history, and it continues to be celebrated by fans and critics alike.\n\n# Reissues\n\nIn 1976, the United Artists release of the Let It Be album went out of print in America until 1979, when United Artists Records was acquired by Capitol Records. Let It Be was reissued on the Capitol label, catalogue number SW 11922; during this three-year hiatus, many counterfeit copies of the LP appeared on the market in the US.\n\n# Let It Be...

The album was presented as an alternative attempt to capture the original artistic vision of the project, to \"get back\" to the rock and roll sound of the band's early years.\n\nThe album features alternate takes, edits, and mixes of the songs, mainly removing elements added by Phil Spector. The album omits the group chatter, \"Maggie Mae,\" and \"Dig It,\" and adds a live rooftop performance of \"Don't Let Me Down,\" a song omitted from the original album and issued as the B-side of the \"Get Back\" single in 1969.\n\n# Deluxe Editions\n\nIn November 2021, The Beatles: Get Back, a new documentary directed by Peter Jackson using footage captured for the Let It Be film, was released on Disney+ as a three-part miniseries.

A book also titled The Beatles: Get Back was released in October 2021, ahead of the documentary.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Let_It_Be_(Beatles_album)\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe Beatles completed the five-month sessions for their self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\") in mid-October 1968 [5] While the sessions had revealed deep divisions within the group for the first time, leading to Ringo Starr quitting for three weeks, the band enjoyed the opportunity to re-engage with ensemble playing, as a departure from the psychedelic experimentation that had characterised their recordings since the band's retirement from live performance in August 1966 Before the White Album's release, John Lennon enthused to music journalist Jonathan Cott that the Beatles were \"coming out of our shell .. kind of saying: remember what it was like to play?\" [6] George Harrison welcomed the return to the band's roots, saying that they were aiming \"to get as funky as we were in the Cavern\" [7]\n\n\nRecording and production\nIt was a disaster They were still exhausted from the marathon The Beatles sessions Paul bossed George around; George was moody and resentful John would not even go to the bathroom without Yoko at his side .. The tension was palpable, and it was all being caught on film [12]\n\n\nTwickenham rehearsals\nIt was a disaster They were still exhausted from the marathon The Beatles sessions Paul bossed George around; George was moody and resentful John would not even go to the bathroom without Yoko at his side .. The tension was palpable, and it was all being caught on film [12]\n\n\nApple sessions\nDuring a meeting on 15 January, the band agreed to Harrison's terms for returning to the group: they would abandon the plan to stage a public concert and move from the cavernous soundstage at Twickenham to their Apple Studio, where they would be filmed recording a new album, using the material they had gathered to that point [14] [34] The band's return to work was delayed by the poor quality of the recording and mixing equipment designed by Lennon's friend \"Magic\" Alex Mardas [35] and installed at Apple Studio, in the basement of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row Producer George Martin, who had been only a marginal presence at Twickenham, arranged to borrow two four-track recorders from EMI Studios; [36] he and audio engineer Glyn Johns then prepared the facility for the Beatles' use [35]\n\n\nRooftop concert\nAccording to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, it is uncertain who thought of a rooftop concert, but the idea was conceived just days before the actual event [39] In Preston's recollection, it was John Lennon who suggested it [40]\n\n\nGet Back mixes\nIn early March, Lennon and McCartney called Johns to Abbey Road and offered him free rein to compile an album from the Get Back recordings [47] Johns booked time at Olympic Studios between 10 March and 28 May to mix the album and completed the final banded master tape on 28 May Only one track, \"One After 909\", was taken from the rooftop concert, with \"I've Got a Feeling\" and \"Dig a Pony\" (then called \"All I Want Is You\") being studio recordings instead Johns also favoured earlier, rougher versions of \"Two of Us\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" over the more polished performances from the final, 31 January session (which were eventually chosen for the Let It Be film; the Let It Be album used the 31 January take of \"Two of Us\" but the same 26 January take of \"The Long and Winding Road\" that Johns had used) It also included a jam called \"Rocker\", a brief rendition of the Drifters' \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", Lennon's \"Don't Let Me Down\" and a four-minute edit of \"Dig It\" [48] [nb 2] A tape copy of this acetate would later make its way to the United States, where it was played on radio stations in Buffalo and Boston over September 1969 [50]\n\n\nFinal mixing\n\nProducer Phil Spector was invited by Lennon and Harrison to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned Get Back recording sessions into a usable album [59] The songs \"Get Back\" and \"Don't Let Me Down\" had been released on a single in April 1969 and \"Let It Be\" was the A-side of the band's March 1970 single [60] To coincide with the single, the project was renamed Let It Be The film, now with the new title, was premiered in New York City on 13 May 1970 One week later, UK premieres were held at the Liverpool Gaumont Cinema and the London Pavilion None of the Beatles attended any of the premieres [61]\n\nPackaging\nIn most countries except the United States, [51] the Let It Be LP was originally presented in a box with a full colour book The book contained photos by Ethan Russell from the January 1969 filming, dialogue from the film, with all expletives removed at EMI's insistence, and essays by Rolling Stone writers Jonathan Cott and David Dalton [51] [67] Despite the new album title, the book was still titled Get Back [68] Its inclusion was another step in the Beatles' efforts to provide increasingly elaborate packaging for their records since Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [51] The book's lavishness increased production costs by 33 per cent, however, [69] driving the retail price higher than for any previous Beatles album [70]\n\n\nCritical reception and legacy\nLet It Be topped album charts in both the US and the UK, and the \"Let It Be\" single and \"The Long and Winding Road\" also reached number one in the US Despite its commercial success, according to Beatles Diary author Keith Badman, \"reviews  [were] not good\" [81] NME critic Alan Smith wrote: \"If the new Beatles' soundtrack is to be their last then it will stand as a cheapskate epitaph, a cardboard tombstone, a sad and tatty end to a musical fusion which wiped clean and drew again the face of pop.\" [82] Smith added that the album showed \"contempt for the intelligence of today's record-buyer\" and that the Beatles had \"sold out all the principles for which they ever stood\" [83] Reviewing for Rolling Stone, John Mendelsohn was also critical of the album, citing Spector's production embellishments as a weakness: \"Musically, boys, you passed the audition In terms of having the judgment to avoid either over-producing yourselves or casting the fate of your get-back statement to the most notorious of all over-producers, you didn't.\" [84]\n\n\nReissues\nIn 1976, the United Artists release of the Let It Be album went out of print in America until 1979, when United Artists Records was acquired by Capitol Records Let It Be  was reissued on the Capitol label, catalogue number SW 11922; during this three year hiatus, many counterfeit copies of the LP appeared on the market in the US [99]\n\n\nLet It Be... Naked\nPaul McCartney, long unhappy with the original Phil Spector produced Let It Be LP, initiated a remix of the album, titled Let It Be.. Naked which was released in 2003 The album was presented as an alternative attempt to capture the original artistic vision of the project, to \"get back\" to the rock and roll sound of the band's early years The album features alternate takes, edits, and mixes of the songs, mainly removing elements added by Spector The album omits the group chatter, \"Maggie Mae\" and \"Dig It\", and adds a live rooftop performance of \"Don't Let Me Down\", a song omitted from the original album and issued as the B side of the \"Get Back\" single in 1969 [100]\n\n\nDeluxe editions\nIn November 2021, The Beatles: Get Back, a new documentary directed by Peter Jackson using footage captured for the Let It Be film, was released on Disney+ as a three-part miniseries [101] It was originally going to be theatrically released in 2020 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Let It Be album, but was delayed to November 2021 and moved to Disney+ A book also titled The Beatles: Get Back was released in October 2021, ahead of the documentary [102]\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Lennon–McCartney, except where noted Lead vocals according to Ian MacDonald [103]\n\n\nOriginal release\nAll songs written by Lennon–McCartney, except where noted Lead vocals according to Ian MacDonald [103]\n\n\nRejected Glyn Johns versions\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn: [104]\n\n\nPersonnel\nThe Beatles\n\n\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n\n\nCertifications\n* Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Morocco", "content": "\nEtymology and name\nThe English Morocco is an anglicisation of the Spanish name for the country, Marruecos, derived from the name of the city of Marrakesh, which was the capital of the Almoravid dynasty, the Almohad Caliphate, and the Saadian dynasty [23] During the Almoravid dynasty, the city of Marrakesh was established under the name of Tāmurākušt, derived from the city's ancient Berber name of amūr n Yakuš (lit. 'land/country of God') [24] In English, the first vowel has been changed, likely influenced by the word \"Moor\" [25]\n\n\nHistory\nThe area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least Paleolithic times, beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC [36] A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: Homo sapiens fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the Atlantic coast in Jebel Irhoud were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago [37]  During the Upper Paleolithic, the Maghreb was more fertile than it is today, resembling a savanna, in contrast to its modern arid landscape [38]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nThe area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least Paleolithic times, beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC [36] A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: Homo sapiens fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the Atlantic coast in Jebel Irhoud were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago [37]  During the Upper Paleolithic, the Maghreb was more fertile than it is today, resembling a savanna, in contrast to its modern arid landscape [38]\n\n\nFoundation and dynasties\nThe Muslim conquest of the Maghreb that had begun during the mid-7th century was completed under the Umayyad Caliphate by 709 The caliphate introduced both Islam and the Arabic language to the area; this period also saw the beginning of a trend of Arab migration to the Maghreb which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region While constituting part of the larger empire, Morocco was initially organised as a subsidiary province of Ifriqiya, with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in Kairouan [45]\n\n\nFrench and Spanish protectorates\nAs Europe industrialised, Northwest Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory, but also because of the strategic position of Morocco with coasts on the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic [61] In 1860, a dispute over Spain's Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement In 1884, Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco.\n\n\nPost-independence\nSultan Mohammed became King in 1957 Upon the death of Mohammed V, Hassan II became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961 Morocco held its first general elections in 1963 However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965 In 1971 and 1972, there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.\n\n\nGeography\nMorocco has a coast by the Atlantic Ocean that reaches past the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea It is bordered by Spain to the north (a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish-controlled exclaves, Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera), Algeria to the east, and Western Sahara to the south Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its de facto southern boundary is with Mauritania [98]\n\n\nClimate\nIn area, Morocco's climate is mainly \"hot summer Mediterranean\" (Csa) and \"hot desert\" (BWh) zones [106]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nMorocco has a wide range of biodiversity It is part of the Mediterranean basin, an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss, and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority [113] Avifauna are notably variant [114] The avifauna of Morocco includes a total of 454 species, five of which have been introduced by humans, and 156 are rarely or accidentally seen [115]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAccording to the 2022 Economist Democracy Index, Morocco is ruled under a hybrid regime, scoring #3 in the Middle East and North Africa, and #95 in the world [124] Morocco has a \"difficult\" ranking on the 2023 World Press Freedom Index [125]\n\n\nLegislative branch\nSince the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers The Assembly of Representatives of Morocco (Majlis an-Nuwwâb/Assemblée des Répresentants) has 395 members elected for a five-year term, 305 elected in multi-seat constituencies and 90 in national lists consisting of women and youth.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nMorocco is officially divided into 12 regions, [134] which, in turn, are subdivided into 62 provinces and 13 prefectures [135]\n\n\nForeign relations\nMorocco is a member of the United Nations and belongs to the African Union (AU), Arab League, Arab Maghreb Union (UMA), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States (CEN_SAD) Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab, and Western states Morocco has had strong ties to the West in order to gain economic and political benefits [136] France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco From the total foreign investments in Morocco, the European Union invests approximately 73.5%, whereas, the Arab world invests only 19.3% Many countries from the Persian Gulf and Maghreb regions are getting more involved in large-scale development projects in Morocco [137]\n\n\nWestern Sahara status\nThe status of the Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro regions is disputed The Western Sahara War saw the Polisario Front, the Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement, battling both Morocco and Mauritania between 1976 and a ceasefire in 1991 that is still in effect A United Nations mission, MINURSO, is tasked with organising a referendum on whether the territory should become independent or recognised as a part of Morocco.\n\n\nMilitary\nMorocco's military consists of the Royal Armed Forces—this includes the Army (the largest branch), the Navy, the Air Force, the Royal Guard, the Royal Gendarmerie and the Auxiliary Forces Internal security is generally effective, and acts of political violence are rare (with one exception, the 2003 Casablanca bombings which killed 45 people [148]).\n\n\nHuman rights\nDuring the early 1960s to the late 1980s, under the leadership of Hassan II, Morocco had one of the worst human rights records in both Africa and the world Government repression of political dissent was widespread during Hassan II's leadership, until it dropped sharply in the mid-1990s The decades during which abuses were committed are referred to as the Years of Lead (les années de plomb), and included forced disappearances, assassinations of government opponents and protesters, and secret internment camps such as Tazmamart To examine abuses committed during the reign of King Hassan II (1961–1999), the government under King Mohammed  set up an Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER) [149] [150]\n\n\nEconomy\nMorocco's economy is considered a relatively liberal economy governed by the law of supply and demand Since 1993, the country has followed a policy of privatisation of certain economic sectors which used to be in the hands of the government [160] Morocco has become a major player in African economic affairs, [161] and is the sixth largest economy in Africa by GDP (PPP) Morocco was ranked as the first African country by the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality-of-life index, ahead of South Africa [162] However, in the years since that first-place ranking was given, Morocco has slipped into fourth place behind Egypt.\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is one of the most important sectors in Moroccan economy It is well developed with a strong tourist industry focused on the country's coast, culture, and history Morocco attracted more than 13 million tourists in 2019 Tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco after the phosphate industry The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development, in 2010 the government launched its Vision 2020 which plans to make Morocco one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world and to double the annual number of international arrivals to 20 million by 2020, [164] with the hope that tourism will then have risen to 20% of GDP.\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture in Morocco employs about 40% of the nation's workforce Thus, it is the largest employer in the country In the rainy sections of the northwest, barley, wheat, and other cereals can be raised without irrigation On the Atlantic coast, where there are extensive plains, olives, citrus fruits, and wine grapes are grown, largely with water supplied by artesian wells Livestock are raised and forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials Part of the maritime population fishes for its livelihood Agadir, Essaouira, El Jadida, and Larache are among the important fishing harbors [171] Both the agriculture and fishing industries are expected to be severely impacted by climate change [172] [173]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2019, Morocco Ranked 32nd in the world in terms of Roads, 16th in Sea, 45th in Air and 64th in Railways This gives Morocco the best infrastructure rankings in the African continent [175]\n\n\nEnergy\nIn 2008, about 56% of Morocco's electricity supply was provided by coal [178] However, as forecasts indicate that energy requirements in Morocco will rise 6% per year between 2012 and 2050, [179] a new law passed encouraging Moroccans to look for ways to diversify the energy supply, including more renewable resources The Moroccan government has launched a project to build a solar thermal energy power plant [180] and is also looking into the use of natural gas as a potential source of revenue for Morocco's government [179]\n\n\nNarcotics\nSince the 7th century, cannabis has been cultivated in the Rif region [182] In 2004, according to the UN World Drugs Report, cultivation and transformation of cannabis represents 0.57% of the national GDP of Morocco in 2002 [183] According to a French Ministry of the Interior 2006 report, 80% of the cannabis resin (hashish) consumed in Europe comes from the Rif region in Morocco, which is mostly mountainous terrain in the north of Morocco, also hosting plains that are very fertile and expanding from Melwiyya River and Ras Kebdana in the East to Tangier and Cape Spartel in the West Also, the region extends from the Mediterranean in the south, home of the Wergha River, to the north [184] In addition to that, Morocco is a transit point for cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe [185]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nWater supply and sanitation in Morocco is provided by a wide array of utilities They range from private companies in the largest city, Casablanca, the capital, Rabat,\nand two other cities, [clarification needed] to public municipal utilities in 13 other cities, as well as a national electricity and water company (ONEE) The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.\n\n\nScience and technology\nThe Moroccan government has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia He announced that investment in science and technology would rise from US$620,000 in 2008 to US$8.5 million (69 million Moroccan dirhams) in 2009, in order to finance the refurbishment and construction of laboratories, training courses for researchers in financial management, a scholarship programme for postgraduate research and incentive measures for companies prepared to finance research, such as giving them access to scientific results that they could then use to develop new products [187] Morocco was ranked 66th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [188]\n\n\nDemographics\nMorocco has a population of around 37,076,584 inhabitants (2021 est.) [192] [193] Morocco's population was 11.6 million in 1960 [194] According to the 2014 Morocco population census, there were around 84,000 immigrants in the country Of these foreign-born residents, most were of French origin, followed by individuals mainly from various nations in West Africa and Algeria [195] There are also a number of foreign residents of Spanish origin Some of them are descendants of colonial settlers, who primarily work for European multinational companies, while others are married to Moroccans or are retirees Prior to independence, Morocco was home to half a million Europeans; who were mostly Christians [196] Also, prior to independence, Morocco was home to 250,000 Spaniards [197] Morocco's once prominent Jewish minority has decreased significantly since its peak of 265,000 in 1948, declining to around 3,500 in 2022 [198]\n\n\nPopulation\nMorocco has a population of around 37,076,584 inhabitants (2021 est.)

its peak of 265,000 in 1948, declining to around 3,500 in 2022 [198]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nIn Morocco, ethnic identity is strongly correlated with language and culture [203] Arabs form the largest and majority ethnic group, [204] [205] making up between 65% [206] [207] and 80% [206] [207] [208] of the Moroccan population It is estimated that the indigenous Berbers constitute between 30% [206] [204] [205] and 35% of the population [209] [210] According to Encyclopædia Britannica, Morocco's population is composed of 44% Arabs, 24% Arabized Berbers, 21% Berbers, 10% Mauritanian Moors, and 1% others [211] Berbers are divided into three main groups with varying languages who live spread out in rural mountain areas, namely the Rifians in the Rif, the Zayanes in the Middle Atlas, and the Shilha people in the Anti-Atlas [205] Centuries of Arab migrations to the Maghreb from the Arabian Peninsula since the 7th century have significantly altered Morocco's demographic landscape, both culturally and genetically [212] A sizeable portion of the population is identified as Haratin and Gnawa (or Gnaoua), West African or mixed-race descendants of slaves, and Moriscos, European Muslims expelled from Spain and Portugal in the 17th century [213]\n\n\nReligion\nThe religious affiliation in the country was estimated by the Pew Forum in 2010 as 99% Muslim, with all remaining groups accounting for less than 1% of the population [214] Of those affiliated with Islam, virtually all are Sunni Muslims, with Shia Muslims accounting for less than 0.1% [215] However, nearly 15% of Moroccans nonetheless describe themselves as non religious according to a 2018 survey conducted by the research network Arab Barometer; the same survey saw nearly 100 percent of respondents identify as Muslims [216] Another 2021 Arab Barometer survey found that 67.8% of Moroccans identified as religious, 29.1% as somewhat religious, and 3.1% as non religious [217] The 2015 Gallup International poll reported that 93% of Moroccans considered themselves to be religious [218]\n\n\nLanguages\nMorocco's official languages are Arabic and Berber [8] [231] The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as Darija Approximately 89.8% of the whole population can communicate to some degree in Moroccan Arabic [232] The Berber language is spoken in three dialects (Tarifit, Tashelhit and Central Atlas Tamazight) [233] In 2008, Frédéric Deroche estimated that there were 12 million Berber speakers, making up about 40% of the population [234] The 2004 population census reported that 28.1% of the population spoke Berber [232]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school The estimated literacy rate for the country in 2012 was 72% [240] In September 2006, UNESCO awarded Morocco amongst other countries such as Cuba, Pakistan, India and Turkey the \"UNESCO 2006 Literacy Prize\" [241]\n\n\nHealth\nMany efforts are made by countries around the world to address health issues and eradicate disease, Morocco included Child health, maternal health, and diseases are all components of health and well-being Morocco is a developing country that has made many strides to improve these categories However, Morocco still has many health issues to improve on According to research published, in 2005 only 16% of citizens in Morocco had health insurance or coverage [247] In data from the World Bank, Morocco experiences high infant mortality rates at 20 deaths per 1,000 births (2017) [248] and high maternal mortality rates at 121 deaths per 100,000 births (2015) [249]\n\n\nCulture\nMorocco is a country with a rich culture and civilisation Through Moroccan history, it has hosted many people All of whom have affected the social structure of Morocco.\n\n\nArchitecture\nMoroccan architecture reflects Morocco's diverse geography and long history, marked by successive waves of settlers through both migration and military conquest This architectural heritage includes ancient Roman sites, historic Islamic architecture, local vernacular architecture, 20th-century French colonial architecture, and modern architecture.\n\n\nLiterature\nMoroccan literature is written mostly in Arabic, Berber, Hebrew, and French Particularly under the Almoravid and Almohad empires, Moroccan literature was closely related to the literature of al-Andalus, and shared important poetic and literary forms such as zajal, the muwashshah, and the maqama Islamic literature, such as Quranic exegeses and other religious works such as Qadi Ayyad's Al-Shifa were influential The University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fes was an important literary centre attracting scholars from abroad, including Maimonides, Ibn al-Khatib, and Ibn Khaldun.\n\n\nMusic\nMoroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins Rock-influenced chaabi bands are widespread, as is trance music with historical origins in Islamic

and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Centre  [fr] (CCM), the nation's film regulatory agency, was established Studios were also opened in Rabat.\n\n\nCuisine\nMoroccan cuisine is considered one of the most diversified cuisines in the world This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world [277] The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\n\nSport\nFootball is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular In 1986, Morocco became the first Arab and African country to qualify for the second round of the FIFA World Cup Morocco hosted the Africa Cup of Nations in 1988 and will host it again in 2025 after original host Guinea was stripped from hosting rights due to inadequacy of hosting preparations Morocco was originally scheduled to host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, [280] but refused to host the tournament on the scheduled dates because of fears over the Ebola outbreak on the continent [281] Morocco made six attempts to host the FIFA World Cup but lost five times to the United States, France, Germany, South Africa and a Canada–Mexico–United States joint bid, however Morocco will co-host it in 2030 along with Portugal and Spain having finally won the bid in their sixth attempt In 2022, Morocco became the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals and finished 4th in the tournament.\n\n\nSee

In English, the first vowel has been changed, likely influenced by the word \"Moor\".\n\n## History\n\nThe area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least Paleolithic times, beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC. A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: Homo sapiens fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the Atlantic coast in Jebel Irhoud were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago. During the Upper Paleolithic, the Maghreb was more fertile than it is today, resembling a savanna, in contrast to its modern arid landscape.\n\n## Prehistory and Antiquity\n\nThe area of present-day Morocco has been inhabited since at least Paleolithic times, beginning sometime between 190,000 and 90,000 BC. A recent publication has suggested that there is evidence for even earlier human habitation of the area: Homo sapiens fossils that had been discovered in the late 2000s near the Atlantic coast in Jebel Irhoud were recently dated to roughly 315,000 years ago. During the Upper Paleolithic, the Maghreb was more fertile than it is today, resembling a savanna, in contrast to its modern arid landscape.\n\n## Foundation and Dynasties\n\nThe Muslim conquest of the Maghreb that had begun during the mid-7th century was completed under the Umayyad Caliphate by 709. The caliphate introduced both Islam and the Arabic language to the area; this period also saw the beginning of a trend of Arab migration to the Maghreb which would last for centuries and effect a demographic shift in the region. While constituting part of the larger empire, Morocco was initially organised as a subsidiary province of Ifriqiya, with the local governors appointed by the Muslim governor in Kairouan.\n\n## French and Spanish Protectorates\n\nAs Europe industrialised, Northwest Africa was increasingly prized for its potential for colonisation. France showed a strong interest in Morocco as early as 1830, not only to protect the border of its Algerian territory, but also because of the strategic position of Morocco with coasts on the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic. In 1860, a dispute over Spain's Ceuta enclave led Spain to declare war. Victorious Spain won a further enclave and an enlarged Ceuta in the settlement. In 1884, Spain created a protectorate in the coastal areas of Morocco.\n\n## Post-independence\n\nSultan Mohammed became King in 1957. Upon the death of Mohammed V, Hassan II became King of Morocco on 3 March 1961. Morocco held its first general elections in 1963. However, Hassan declared a state of emergency and suspended parliament in 1965. In 1971 and 1972, there were two failed attempts to depose the king and establish a republic. A truth commission set up in 2005 to investigate human rights abuses during his reign confirmed nearly 10,000 cases, ranging from death in detention to forced exile. Some 592 people were recorded killed during Hassan's rule according to the truth commission.\n\n## Geography\n\nMorocco has a coast by the Atlantic Ocean that reaches past the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered by Spain to the north (a water border through the Strait and land borders with three small Spanish-controlled exclaves, Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera), Algeria to the east, and Western Sahara to the south. Since Morocco controls most of Western Sahara, its de facto southern boundary is with Mauritania.\n\n## Climate\n\nMorocco's climate is mainly \"hot summer Mediterranean\" (Csa) and \"hot desert\" (BWh) zones. The climate is generally warm and sunny throughout the year, with average temperatures varying from 10°C (50°F) in the north to 20°C (68°F) in the south. The coastal regions experience moderate temperatures, with a strong maritime influence.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nMorocco has a wide range of biodiversity. It is part of the Mediterranean basin, an area with exceptional concentrations of endemic species undergoing rapid rates of habitat loss, and is therefore considered to be a hotspot for conservation priority. Avifauna are notably variant, with a total of 454 species, five of which have been introduced by humans, and 156 are rarely or accidentally seen.\n\n## Government and Politics\n\nAccording to the 2022 Economist Democracy Index, Morocco is ruled under a hybrid regime, scoring #3 in the Middle East and North Africa, and #95 in the world. Morocco has a \"difficult\" ranking on the 2023 World Press Freedom Index.\n\n## Legislative Branch\n\nSince the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The Assembly of Representatives of Morocco (Majlis an-Nuwwâb/Assemblée des Répresentants) has 395 members elected for a five-year term, 305 elected in multi-seat constituencies and 90 in national lists consisting of women and youth.\n\n## Administrative Divisions\n\nMorocco is officially divided into 12 regions, which, in turn, are subdivided into 62 provinces and 13 prefectures.\n\n## Foreign Relations\n\nMorocco is a member of the United Nations and belongs to the African Union (AU), Arab League, Arab Maghreb Union (UMA), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Non-Aligned Movement and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States (CEN_SAD). Morocco's relationships vary greatly between African, Arab, and Western states. Morocco has had strong ties to the West in order to gain economic and political benefits. France and Spain remain the primary trade partners, as well as the primary creditors and foreign investors in Morocco.\n\n## Western Sahara Status\n\nThe status of the Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro regions is disputed. The Western Sahara War saw the Polisario Front, the Sahrawi rebel national liberation movement, battling both Morocco and Mauritania between 1976 and a ceasefire in 1991 that is still in effect. A United Nations mission, MINURSO, is tasked with organising a referendum on whether the territory should become independent or recognised as a part of Morocco.\n\n## Military\n\nMorocco's military consists of the Royal Armed Forces—this includes the Army (the largest branch), the Navy, the Air Force, the Royal Guard, the Royal Gendarmerie and the Auxiliary Forces. Internal security is generally effective, and acts of political violence are rare, with one exception, the 2003 Casablanca bombings which killed 45 people.\n\n## Human Rights\n\nDuring the early 1960s to the late 1980s, under the leadership of Hassan II, Morocco had one of the worst human rights records in both Africa and the world. Government repression of political dissent was widespread during Hassan II's leadership, until it dropped sharply in the mid-1990s. The decades during which abuses were committed are referred to as the Years of Lead (les années de plomb), and included forced disappearances, assassinations of government opponents and protesters, and secret internment camps such as Tazmamart.\n\n## Economy\n\nMorocco's economy is considered a relatively liberal economy governed by the law of supply and demand. Since 1993, the country has followed a policy of privatisation of certain economic sectors which used to be in the hands of the government. Morocco has become a major player in African economic affairs, and is the sixth largest economy in Africa by GDP (PPP). Morocco was ranked as the first African country by the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality-of-life index, ahead of South Africa.\n\n## Tourism\n\nTourism is one of the most important sectors in Moroccan economy. It is well developed with a strong tourist industry focused on the country's coast, culture, and history. Morocco attracted more than 13 million tourists in 2019. Tourism is the second largest foreign exchange earner in Morocco after the phosphate industry. The Moroccan government is heavily investing in tourism development, in 2010 the government launched its Vision 2020 which plans to make Morocco one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world and to double the annual number of international arrivals to 20 million by 2020.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nAgriculture in Morocco employs about 40% of the nation's workforce. It is the largest employer in the country. In the rainy sections of the northwest, barley, wheat, and other cereals can be raised without irrigation. On the Atlantic coast, where there are extensive plains, olives, citrus fruits, and wine grapes are grown, largely with water supplied by artesian wells. Livestock are raised and forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAccording to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2019, Morocco Ranked 32nd in the world in terms of Roads, 16th in Sea, 45th in Air and 64th in Railways. This gives Morocco the best infrastructure rankings in the African continent.\n\n## Energy\n\nIn 2008, about 56% of Morocco's electricity supply was provided by coal. However, as forecasts indicate that energy requirements in Morocco will rise 6% per year between 2012 and 2050, a new law passed encouraging Moroccans to look for ways to diversify the energy supply, including more renewable resources. The Moroccan government has launched a project to build a solar thermal energy power plant and is also looking into the use of natural gas as a potential source of revenue for Morocco's government.\n\n## Narcotics\n\nSince the 7th century, cannabis has been cultivated in the Rif region. In 2004, according to the UN World Drugs Report, cultivation and transformation of cannabis represents 0.57% of the national GDP of Morocco in 2002. According to a French Ministry of the Interior 2006 report, 80% of the cannabis resin (hashish) consumed in Europe comes from the Rif region in Morocco.\n\n## Water Supply and Sanitation\n\nWater supply and sanitation in Morocco is provided by a wide array of utilities. They range from private companies in the largest city, Casablanca, the capital, Rabat, and two other cities, to public municipal utilities in 13 other cities, as well as a national electricity and water company (ONEE). The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.\n\n## Science and Technology\n\nThe Moroccan government has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs. In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research. The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia.\n\n## Demographics\n\nMorocco has a population of around 37,076,584 inhabitants (2021 est.). Morocco's population was 11.6 million in 1960. According to the 2014 Morocco population census, there were around 84,000 immigrants in the country. Of these foreign-born residents, most were of French origin, followed by individuals mainly from various nations in West Africa and Algeria.\n\n## Population\n\nMorocco has a population of around 37,076,584 inhabitants (2021 est.).

Of these foreign-born residents, most were of French origin, followed by individuals mainly from various nations in West Africa and Algeria.\n\n## Ethnic Groups\n\nIn Morocco, ethnic identity is strongly correlated with language and culture. Arabs form the largest and majority ethnic group, making up between 65% and 80% of the Moroccan population. The indigenous Berbers constitute between 30% and 35% of the population. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, Morocco's population is composed of 44% Arabs, 24% Arabized Berbers, 21% Berbers, 10% Mauritanian Moors, and 1% others.\n\n## Religion\n\nThe religious affiliation in the country was estimated by the Pew Forum in 2010 as 99% Muslim, with all remaining groups accounting for less than 1% of the population. Of those affiliated with Islam, virtually all are Sunni Muslims, with Shia Muslims accounting for less than 0.1%. However, nearly 15% of Moroccans nonetheless describe themselves as non-religious according to a 2018 survey conducted by the research network Arab Barometer; the same survey saw nearly 100 percent of respondents identify as Muslims.\n\n## Languages\n\nMorocco's official languages are Arabic and Berber. The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as Darija. Approximately 89.8% of the whole population can communicate to some degree in Moroccan Arabic. The Berber language is spoken in three dialects (Tarifit, Tashelhit and Central Atlas Tamazight). In 2008, Frédéric Deroche estimated that there were 12 million Berber speakers, making up about 40% of the population.\n\n## Education\n\nEducation in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school. The estimated literacy rate for the country in 2012 was 72%. In September 2006, UNESCO awarded Morocco amongst other countries such as Cuba, Pakistan, India and Turkey the \"UNESCO 2006 Literacy Prize\".\n\n## Health\n\nMany efforts are made by countries around the world to address health issues and eradicate disease, Morocco included. Child health, maternal health, and diseases are all components of health and well-being. Morocco is a developing country that has made many strides to improve these categories. However, Morocco still has many health issues to improve on. According to research published, in 2005 only 16% of citizens in Morocco had health insurance or coverage. In data from the World Bank, Morocco experiences high infant mortality rates at 20 deaths per 1,000 births (2017) and high maternal mortality rates at 121 deaths per 100,000 births (2015).\n\n## Culture\n\nMorocco is a country with a rich culture and civilization. Through Moroccan history, it has hosted many people. All of whom have affected the social structure of Morocco.\n\n## Architecture\n\nMoroccan architecture reflects Morocco's diverse geography and long history, marked by successive waves of settlers through both migration and military conquest. This architectural heritage includes ancient Roman sites, historic Islamic architecture, local vernacular architecture, 20th-century French colonial architecture, and modern architecture.\n\n## Literature\n\nMoroccan literature is written mostly in Arabic, Berber, Hebrew, and French. Particularly under the Almoravid and Almohad empires, Moroccan literature was closely related to the literature of al-Andalus, and shared important poetic and literary forms such as zajal, the muwashshah, and the maqama. Islamic literature, such as Quranic exegeses and other religious works such as Qadi Ayyad's Al-Shifa were influential. The University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fes was an important literary centre attracting scholars from abroad, including Maimonides, Ibn al-Khatib, and Ibn Khaldun.\n\n## Music\n\nMoroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins. Rock-influenced chaabi bands are widespread, as is trance music with historical origins in Islamic music.\n\n## Media\n\nCinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by Louis Lumière in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area. In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Centre was established.\n\n## Cuisine\n\nMoroccan cuisine is considered one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world. The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\n## Sport\n\nFootball is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular. In 1986, Morocco became the first Arab and African country to qualify for the second round of the FIFA World Cup. Morocco hosted the Africa Cup of Nations in 1988 and will host it again in 2025 after original host Guinea was stripped from hosting rights due to inadequacy of hosting preparations. Morocco was originally scheduled to host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, but refused to host the tournament on the scheduled dates because of fears over the Ebola outbreak on the continent. Morocco made six attempts to host the FIFA World Cup but lost five times to the United States, France, Germany, South Africa and a Canada–Mexico–United States joint bid, however Morocco will co-host it in 2030 along with Portugal and Spain having finally won the bid in their sixth attempt. In 2022, Morocco became the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals and finished 4th in the tournament.\n\nThe article is now complete.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

[205] and 35% of the population [209] [210] According to Encyclopædia Britannica, Morocco's population is composed of 44% Arabs, 24% Arabized Berbers, 21% Berbers, 10% Mauritanian Moors, and 1% others [211] Berbers are divided into three main groups with varying languages who live spread out in rural mountain areas, namely the Rifians in the Rif, the Zayanes in the Middle Atlas, and the Shilha people in the Anti-Atlas [205] Centuries of Arab migrations to the Maghreb from the Arabian Peninsula since the 7th century have significantly altered Morocco's demographic landscape, both culturally and genetically [212] A sizeable portion of the population is identified as Haratin and Gnawa (or Gnaoua), West African or mixed-race descendants of slaves, and Moriscos, European Muslims expelled from Spain and Portugal in the 17th century [213]\n\n\nReligion\nThe religious affiliation in the country was estimated by the Pew Forum in 2010 as 99% Muslim, with all remaining groups accounting for less than 1% of the population [214] Of those affiliated with Islam, virtually all are Sunni Muslims, with Shia Muslims accounting for less than 0.1% [215] However, nearly 15% of Moroccans nonetheless describe themselves as non religious according to a 2018 survey conducted by the research network Arab Barometer; the same survey saw nearly 100 percent of respondents identify as Muslims [216] Another 2021 Arab Barometer survey found that 67.8% of Moroccans identified as religious, 29.1% as somewhat religious, and 3.1% as non religious [217] The 2015 Gallup International poll reported that 93% of Moroccans considered themselves to be religious [218]\n\n\nLanguages\nMorocco's official languages are Arabic and Berber [8] [231] The country's distinctive group of Moroccan Arabic dialects is referred to as Darija Approximately 89.8% of the whole population can communicate to some degree in Moroccan Arabic [232] The Berber language is spoken in three dialects (Tarifit, Tashelhit and Central Atlas Tamazight) [233] In 2008, Frédéric Deroche estimated that there were 12 million Berber speakers, making up about 40% of the population [234] The 2004 population census reported that 28.1% of the population spoke Berber [232]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Morocco is free and compulsory through primary school The estimated literacy rate for the country in 2012 was 72% [240] In September 2006, UNESCO awarded Morocco amongst other countries such as Cuba, Pakistan, India and Turkey the \"UNESCO 2006 Literacy Prize\" [241]\n\n\nHealth\nMany efforts are made by countries around the world to address health issues and eradicate disease, Morocco included Child health, maternal health, and diseases are all components of health and well-being Morocco is a developing country that has made many strides to improve these categories However, Morocco still has many health issues to improve on According to research published, in 2005 only 16% of citizens in Morocco had health insurance or coverage [247] In data from the World Bank, Morocco experiences high infant mortality rates at 20 deaths per 1,000 births (2017) [248] and high maternal mortality rates at 121 deaths per 100,000 births (2015) [249]\n\n\nCulture\nMorocco is a country with a rich culture and civilisation Through Moroccan history, it has hosted many people All of whom have affected the social structure of Morocco.\n\n\nArchitecture\nMoroccan architecture reflects Morocco's diverse geography and long history, marked by successive waves of settlers through both migration and military conquest This architectural heritage includes ancient Roman sites, historic Islamic architecture, local vernacular architecture, 20th-century French colonial architecture, and modern architecture.\n\n\nLiterature\nMoroccan literature is written mostly in Arabic, Berber, Hebrew, and French Particularly under the Almoravid and Almohad empires, Moroccan literature was closely related to the literature of al-Andalus, and shared important poetic and literary forms such as zajal, the muwashshah, and the maqama Islamic literature, such as Quranic exegeses and other religious works such as Qadi Ayyad's Al-Shifa were influential The University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fes was an important literary centre attracting scholars from abroad, including Maimonides, Ibn al-Khatib, and Ibn Khaldun.\n\n\nMusic\nMoroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins Rock-influenced chaabi bands are widespread, as is trance music with historical origins in Islamic music.\n\n\nMedia\nCinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of Le chevrier Marocain (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by Louis Lumière in 1897 Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the Ouarzazate area In 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Centre  [fr] (CCM), the nation's film regulatory agency, was established Studios were also opened in Rabat.\n\n\nCuisine\nMoroccan cuisine is considered one of the most diversified cuisines in the world This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world [277] The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\n\nSport\nFootball is the country's most popular sport, popular among the urban youth in particular In 1986, Morocco became the first Arab and African country to qualify for the second round of the FIFA World Cup Morocco hosted the Africa Cup of Nations in 1988 and will host it again in 2025 after original host Guinea was stripped from hosting rights due to inadequacy of hosting preparations Morocco was originally scheduled to host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, [280] but refused to host the tournament on the scheduled dates because of fears over the Ebola outbreak on the continent [281] Morocco made six attempts to host the FIFA World Cup but lost five times to the United States, France, Germany, South Africa and a Canada–Mexico–United States joint bid, however Morocco will co-host it in 2030 along with Portugal and Spain having finally won the bid in their sixth attempt In 2022, Morocco became the first African and Arab team to reach the semifinals and finished 4th in the tournament.\n\n\nSee

The film is directed by Eric Appel and stars Daniel Radcliffe as Yankovic.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the life of Alfred \"Al\" Yankovic, a young man with a passion for music and a desire to become a famous musician. Despite his father's disapproval, Al's mother secretly purchases an accordion for him, which becomes his instrument of choice. However, his father destroys the accordion when Al is caught at an illicit polka party, straining his relationship with his parents.\n\nAs Al grows older, he becomes a skilled musician and begins to gain recognition for his unique style of parodying popular songs. He eventually becomes a successful musician, known for his humorous and lighthearted takes on popular culture.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a number of notable cameos, including Conan O'Brien as Andy Warhol, Jorma Taccone as Pee-wee Herman, Nina West as Divine, Akiva Schaffer as Alice Cooper, and Demetri Martin as Tiny Tim. Patton Oswalt plays a heckler in the bar scene, while Michael McKean appears as the MC.\n\n**Production**\n\nIn 2010, Funny or Die released a fake trailer for a satirical biographical film titled Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, directed by Eric Appel and starring Aaron Paul as Yankovic. The trailer was intended to parody prior biographical films on musicians, such as Ray (2004) and Walk the Line (2005).\n\nHowever, the film was not made at the time, and it wasn't until 2022 that production on the actual film began. The film had a budget of around $8 million and was shot over eighteen days, with filming taking place in Los Angeles. The film was originally planned to be shot in Atlanta to take advantage of tax breaks, but Roku allowed the film to be shot in Los Angeles to enable the hiring of a number of celebrities for cameo appearances.\n\n**Casting**\n\nDaniel Radcliffe was cast as Yankovic after his appearance on The Graham Norton Show, during which he sang a rendition of Tom Lehrer's song \"The Elements\". Radcliffe felt that his performance was the reason for his casting, and he was already a fan of Yankovic's work. He was also looking to expand his repertoire, believing the part gave him more creative capabilities similar to his role in Swiss Army Man (2016).\n\n**Filming**\n\nFilming began on February 10, 2022, and concluded after sixteen days on March 4, in Pomona, California. The pool party scene was shot in Tarzana, California. Post-production was done while Yankovic was on The Unfortunate Return of the Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour in 2022, with Yankovic working remotely with Appel's team to finalize the film.\n\n**Cultural References**\n\nThe film draws inspiration from a number of cultural references, including a scene in the film Boogie Nights (1997) and the 1969 incident with The Doors frontman Jim Morrison during a concert in Miami. The end-credits scene includes a parody of Carrie (1976), in which Madonna comes to visit Al's grave, only to be grabbed at the wrist by a zombified arm.\n\n**Music**\n\nWeird: The Al Yankovic Story (Original Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album accompanying the film. The album includes an original song recorded by Yankovic for the film, \"Now You Know\", as well as several of his parodies featured in the film with new recorded versions. The soundtrack compositions were by Leo Birenberg and Zach Robinson.\n\n**Release**\n\nWeird: The Al Yankovic Story had its world premiere at the Royal Alexandra Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2022. The film was released on The Roku Channel on November 4, 2022. Yankovic requested that the film have a limited release in theaters to make it eligible for the 95th Academy Awards, but Roku declined, preferring for the film to be instead eligible for the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received generally favorable reviews from critics, with an approval rating of 84% on Rotten Tomatoes and a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic.

version of West Side Story Because Robbins had no previous film experience, Mirisch hired Robert Wise to co-direct and produce because of his \"experience in gritty subject matter\" and his ability to complete motion pictures under budget and ahead of schedule Robbins was to direct the musical sequences, and Wise would handle the story's dramatic elements [7] Robbins directed his portion of the film first, spending a great deal of time on retakes and on-set rehearsals as well as discussing setups with Wise [8] [9] Assistant director Robert Relyea recalled an unusual number of injuries endured by the dancers [10] After 45 days of shooting, the picture was 24 days behind schedule [11] With the film over budget, Wise dismissed Robbins [12] The remaining dance numbers were directed with the help of Robbins's assistants Recognizing Robbins's considerable creative contribution to the film, Wise agreed that Robbins should be given co-directing credit Robbins and Wise also kept in contact and discussed the production, with Wise's taking many of Robbins's suggestions about the editing of the film [13] The titles and end credits sequences were designed by Saul Bass with Elaine Makatura Bass Bass was credited as visual consultant for creating the opening sequence over the film's overture [14]\n\n\nCasting\nAlthough Robbins pushed for 29-year-old Carol Lawrence, the first Maria, to be cast in the same role in the film, after seeing her screen test the producers agreed she was too old to play the part A number of other cast members from the Broadway and West End productions were cast in the film Tony Mordente, who played A-Rab on stage, was cast as Action in the film, and George Chakiris, Riff in the London stage production, played Bernardo in the film Tucker Smith, who joined the Broadway production several months into its run, played Diesel, renamed Ice for the film David Winters, the first Baby John on stage, played A-Rab Eliot Feld, an ensemble member

he writes: \"Musicals are often edited in a radically formalist style, without having to observe the cutting conventions of ordinary dramatic movies The editing of West Side Story is very abstract The music...and the dance numbers...are edited together for maximum aesthetic impact, rather than to forward the story Nor are the shots linked by some principle of thematic association Rather, the shots are juxtaposed primarily for their lyrical and kinetic beauty, somewhat like a music video\" [26] In his retrospective review, Roger Ebert singled out the dances as extraordinary [27] Robbins participated in the editing of the musical numbers along with Stanford, Wise, and Walter Mirisch His notes to Stanford stress that the editing should reveal the characters' emotions even if that compromised the dancing [28] The quote from Giannetti above indicates that the notes didn't strongly affect the final cuts of the dance numbers.\n\n\nReception\nWest Side Story is regarded as one of

about \"West_Side_Story_(1961_film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn New York City in 1957, two teenage gangs compete for control on the Upper West Side The Jets, a group of whites led by Riff, brawl with the Sharks, Puerto Ricans led by Bernardo Lieutenant Schrank and Officer Krupke arrive and break it up The Jets challenge the Sharks to a rumble to be held after an upcoming dance.\n\n\nCast\nUncredited:\n\n\nMusical numbers\nAct I\n\n\nProduction\nExecutive producer Walter Mirisch enlisted the services of Jerome Robbins, who had directed and choreographed the stage version of West Side Story Because Robbins had no previous film experience, Mirisch hired Robert Wise to co-direct and produce because of his \"experience in gritty subject matter\" and his ability to complete motion pictures under budget and ahead of schedule Robbins was to direct the musical sequences, and Wise would handle the story's dramatic elements [7] Robbins directed his portion of the film first, spending a great deal of time on retakes and on-set rehearsals as well as discussing setups with Wise [8] [9] Assistant director Robert Relyea recalled an unusual number of injuries endured by the dancers [10] After 45 days of shooting, the picture was 24 days behind schedule [11] With the film over budget, Wise dismissed Robbins [12] The remaining dance numbers were directed with the help of Robbins's assistants Recognizing Robbins's considerable creative contribution to the film, Wise agreed that Robbins should be given co-directing credit Robbins and Wise also kept in contact and discussed the production, with Wise's taking many of Robbins's suggestions about the editing of the film [13] The titles and end credits sequences were designed by Saul Bass with Elaine Makatura Bass Bass was credited as visual consultant for creating the opening sequence over the film's overture [14]\n\n\nCasting\nAlthough Robbins pushed for 29-year-old Carol Lawrence, the first Maria, to be cast in the same role in the film, after seeing her screen test the producers agreed she was too old to play the part A number of other cast members from the Broadway and West End productions were cast in the film Tony Mordente, who played A-Rab on stage, was cast as Action in the film, and George Chakiris, Riff in the London stage production, played Bernardo in the film Tucker Smith, who joined the Broadway production several months into its run, played Diesel, renamed Ice for the film David Winters, the first Baby John on stage, played A-Rab Eliot Feld, an ensemble member and understudy for Baby John on Broadway, played Baby John Jay Norman, Juano on stage, appeared as Pepe Reprising their stage roles in the film were Carole D'Andrea as Velma, Tommy Abbott as Gee-Tar, and William Bramley as Officer Krupke.\n\n\nEditing\nThomas Stanford won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for his work on West Side Story [23] The film was listed as the 38th best-edited film of all time in a 2012 survey of members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild [24] The dance sequences in particular have been noted by critics [25] In Louis Giannetti's textbook Understanding Movies, he writes: \"Musicals are often edited in a radically formalist style, without having to observe the cutting conventions of ordinary dramatic movies The editing of West Side Story is very abstract The music...and the dance numbers...are edited together for maximum aesthetic impact, rather than to forward the story Nor are the shots linked by some principle of thematic association Rather, the shots are juxtaposed primarily for their lyrical and kinetic beauty, somewhat like a music video\" [26] In his retrospective review, Roger Ebert singled out the dances as extraordinary [27] Robbins participated in the editing of the musical numbers along with Stanford, Wise, and Walter Mirisch His notes to Stanford stress that the editing should reveal the characters' emotions even if that compromised the dancing [28] The quote from Giannetti above indicates that the notes didn't strongly affect the final cuts of the dance numbers.\n\n\nReception\nWest Side Story is regarded as one of the greatest musical films ever made [29] It holds a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10 The site's critical consensus states: \"Buoyed by Robert Wise's dazzling direction, Leonard Bernstein's score, and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics, West Side Story remains perhaps the most iconic of all the Shakespeare adaptations to visit the big screen\" [30] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [31]\n\n\nCritical response\nWest Side Story is regarded as

{"title": "Shohei_Ohtani", "content": "\nEarly life\nOhtani was born to Kayoko and Toru Ohtani in Mizusawa (now part of Ōshū), Iwate, Japan, on July 5, 1994 His mother Kayoko was a national-level badminton player in high school and his father Tōru (徹) worked at a local automobile manufacturing plant and was an amateur baseball player who played in the Japanese Industrial League [12] [13]\n\n\nAmateur career\nAs a teenager, Ohtani could have played baseball for any powerhouse high school team in big cities such as Osaka or Yokohama [13] Instead, he opted to stay local, selecting Hanamaki Higashi High School in Iwate Prefecture, Northern Japan, [15] the same high school as pitcher Yusei Kikuchi, whom he admired; [16] Ohtani competed there as a swimmer [17] and played baseball [12] Ohtani's high school baseball coach, Hiroshi Sasaki, said that he was a fast swimmer who could have competed in the Olympics [18]\n\n\nProfessional career\nOhtani expressed a desire to move directly to the major leagues after high school and received interest from numerous teams including the Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers [20] [22] On October 21, 2012, he announced that he would pursue a career in Major League Baseball rather than turn professional in Japan [23] The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters decided to draft him in the 2012 NPB Draft nevertheless, despite knowing that there was a high likelihood he would not play for them After an exclusive negotiating window between him and the Fighters, Ohtani announced that he would sign with the Fighters and spend some years in Japan before a possible MLB move [14] [24] Hokkaido said it would allow Ohtani to serve as a pitcher and position player; the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had become Ohtani's top-choice MLB team, were not prepared to let him play both ways [25] He was assigned the jersey number 11, previously worn by Yu Darvish [26]\n\n\nHokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (2013–2017)\nOhtani made his debut at age 18 in the Fighters' season-opening game on March 29, 2013, playing as a right fielder [27] He was selected for a Pacific League roster spot for the 2013 All-star game As a pitcher, he finished the season with a 3–0 record in 11 starts As a rookie Ohtani was used in both the outfield (leading the Fighters with 51 games in right) and as a pitcher [28] He was the second Nippon Pro Baseball rookie drafted out of high school the previous year to be used as both a pitcher and position player, following Kikuo Tokunaga in 1951; Ohtani was the first to start in both roles He was the first NPB pitcher since Takao Kajimoto in 1963 to bat 3rd, 4th, or 5th and the first rookie hurler to do so since Junzo Sekine in 1950 He was the second player, following Osamu Takechi (also 1950), to start a game as a pitcher, bat in the heart of the order (3rd through 5th), and get a hit and a run batted in (RBI) in that game He missed time during the year with a right ankle sprain and right cheekbone fracture.\n\n\n2013: Rookie season\nOhtani made his debut at age 18 in the Fighters' season-opening game on March 29, 2013, playing as a right fielder [27] He was selected for a Pacific League roster spot for the 2013 All-star game As a pitcher, he finished the season with a 3–0 record in 11 starts As a rookie Ohtani was used in both the outfield (leading the Fighters with 51 games in right) and as a pitcher [28] He was the second Nippon Pro Baseball rookie drafted out of high school the previous year to be used as both a pitcher and position player, following Kikuo Tokunaga in 1951; Ohtani was the first to start in both roles He was the first NPB pitcher since Takao Kajimoto in 1963 to bat 3rd, 4th, or 5th and the first rookie hurler to do so since Junzo Sekine in 1950 He was the second player, following Osamu Takechi (also 1950), to start a game as a pitcher, bat in the heart of the order (3rd through 5th), and get a hit and a run batted in (RBI) in that game He missed time during the year with a right ankle sprain and right cheekbone fracture.\n\n\n2014: Second NPB All-Star selection\nThroughout the entire season, Ohtani performed double-duty as a pitcher and outfielder, utilizing his strong throwing arm as well as his impressive batting skills As a hitter, he batted .274, with 28 extra-base hits (including 10 home runs), 31 RBIs, and a .842 on-base plus slugging percentage in 212 at-bats As a pitcher, he was 11–4 with a 2.61 ERA in 24 starts and struck out 179 (third in NPB) in 155.1 innings His 10.4 K/9 was the best in the league and opponents hit just .223 against him.\n\n\n2015: Pacific League Pitcher Best Nine and ERA leader\n2015 marked Ohtani's third professional season (and second full season) Though his offensive production declined somewhat (five home runs), his performance on the mound was among the best in the league, earning him the starter role in the 2015 All-Star Game and the pitching spot in the end-of-year Pacific League Best Nine awards Ohtani started the 2015 NPB All-Star Game 1 for the PL He went two innings and struck out two, allowing one run (on a double by Yoshitomo Tsutsugo and a single by Jose Lopez), relieved by Nishi with a 1–0 deficit The PL would lose 8–6 but he got a no-decision He finished the season 15–5 with a 2.24 ERA, 196 strikeouts, and only 100 hits in 160+2⁄3 innings He led the PL in ERA (.14 over Nishi), tied Wakui for the most wins, and was second in strikeouts (19 behind Norimoto, though he threw 34 fewer innings) He rarely played the field but did see some action at DH, hitting .202/.252/.376 with five home runs in 109 at-bats He made the Best Nine as the PL's top hurler He finished third in MVP voting again, placing behind Yanagita and Shogo Akiyama for the 2015 Pacific League MVP Ohtani placed third in MVP voting (first among pitchers) and was one of three candidates considered for the 2015 Sawamura Award, given annually to the top pitcher in either league [38]\n\n\n2016: Pacific League MVP and Japan Series championship\nIn 104 games and 382 plate appearances in 2016, Ohtani hit 22 home runs He also hit 18 doubles, 67 RBI, batted .322 with an OBP of .416, scored 65 runs, and had seven stolen bases He won the Best Nine award as the designated hitter [42] Ohtani was the same dominant pitcher on the mound In 21 games pitched, he had a career-low ERA of 1.86 He had a 10–4 record, struck out 174 batters in 140 innings with 4 complete games and one shutout He also won the Best Nine award as a pitcher and won the Pacific League MVP He got nearly double as many votes as any other pitcher for the PL for the 2016 NPB All-Star Game; he had 300,025 while #2 Shota Takeda had 158,008 [43] He could not pitch in the event due to a blister on his finger but wound up starring as a designated hitter (DH) [44] In Game 1, he batted for DH Yuya Hasegawa and lined out in the 8th against Scott Mathieson Starting at DH and hitting 5th in Game 2, he homered off Shoichi Ino in the 5th to start the PL comeback from a 3–0 deficit He singled against Ryo Akiyoshi in the 7th and scored on a hit by Kenta Imamiya for a 4–3 lead Coming up with a 5–4 deficit in the 8th, he singled off Shinji Tajima to bring in Shogo Akiyama with the tying run He thus produced three of the PL's five runs in the 5–5 tie, earning him game MVP honors He hit 165 km/h (102.5 mph) on the radar gun during the year, setting a new NPB record [45] The record was broken by Thyago Vieira five years later, but he still holds the record for a Japanese player.\n\n\n2017: Final season in the NPB\nIn 2017, he played in 65 games, hitting .332 with eight homers and 31 RBIs while posting a 3–2 record, a 3.20 ERA, and 29 strikeouts as a pitcher [50] In September, it was revealed that Ohtani would ask to be posted at the end of the season to play in Major League Baseball in 2018 However, before that could happen, he had surgery on his right ankle in early October The injury had originally occurred in the 2016 Japan Series and had cost him a chance to play in the 2017 World Baseball Classic in addition to restricting his playing time during the season [51] [52] On November 21, 2017, MLB and NPB came to a posting agreement for Ohtani [53]\n\n\nLos Angeles Angels (2018–2023)\nOn December 9, 2017, Ohtani signed his deal with the Los Angeles Angels [55] On December 13, it was revealed that he had been diagnosed with a first-degree UCL sprain in his right elbow and received a platelet-rich plasma injection to treat the injury [56]\n\n\nInitial reception by American media\nOhtani's debut MLB spring training in 2018 was disastrous and the majority of American news sources were extremely disappointed, concluding that he could not accomplish even one of his two-way abilities [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Over two spring games against major leaguer batters, in just 2.2 innings pitching he gave up three home runs [57] and had a 27.0 earned run average [60] [61] (average ERA for MLB pitchers was 4.14 that year) He completed his five game spring training, three of which against minor leaguers, with an 11.7 ERA [60] in pitching, and 4 hits for 32 at bats, [62] [57] .125/.222/.125 in batting [63] [57] (batting average/on-base percentage/slugging percentage, averaged .248/.318/.409 for MLB batters that year) Several major newspapers suggested he needed plenty of Triple-A minor league appearances before starting for Angels [64] [65] [63] [66] By the end of Ohtani's impressive 2018 MLB regular season, the American media admitted they wrote off Ohtani far too early [57] [63]\n\n\n2018: AL Rookie of the Year\nBefore the start of the season, the Angels announced that they would use him as both a hitter and a pitcher [67] Ohtani started as the designated hitter on Opening Day, March 29, against the Oakland Athletics, singling in his first at-bat off of Kendall Graveman [68] On April 1, he made his pitching debut, striking out six batters in six innings while allowing three runs, to pick up his first MLB win [69] On April 3, Ohtani hit his first MLB home run, a 397-foot three-run homer against Josh Tomlin [70] On April 6, he hit his third home run in three days, becoming the first Angels rookie to do so [71] In only his second start on the mound on April 8, Ohtani took a perfect game through 6⅓ innings before allowing a hit Overall, Ohtani pitched seven scoreless innings while striking out 12 [72] On June 8, he was placed on the injured list for the first time in his MLB career due to a Grade 2 UCL sprain in his right elbow He received platelet-rich plasma and stem-cell injections to treat the injury [73]\n\n\n2019: Injury-shortened season\nOn May 7, 2019, Ohtani played in his first game with the Angels since undergoing Tommy John surgery, batting as a designated hitter against the Detroit Tigers [83] In a June 13 game against the Tampa Bay Rays, he became the first Japanese-born player to hit for the cycle in MLB history [84] On September 12, his season prematurely ended after it was revealed that he needed surgery to repair a bipartite patella He finished the season batting .286/.343/.505 with 18 home runs, 62 RBIs, and 12 stolen bases in 106 games [85]\n\n\n2020: Continued injury struggles\nThe 2020 MLB season did not start until July 24 due to the COVID-19 pandemic [86] On July 24, Ohtani was the first ever automatic player on second base in an official MLB game at the start of the 10th inning as part of one of the new 2020 MLB season rules in a game against the Oakland Athletics He was thrown out in a rundown [87] On July 26, Ohtani returned to the mound against the Oakland Athletics, making his first pitching appearance since September 2018 He allowed five runs and was removed from the mound without recording an out, starting his season with a loss and an infinite ERA [88] After his second start he began to experience discomfort in his right arm, and it was eventually revealed that he had a flexor strain in his right elbow after undergoing an MRI [89] He was shut down from pitching for the rest of the season [90]\n\n\n2021: Unanimous American League MVP\nAfter the results of the 2019 and 2020 seasons, Ohtani spent the offseason overhauling himself [92] [93] He adjusted his diet, [92] [93] threw bullpen sessions earlier than usual and took batting practice against live pitching, an offseason first for him [92] [93] He also embraced data and technology to optimize his training and recovery and also tinkered with a changeup [92] Furthermore, in spring training, the Angels and Ohtani agreed to allow him to play without limitations or restrictions and drop the \"Ohtani Rules\", [94] a plan the Angels mirrored from Ohtani's schedule in Japan and had implemented since his 2018 rookie season that restricted his usage to a schedule of pitching once a week and hitting only three to four times between starts [93]\n\n\n2022: AL MVP finalist and two-way dominance\nOn March 22, 2022, Major League Baseball introduced a new rule that allows for a pitcher in the batting order to remain in the game as a designated hitter after they are pulled from the pitching mound, colloquially dubbed the \"Ohtani rule\" [129] The Angels named him as the Opening Day starting pitcher [130] and he pitched 4+2⁄3 innings against the Houston Astros, allowing one earned run and one walk while striking out nine [131] He became the first player in MLB history to start Opening Day as both the starting pitcher and the leadoff hitter [132]\n\n\n2023: Second Unanimous AL MVP\nFresh off being named the Most Valuable Player of the 2023 World Baseball Classic, Ohtani made his second straight Opening Day start for the Angels' while batting third in the lineup against the Athletics on March 30 [150] On May 10, he struck out Jeremy Peña of the Astros for his 502nd career pitching strikeout, passing Babe Ruth on the all-time strikeout list With the feat, he also set the record for most pitching strikeouts by a player with 100 home runs [151]\n\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers (2024–present)\nOn December 11, 2023, Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the largest contract in professional sports history [9] His wages were structured so that $68 million per season was deferred until after the deal's conclusion, to be paid out from 2034 to 2043 [178]\n\n\n2024: 50–50 club and first World Series championship\nBecause of his elbow injury and consequent surgery in September 2023, Ohtani and the Dodgers announced that he would not pitch in the 2024 season [179] Ohtani debuted with the Dodgers as the designated hitter on March 20 against the San Diego Padres in Seoul, as part of the MLB Seoul Series [180] He hit his first home run as a Dodger against the San Francisco Giants on April 3, six years to the day after his first Major League home run [181] [182] On April 21, Ohtani hit the 176th home run of his career, passing Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japanese player in MLB history, [183] and hit his 200th on July 13 [184]\n\n\nInternational career\nOhtani was selected to Japan's Under-18 National Team that eventually finished in sixth place at the 2012 U-18 Baseball World Cup in Seoul [210]\n\n\n2012 WBSC U-18 Baseball World Cup\nOhtani was selected to Japan's Under-18 National Team that eventually finished in sixth place at the 2012 U-18 Baseball World Cup in Seoul [210]\n\n\n2015 WBSC Premier12\nIn the inaugural WBSC Premier12 tournament, Ohtani earned a bronze medal with the Japanese national team He was the ace of Japan's pitching staff, which also featured Kenta Maeda As the number one starter, Ohtani made two pitching appearances for Samurai Japan, both against Japan's arch-rival South Korea, winning Game 1 of the opening round and getting a no-decision in the semifinals Ohtani was subsequently named to the 2015 World Baseball Softball Confederation All-World Team and was named the 2015 WBSC Baseball Player of the Year [211]\n\n\n2017 World Baseball Classic\nOhtani was on the 28-man roster for the Japan National Baseball Team of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but was forced to withdraw due to an ankle injury [212]\n\n\n2023 World Baseball Classic\nOhtani played for the Japan National Baseball Team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic [213] He was named the Pool B MVP for his hitting and pitching performances in the group stage of the tournament [214] He earned the save in the championship game after pitching the final inning of Japan's win over the US in the final, striking out his Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout with a 3-2 slider to seal Japan's WBC championship, and won the tournament's MVP award after batting .435/.606/.739 as a hitter and posting a 1.86 ERA and 11 strikeouts in 9 2⁄3 innings as a pitcher [215]\n\n\nAwards and achievements\nMLB\n\n\nHonours\nMLB\n\n\nMLB statistical achievements\nOhtani is a 6-foot-4-inch (1.93 m), 210-pound (95 kg) right-handed starting pitcher [222] With an overhand delivery, [223] he throws a four-seam fastball averaging 97 miles per hour (156 km/h) [222] topping out at 102.5 mph (165 km/h), [224] an 86–93-mile-per-hour (138–150 km/h) forkball/split-finger fastball [225] [226] with late diving action, [227] an occasional curveball, and a solid slider at 85–91 miles per hour (137–146 km/h) [228] He posted a walks per nine innings rate of 3.3 across his NPB career [229] Ohtani has been compared to Justin Verlander by some MLB scouts [230] because of his ability and affinity for throwing harder in high-leverage spots, as well as later in games [231] Whereas most pitchers throw only a little harder in big spots than they do in normal ones and most pitchers lose speed as the game goes on, Ohtani, like Verlander, is able to reserve power and staying power in order to conserve energy without throwing max effort on every offering [231]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nOhtani is a 6-foot-4-inch (1.93 m), 210-pound (95 kg) right-handed starting pitcher [222] With an overhand delivery, [223] he throws a four-seam fastball averaging 97 miles per hour (156 km/h) [222] topping out at 102.5 mph (165 km/h),

on, Ohtani, like Verlander, is able to reserve power and staying power in order to conserve energy without throwing max effort on every offering [231]\n\n\nPitching\nOhtani is a 6-foot-4-inch (1.93 m), 210-pound (95 kg) right-handed starting pitcher [222] With an overhand delivery, [223] he throws a four-seam fastball averaging 97 miles per hour (156 km/h) [222] topping out at 102.5 mph

frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore Police Department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun.\n\n\nCasting\nThe casting of the show has been praised for avoiding big-name stars and using character actors who appear natural in their roles [9] The looks of the cast as a whole have been described as defying TV expectations by presenting a true range of humanity on screen [10] Many of the cast are black, consistent with the demographics of Baltimore.\n\n\nCrew\nAlongside Simon, the show's creator, head writer, showrunner, and executive producer, much of the creative team behind The Wire were alumni of Homicide and Primetime Emmy Award-winning miniseries The Corner The Corner veteran, Robert F Colesberry, was executive producer for the first two seasons and directed the season 2 finale before dying from complications from heart surgery in 2004 He is credited by the rest of the creative team as having a large creative role as a producer, and Simon credits him for achieving the show's realistic visual feel [5] He also had a small recurring role as Detective Ray Cole [24] Colesberry's wife Karen L Thorson joined him on the production staff [19] A third producer on The Corner, Nina Kostroff Noble also stayed with the production staff for The Wire rounding out the initial four-person team [19] Following Colesberry's death, she became the show's second executive producer alongside Simon [25]\n\n\nEpisode structure\nEach episode begins with a cold open that seldom contains a dramatic juncture The screen then fades or cuts to black while the intro music fades in The show's opening title sequence then plays; a series of shots, mainly close-ups, concerning the show's subject matter that changes from season to season, separated by fast cutting (a technique rarely used in the show itself) The opening credits are superimposed on the sequence, and consist only of actors' names without identifying which actors play which roles In addition, actors' faces are rarely seen in the title sequence.\n\n\nMusic\nRather than overlaying songs on the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot [36]\n\n\nStyle\nThe writers strove to create a realistic vision of an American city based on their own experiences [40] Simon, originally a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, spent a year researching a Baltimore homicide detective unit for his book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, where he met Burns Burns served in the Baltimore Police Department for 20 years and later became a teacher in an inner-city school The two of them spent a year researching the drug culture and poverty in Baltimore for their book The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood Their combined experiences were used in many storylines of The Wire.\n\n\nRealism\nThe writers strove to create a realistic

the drug culture and poverty in Baltimore for their book The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood Their combined experiences were used in many storylines of The Wire.\n\n\nVisual novel\nMany important events occur off-camera and there is no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one at the end of the pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it Salon has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows [27]\n\n\nSocial commentary\nSimon described the second season as \"a meditation on the death of work and the betrayal of the American working class .. it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered capitalism is not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact, raw capitalism is destined to serve the few at the expense of the many.\" [41] He added that season 3 \"reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals.\" The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, [41] which in Simon's view has failed in its aims [45] and has become a war against America's underclass [49] This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims [citation needed]\n\n\nThemes\nSimon has identified the organizations featured in the show—the Baltimore Police Department, City Hall, the Baltimore public school system, the Barksdale drug trafficking operation, The Baltimore Sun, and the stevedores' union—as comparable institutions All are dysfunctional in some way, and the characters are typically betrayed by the institutions that they accept in their lives [5] There is also a sentiment echoed by a detective in Narcotics—\"Shit rolls downhill\"—which describes how superiors, especially in the higher tiers of the Police Department in the series, will attempt to use subordinates as scapegoats for any major scandals Simon described the show as \"cynical about institutions\" [45] while taking a humanistic approach toward its characters [45]\nA central theme developed throughout the show is the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group's goals.\n\n\nInstitutional

developed throughout the show is the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group's goals.\n\n\nSurveillance\nCentral to the structure and plot of the show is the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire Salon described the title as a metaphor for the viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer [27] Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information [5]\n\n\nCast and characters\nThe Wire employs a broad ensemble cast, supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions featured on the show The majority of the cast is black, which accurately reflects the demographics of Baltimore.\n\n\nMain cast\nThe major characters of the first season were divided between those on the side of the law and those involved in drug-related crime The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo).\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes.\n\n\nSeason 1 (2002)\nThe first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes.\n\n\nSeason 2 (2003)\nThe second season, along with its ongoing examination of the drug problem and its effect on the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by dockworkers in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port [41] In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.\n\n\nSeason 3 (2004)\nIn the third season, the focus returns to the street and the Barksdale organization The scope is expanded to include the city's political scene A new subplot is introduced to explore the potential positive effects of de facto \"legalizing\" the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks—referred to as Hamsterdam The posited benefits, as in Amsterdam and other European cities, are reduced street crime city-wide and increased outreach of health and social services to vulnerable people These are continuations of stories hinted at earlier.\n\n\nSeason 4 (2006)\nThe fourth season concentrates on the school system and the mayoral race It takes a closer look at Marlo Stanfield's drug gang, which has grown to control most of western Baltimore's trafficking, and Dukie, Randy, Michael, and Namond – four boys from West Baltimore – as they enter the eighth grade Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.\n\n\nSeason 5 (2008)\nThe fifth and final season focuses on the media and media consumption [54] The show features a fictional depiction of the newspaper The Baltimore Sun, and in fact elements of the plot are ripped-from-the-headlines events (such as the Jayson Blair New York Times scandal) and people at the Sun [55] The season, according to David Simon, deals with \"what stories get told and what don't and why it is that things stay the same.\" [54] Issues such as the quest for profit, the decrease in the number of reporters, and the end of aspiration for news quality would all be addressed, alongside the theme of homelessness John Carroll of The Baltimore Sun was the model for the \"craven, prize hungry\" editor of the fictional newspaper [56]\n\n\nPrequel shorts\nDuring the fifth season, HBO produced three shorts depicting moments in the history of characters in The Wire The three prequels depict the first meeting between McNulty and Bunk; Proposition Joe as a slick business kid; and young Omar [57] The shorts are available on the complete series DVD set [58]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nAll seasons of The Wire have received positive reviews from major television critics, with seasons two through five in particular receiving near universal acclaim, with several naming it the best contemporary show and one of the best drama series of all time The first season received mainly positive reviews from critics, [69] [59] some even calling it superior to HBO's better-known \"flagship\" drama series such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under [70] [71] [72] On the review aggregator Metacritic, the first season scored 79 out of 100 based on 22 reviews [60] One reviewer pointed to the retread of some themes from HBO and David Simon's earlier works, but still found it valuable viewing and particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs [73] Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn-out plot, but was largely positive about the show's characters and intrigue [33]\n\n\nCritical response\nAll seasons of The Wire have received

when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore Police Department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun.\n\n\nCasting\nThe casting of the show has been praised for avoiding big-name stars and using character actors who appear natural in their roles [9] The looks of the cast as a whole have been described as defying TV expectations by presenting a true range of humanity on screen [10] Many of the cast are black, consistent with the demographics of Baltimore.\n\n\nCrew\nAlongside Simon, the show's creator, head writer, showrunner, and executive producer, much of the creative team behind The Wire were alumni of Homicide and Primetime Emmy Award-winning miniseries The Corner The Corner veteran, Robert F Colesberry, was executive producer for the first two seasons and directed the season 2 finale before dying from complications from heart surgery in 2004 He is credited by the rest of the creative team as having a large creative role as a producer, and Simon credits him for achieving the show's realistic visual feel [5] He also had a small recurring role as Detective Ray Cole [24] Colesberry's wife Karen L Thorson joined him on the production staff [19] A third producer on The Corner, Nina Kostroff Noble also stayed with the production staff for The Wire rounding out the initial four-person team [19] Following Colesberry's death, she became the show's second executive producer alongside Simon [25]\n\n\nEpisode structure\nEach episode begins with a cold open that seldom contains a dramatic juncture The screen then fades or cuts to black while the intro music fades in The show's opening title sequence then plays; a series of shots, mainly close-ups, concerning the show's subject matter that changes from season to season, separated by fast cutting (a technique rarely used in the show itself) The opening credits are superimposed on the sequence, and consist only of actors' names without identifying which actors play which roles In addition, actors' faces are rarely seen in the title sequence.\n\n\nMusic\nRather than overlaying songs on the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot [36]\n\n\nStyle\nThe writers strove to create a realistic vision of an American city based on their own experiences [40] Simon, originally a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, spent a year researching a Baltimore homicide detective unit for his book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, where he met Burns Burns served in the Baltimore Police Department for 20 years and later became a teacher in an inner-city school The two of them spent a year researching the drug culture and poverty in Baltimore for their book The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood Their combined experiences were used in many storylines of The Wire.\n\n\nRealism\nThe writers strove to create a realistic vision of an American city based on their own experiences [40] Simon,

Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood Their combined experiences were used in many storylines of The Wire.\n\n\nVisual novel\nMany important events occur off-camera and there is no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one at the end of the pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it Salon has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows [27]\n\n\nSocial commentary\nSimon described the second season as \"a meditation on the death of work and the betrayal of the American working class .. it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered capitalism is not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact, raw capitalism is destined to serve the few at the expense of the many.\" [41] He added that season 3 \"reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals.\" The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, [41] which in Simon's view has failed in its aims [45] and has become a war against America's underclass [49] This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims [citation needed]\n\n\nThemes\nSimon has identified the organizations featured in the show—the Baltimore Police Department, City Hall, the Baltimore public school system, the Barksdale drug trafficking operation, The Baltimore Sun, and the stevedores' union—as comparable institutions All are dysfunctional in some way, and the characters are typically betrayed by the institutions that they accept in their lives [5] There is also a sentiment echoed by a detective in Narcotics—\"Shit rolls downhill\"—which describes how superiors, especially in the higher tiers of the Police Department in the series, will attempt to use subordinates as scapegoats for any major scandals Simon described the show as \"cynical about institutions\" [45] while taking a humanistic approach toward its characters [45]\nA central theme developed throughout the show is the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group's goals.\n\n\nInstitutional dysfunction\nSimon has identified the

the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group's goals.\n\n\nSurveillance\nCentral to the structure and plot of the show is the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title The Wire Salon described the title as a metaphor for the viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer [27] Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information [5]\n\n\nCast and characters\nThe Wire employs a broad ensemble cast, supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions featured on the show The majority of the cast is black, which accurately reflects the demographics of Baltimore.\n\n\nMain cast\nThe major characters of the first season were divided between those on the side of the law and those involved in drug-related crime The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo).\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes.\n\n\nSeason 1 (2002)\nThe first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes.\n\n\nSeason 2 (2003)\nThe second season, along with its ongoing examination of the drug problem and its effect on the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by dockworkers in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port [41] In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.\n\n\nSeason 3 (2004)\nIn the third season, the focus returns to the street and the Barksdale organization The scope is expanded to include the city's political scene A new subplot is introduced to explore the potential positive effects of de facto \"legalizing\" the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks—referred to as Hamsterdam The posited benefits, as in Amsterdam and other European cities, are reduced street crime city-wide and increased outreach of health and social services to vulnerable people These are continuations of stories hinted at earlier.\n\n\nSeason 4 (2006)\nThe fourth season concentrates on the school system and the mayoral race It takes a closer look at Marlo Stanfield's drug gang, which has grown to control most of western Baltimore's trafficking, and Dukie, Randy, Michael, and Namond – four boys from West Baltimore – as they enter the eighth grade Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.\n\n\nSeason 5 (2008)\nThe fifth and final season focuses on the media and media consumption [54] The show features a fictional depiction of the newspaper The Baltimore Sun, and in fact elements of the plot are ripped-from-the-headlines events (such as the Jayson Blair New York Times scandal) and people at the Sun [55] The season, according to David Simon, deals with \"what stories get told and what don't and why it is that things stay the same.\" [54] Issues such as the quest for profit, the decrease in the number of reporters, and the end of aspiration for news quality would all be addressed, alongside the theme of homelessness John Carroll of The Baltimore Sun was the model for the \"craven, prize hungry\" editor of the fictional newspaper [56]\n\n\nPrequel shorts\nDuring the fifth season, HBO produced three shorts depicting moments in the history of characters in The Wire The three prequels depict the first meeting between McNulty and Bunk; Proposition Joe as a slick business kid; and young Omar [57] The shorts are available on the complete series DVD set [58]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nAll seasons of The Wire have received positive reviews from major television critics, with seasons two through five in particular receiving near universal acclaim, with several naming it the best contemporary show and one of the best drama series of all time The first season received mainly positive reviews from critics, [69] [59] some even calling it superior to HBO's better-known \"flagship\" drama series such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under [70] [71] [72] On the review aggregator Metacritic, the first season scored 79 out of 100 based on 22 reviews [60] One reviewer pointed to the retread of some themes from HBO and David Simon's earlier works, but still found it valuable viewing and particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs [73] Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn-out plot, but was largely positive about the show's characters and intrigue [33]\n\n\nCritical response\nAll seasons of The Wire have received positive reviews from major television critics,

The city has a rich history dating back to the 18th century and has played a significant role in the region's politics, economy, and culture. With a population of over 350,000 people, Alor Setar is a major commercial and industrial center in Kedah, known for its vibrant markets, cultural festivals, and historical landmarks.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Alor Setar\" is derived from the combination of two Malay words: \"Alor\" meaning \"small stream\" and \"Setar\" referring to the Bouea macrophylla Griff., a tree also known as the marian plum, gandaria, or plum mango.\n\nHistory\nAlor Setar was established on 31 December 1735 by Kedah's 19th Ruler, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II and was the state's eighth administrative centre since the establishment of the Kedah Sultanate in 1136. The earlier administrative centres were located in Kota Bukit Meriam, Kota Sungai Emas, Kota Siputeh, Kota Naga, Kota Sena, Kota Indera Kayangan, and Kota Bukit Pinang.\n\nOrigin\nAlor Setar was established on 31 December 1735 by Kedah's 19th Ruler, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II and was the state's eighth administrative centre since the establishment of the Kedah Sultanate in 1136. The earlier administrative centres were located in Kota Bukit Meriam, Kota Sungai Emas, Kota Siputeh, Kota Naga, Kota Sena, Kota Indera Kayangan, and Kota Bukit Pinang.\n\nPeriod of Turbulence\nA new administration institution was constructed in the settlement, with the sultan residing in Istana Kota Setar. However, the capital suffered a major attack when the Bugis armanda led by Raja Haji managed to destroy both the Istana Kota Setar (Royal Palace) and Balai Besar (Grand Hall) in 1770. In 1771, the British represented by Francis Light and Sultan Abdullah Mukaram Shah entered an agreement to halt the Bugis influence in Kedah.\n\nRecovery and Growth\nIn October 1883, James F Agustin, an Englishmen arrived in Kuala Sungai Kedah (now known as Kuala Kedah) about 10 km from the capital. He and a few other English explorers embarked their journey towards inland areas of Kedah, where he met several Malay settlements on the riverbanks of the Kedah river.\n\n19th and 20th Century\nOther significant events during the turn of the 20th century includes the reunification of Perlis and Setul (now Satun) to Kedah by the Siamese in May 1897 (both provinces had been separated from Kedah in 1821) held in Balai Besar.

{"title": "Gerald_Ford", "content": "\nEarly life\nFord was born Leslie Lynch King Jr on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents He was the only child of Dorothy Ayer Gardner and Leslie Lynch King Sr., a wool trader His paternal grandfather was banker and businessman Charles Henry King, and his maternal grandfather was Illinois politician and businessman Levi Addison Gardner Ford's parents separated just sixteen days after his birth and his mother took the infant Ford with her to Oak Park, Illinois, where her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law, Clarence Haskins James lived From there, she moved to the home of her parents in Grand Rapids, Michigan Gardner and King divorced in December 1913, and she gained full custody of her son Ford's paternal grandfather paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930 [9]\n\n\nCollege and law school\nFord attended the University of Michigan, where he played center and linebacker for the school's football team [17] and helped the Wolverines to two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933 In his senior year of 1934, the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota—the eventual national champion—to a scoreless tie in the first half After the game, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan said, \"When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them Ford and  [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out They were everywhere on defense.\" Ford later recalled, \"During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934 Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.\" His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, \"They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.\" [18]\n\n\nU.S. Naval Reserve\nFollowing the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Ford enlisted in the Navy [30] He received a commission as ensign in the U.S Naval Reserve on April 13, 1942 [31] On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at Annapolis, Maryland After one month of training, he went to Navy Preflight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he was one of 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill In addition, he coached all nine sports that were offered, but mostly swimming, boxing, and football During the year he was at the Preflight School, he was promoted to Lieutenant, Junior Grade, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943 [32]\n\n\nSea duty\nAfter Ford applied for sea duty, he was sent in May 1943 to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier USS Monterey (CVL-26), at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey From the ship's commissioning on June 17, 1943, until the end of December 1944, Ford served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey While he was on board, the carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944 In 1943, the carrier helped secure Makin Island in the Gilberts, and participated in carrier strikes against Kavieng, Papua New Guinea in 1943 During the spring of 1944, the Monterey supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, as well as in the Battle of the Philippine Sea [33] After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro [33]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1949–1973)\nAfter Ford returned to Grand Rapids in 1946, he became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to challenge Bartel J Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman Military service had changed his view of the world \"I came back a converted internationalist\", Ford wrote, \"and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist And I thought he ought to be replaced Nobody thought I could win I ended up winning two to one.\" [16]\n\n\nWarren Commission\nOn November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission, a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of President John F Kennedy [52] Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald He and Earl Warren also interviewed Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer According to a 1963 FBI memo that was released to the public in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities [53] [54] [55] In the preface to his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission, Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions [56]\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader (1965–1973)\nIn 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, secured another term as president and took 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new minority leader Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as minority leader [57] The members of the Republican caucus that encouraged and eventually endorsed Ford to run as the House minority leader were later known as the \"Young Turks\" One of the members of the Young Turks was congressman Donald H Rumsfeld from Illinois's 13th congressional district, who later on would serve in Ford's administration as the chief of staff and secretary of defense [58]\n\n\nVice presidency (1973–1974)\nFor the past decade, Ford had been unsuccessfully working to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber so that he could become House Speaker He promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976 [30] However, on October 10, 1973, Spiro Agnew resigned from the vice presidency [66] According to The New York Times, Nixon \"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\" The advice was unanimous House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later, \"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford.\" [37] Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the vice presidency would be \"a nice conclusion\" to his career [30] Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27 On December 6, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35 After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as vice president [24]\n\n\nPresidency (1974–1977)\nWhen Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency, taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House This made him the only person to become the nation's chief executive without being elected to the presidency or the vice presidency Immediately afterward, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech that was broadcast live to the nation, [67] [68] noting the peculiarity of his position [69] He later declared that \"our long national nightmare is over\" [70]\n\n\nSwearing-in\nWhen Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency, taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House This made him the only person to become the nation's chief executive without being elected to the presidency or the vice presidency Immediately afterward, he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech that was broadcast live to the nation, [67] [68] noting the peculiarity of his position [69] He later declared that \"our long national nightmare is over\" [70]\n\n\nNominating Rockefeller\nOn August 20, Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated [71] Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H W Bush Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him [72]\n\n\nPardon of Nixon\nOn September 8, 1974, Ford issued Proclamation 4311, which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president [73] [74] [75] In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation \"is a tragedy in which we all have played a part It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\" [76]\n\n\nDraft dodgers and deserters\nOn September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional amnesty program for military deserters and Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military [85] The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters [86] established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a presidential pardon and a change in military discharge status Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the Carter administration [87]\n\n\nAdministration\nWhen Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's Cabinet During his brief administration, he replaced all members except Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of the Treasury William E Simon Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the \"Halloween Massacre\" One of Ford's appointees, William Coleman—the Secretary of Transportation—was the second Black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after Robert C Weaver) and the first appointed in a Republican administration [88]\n\n\nMidterm elections\nThe 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place in the wake of the Watergate scandal and less than three months after Ford assumed office The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869) [91] Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body [92]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nThe economy was a great concern during the Ford administration One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board [93] In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to \"Whip Inflation Now\" As part of this program, he urged people to wear \"WIN\" buttons [94] At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment [93] To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending To try to mesh service and sacrifice, \"WIN\" called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption [95] On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the \"WIN\" campaign Over the next nine days, 101,240 Americans mailed in \"WIN\" pledges [93] In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems [96] The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion [97] At the time, inflation was over twelve percent [98]\n\n\nInflation\nThe economy was a great concern during the Ford administration One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board [93] In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to \"Whip Inflation Now\" As part of this program, he urged people to wear \"WIN\" buttons [94] At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment [93] To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending To try to mesh service and sacrifice, \"WIN\" called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption [95] On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the \"WIN\" campaign Over the next nine days, 101,240 Americans mailed in \"WIN\" pledges [93] In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems [96] The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion [97] At the time, inflation was over twelve percent [98]\n\n\nBudget\nThe federal budget ran a deficit every year Ford was president [99] Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which established special education throughout the United States Ford expressed \"strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children\" according to the official White House press release for the bill signing [100]\n\n\nSwine flu\nFord was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that \"swine flu\" was the cause Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be vaccinated [106] Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976 [107]\n\n\nEqual rights and abortion\nFord was an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, issuing Presidential Proclamation no 4383 in 1975:\n\n\nForeign policy\nFord continued the détente policy with both the Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War Still in place from the Nixon administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) [113] The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's own visit in December 1975 [114] The Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords [115] with the Soviet Union in 1975, creating the framework of the Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance which later evolved into Human Rights Watch [116]\n\n\nIndonesia and East Timor\nAs South Vietnam collapsed, an anti-communist Indonesia was seen as essential by the United States Good relations with the Indonesian government were considered more important than the decolonization process in East Timor [124] [125] The Ford administration gave the Suharto regime in Indonesia economic and military support, even as it invaded East Timor and committed a genocide that killed close to a third of the population [126] One day prior to the invasion, Ford and Kissinger met with Suharto, and they assured him that relations with Indonesia would remain strong regardless of Indonesia's actions and that it would not object to the annexation of East Timor [127]\n\n\nMiddle East\nIn the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises The Cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, fearing that it might impede negotiations in Cyprus, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until December 10, 1974, provided Turkey would not send American supplies to Cyprus [3] U.S military aid to Turkey was suspended on February 5, 1975 [3]\n\n\nVietnam\nOne of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing Vietnam War American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973 The accords declared a cease-fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S forces [133]\n\n\nMayaguez incident\nNorth Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S influence there The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters [139] The main crisis was the Mayaguez incident In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of Cambodia, Cambodians seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in international waters [140] Ford dispatched Marines to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the Mayaguez sailors were being released In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed [141] Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath [142] The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, D.C.\n\n\nAssassination attempts\nFord was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency In Sacramento, California, on September 5, 1975, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a Colt .45-caliber handgun at Ford and pulled the trigger at point-blank range [145] [146] As she did, Larry Buendorf, [147] a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun, and Fromme was taken into custody She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009, after serving 34 years [148]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nIn 1975, Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O Douglas Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, appointed by President Nixon [151] During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached [152] After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues [153] Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens \"He has served his nation well,\" Ford said of Stevens, \"with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.\" [154]\n\n\nSupreme Court\nIn 1975, Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O Douglas Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, appointed by President Nixon [151] During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached [152] After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the

without partisan political concerns.\" [154]\n\n\nOther judicial appointments\nFord appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 50 judges to the United States district courts [155]\n\n\n1976 presidential campaign\nFord reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S senator Bob Dole of Kansas [156]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1977–2006)\nThe Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing president, saying, \"For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.\" [164]\n\n\nHealth issues\nOn April 4, 1990, Ford was admitted to Eisenhower Medical Center for surgery to replace his left knee, orthopedic surgeon Robert Murphy saying, \"Ford's entire left knee was replaced with an artificial joint, including portions of the adjacent femur, or thigh bone, and tibia, or leg bone.\" [203]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nFord died on December 26, 2006, at his home in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves [210] At the time of his death, Ford was the longest-lived U.S president, having lived 93 years and 165 days (45 days longer than Ronald Reagan, whose record he surpassed) [30] He died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry S Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission [211]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSpeaking of his stepfather and his mother, Ford said, \"My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.\" [16]\n\n\nFamily\nSpeaking of his stepfather and his mother, Ford said, \"My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.\" [16]\n\n\nCivic and fraternal organizations\nFord was a member of several civic and fraternal organizations, including the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees), American Legion, AMVETS, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Sons of the Revolution, [219] Veterans of Foreign Wars, and was an alumnus of Delta Kappa Epsilon at Michigan.\n\n\nFreemasonry\nFord was initiated into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949 [220] He later said in 1975, \"When I took my obligation as a master mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States.\" [221] Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962 [222] In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977 [223] Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States [224]\n\n\nPublic image\nFord is the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president The choice of Ford to fill the vacant vice-presidency was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty [226] \"In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word\", said Martha Griffiths [227]\n\n\nHonors\nThe following are named after Ford:\n\n\nForeign honors\nThe following are named after Ford:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOfficial sites\n\n\nMedia coverage\n\n\nOther\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Gerald Ford**\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGerald Rudolph Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. on July 14, 1913, at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska. His parents, Dorothy Ayer Gardner and Leslie Lynch King Sr., were married for a short period before separating just 16 days after his birth. Ford's paternal grandfather, Charles Henry King, was a banker and businessman, while his maternal grandfather, Levi Addison Gardner, was a politician and businessman from Illinois. Ford's parents divorced in December 1913, and his mother took him to live with her sister and brother-in-law in Oak Park, Illinois, and later with her parents in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ford's paternal grandfather paid child support until his death in 1930.\n\n**College and Law School**\n\nFord attended the University of Michigan, where he played center and linebacker for the school's football team. He helped the Wolverines win two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. In his senior year of 1934, the team suffered a steep decline and won only one game, but Ford was still the team's star player. Ford later recalled, \"During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.\"\n\n**U.S. Naval Reserve**\n\nFollowing the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Ford enlisted in the Navy. He received a commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on April 13, 1942. Ford served as an instructor at the Navy Preflight School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. He also coached all nine sports offered at the school, mostly swimming, boxing, and football. During his time at the Preflight School, Ford was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant in March 1943.\n\n**Sea Duty**\n\nFord applied for sea duty and was sent to the pre-commissioning detachment for the new aircraft carrier USS Monterey (CVL-26) at New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey. He served as the assistant navigator, Athletic Officer, and antiaircraft battery officer on board the Monterey. The carrier participated in many actions in the Pacific Theater with the Third and Fifth Fleets in late 1943 and 1944. Ford was part of the crew that supported landings at Kwajalein and Eniwetok and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea.\n\n**U.S. House of Representatives (1949–1973)**\n\nAfter returning to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics. He was urged to challenge Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman, and eventually won the election. Ford's military service had changed his view of the world, and he became a converted internationalist. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1948 and served 13 terms.\n\n**Warren Commission**\n\nOn November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission, a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. He and Earl Warren interviewed Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer. Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions in his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission.\n\n**House Minority Leader (1965–1973)**\n\nFord was chosen to replace Charles Halleck as minority leader in 1965. The members of the Republican caucus that encouraged and eventually endorsed Ford to run as the House minority leader were known as the \"Young Turks.\" One of the members of the Young Turks was congressman Donald H. Rumsfeld, who later served in Ford's administration as the chief of staff and secretary of defense.\n\n**Vice Presidency (1973–1974)**\n\nOn October 10, 1973, Spiro Agnew resigned from the vice presidency. Ford was nominated to take his position and was confirmed by the Senate on November 27. He was sworn in as vice president on December 6, 1973.\n\n**Presidency (1974–1977)**\n\nWhen Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically assumed the presidency, becoming the first person to do so without being elected to the office. He was the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president. Ford's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the pardon of Richard Nixon, the introduction of a conditional amnesty program for military deserters and Vietnam War draft dodgers, and the signing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975.\n\n**Domestic Policy**\n\nThe economy was a great concern during the Ford administration. Ford created the Economic Policy Board and introduced the \"Whip Inflation Now\" campaign to try to control inflation. He also introduced a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nFord continued the détente policy with both the Soviet Union and China. He eased the tensions of the Cold War and reinforced the thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China. Ford signed the Helsinki Accords in 1975, creating the framework of the Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.\n\n**Judicial Appointments**\n\nFord appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O.

He died on December 26, 2006, at his home in Rancho Mirage, California.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nFord was married to Elizabeth Bloomer from 1948 until her death in 1997. He had four children, including Michael Ford, who was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2000.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nFord's presidency was marked by significant events, including the pardon of Richard Nixon and the introduction of a conditional amnesty program for military deserters and Vietnam War draft dodgers. He signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and continued the détente policy with both the Soviet Union and China. Ford's legacy is complex, reflecting both his efforts to heal the nation and his struggles with the economic and social challenges of the 1970s.\n\nFord is buried at the Gerald R.

In one of those games, Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota—the eventual national champion—to a scoreless tie in the first half After the game, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan said, \"When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had tears in my eyes I was so proud of them Ford and  [Cedric] Sweet played their hearts out They were everywhere on defense.\" Ford later recalled, \"During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934 Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds.\" His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, \"They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause.\" [18]\n\n\nU.S. Naval Reserve\nFollowing the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Ford enlisted in the Navy [30] He received a commission as ensign in

and participated in carrier strikes in the Marianas, Western Carolines, and northern New Guinea, as well as in the Battle of the Philippine Sea [33] After an overhaul, from September to November 1944, aircraft from the Monterey launched strikes against Wake Island, participated in strikes in the Philippines and Ryukyus, and supported the landings at Leyte and Mindoro [33]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1949–1973)\nAfter Ford returned to Grand Rapids in 1946, he became active in local Republican politics, and supporters urged him to challenge Bartel J Jonkman, the incumbent

dedicated isolationist And I thought he ought to be replaced Nobody thought I could win I ended up winning two to one.\" [16]\n\n\nWarren Commission\nOn November 29, 1963, President Lyndon B Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission, a special task force set up to investigate the assassination of President John F Kennedy [52] Ford was assigned to prepare a biography of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald He and Earl Warren also interviewed Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer According to a 1963 FBI memo that was released to the public in 2008, Ford was in contact with the FBI throughout his time on the Warren Commission and relayed information to the deputy director, Cartha DeLoach, about the panel's activities [53] [54] [55] In the preface to his book, A Presidential Legacy and The Warren Commission, Ford defended the work of the commission and reiterated his support of its conclusions [56]\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader (1965–1973)\nIn 1964, Lyndon Johnson led a landslide victory for his party, secured another term as president and took 36 seats from Republicans in the House of Representatives Following the election, members of the Republican caucus looked to select a new minority leader Three members approached Ford to see if he would be willing to serve; after consulting with his family, he agreed After a closely contested election, Ford was chosen to replace Charles Halleck of Indiana as minority leader [57] The members of the Republican caucus that encouraged and eventually endorsed Ford to run as the House minority leader were later known as the \"Young Turks\" One of the members of the Young Turks was congressman Donald H Rumsfeld from Illinois's 13th congressional district, who later on would serve in Ford's administration as the chief of staff and secretary of defense [58]\n\n\nVice presidency (1973–1974)\nFor the past decade, Ford had been unsuccessfully working to help Republicans across the country get a majority in the chamber so that he could become House Speaker He promised his wife that he would try again in 1974 then retire in 1976 [30] However, on October 10, 1973, Spiro Agnew resigned from the vice presidency [66] According to The New York Times, Nixon \"sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.\" The advice was unanimous House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later, \"We gave Nixon no choice but Ford.\" [37] Ford agreed to the nomination, telling his wife that the vice presidency would be \"a nice conclusion\" to his career [30] Ford was nominated to take Agnew's position on October 12, the first time the vice-presidential vacancy provision of the 25th Amendment had been implemented The United States Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford on November 27 On December 6, the House confirmed Ford by a vote of 387 to 35 After the confirmation vote in the House, Ford took the oath of office as vice president [24]\n\n\nPresidency (1974–1977)\nWhen Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, Ford automatically

audience in a speech that was broadcast live to the nation, [67] [68] noting the peculiarity of his position [69] He later declared that \"our long national nightmare is over\" [70]\n\n\nNominating Rockefeller\nOn August 20, Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated [71] Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H W Bush Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him [72]\n\n\nPardon of Nixon\nOn September 8, 1974, Ford issued Proclamation 4311, which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president [73] [74] [75] In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation \"is a tragedy in which we all have played a part It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\" [76]\n\n\nDraft dodgers and deserters\nOn September 16 (shortly after he pardoned Nixon), Ford issued Presidential Proclamation 4313, which introduced a conditional amnesty program for military deserters and Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada The conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the United States and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military [85] The program for the Return of Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Military Deserters [86] established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a presidential pardon and a change in military discharge status Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the Carter administration [87]\n\n\nAdministration\nWhen Ford assumed office, he inherited Nixon's Cabinet During his brief administration, he replaced all members except Secretary of State Kissinger and Secretary of the Treasury William E Simon Political commentators have referred to Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet in the fall of 1975 as the \"Halloween Massacre\" One of Ford's appointees, William Coleman—the Secretary of Transportation—was the second Black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after Robert C Weaver) and the first appointed in a Republican administration [88]\n\n\nMidterm elections\nThe 1974 Congressional midterm elections took place in the wake of the Watergate scandal and less than three months after Ford assumed office The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869) [91] Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body [92]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nThe economy was a great concern during the Ford administration One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board [93] In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to \"Whip Inflation Now\" As part of this program, he urged people to wear \"WIN\" buttons [94] At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment [93] To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending To try to mesh service and sacrifice, \"WIN\" called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption [95] On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the \"WIN\" campaign Over the next nine days, 101,240 Americans mailed in \"WIN\" pledges [93] In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems [96] The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion [97] At the time, inflation was over twelve percent [98]\n\n\nInflation\nThe economy was a great concern during the Ford administration One of the first acts the new president took to deal with the economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board [93] In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to \"Whip Inflation Now\" As part of this program, he urged people to wear \"WIN\" buttons [94] At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation

to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals This plan would also take $4.4 billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300 billion [97] At the time, inflation was over twelve percent [98]\n\n\nBudget\nThe federal budget ran a deficit every year Ford was president [99] Despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting, Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which established special education throughout the United States Ford expressed \"strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children\" according to the official White House press release for the bill signing [100]\n\n\nSwine flu\nFord was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that \"swine flu\" was the cause Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be vaccinated [106] Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976 [107]\n\n\nEqual rights and abortion\nFord was an outspoken supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, issuing Presidential Proclamation no 4383 in 1975:\n\n\nForeign policy\nFord continued the détente policy with both the Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War Still in place from the Nixon administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) [113] The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's own visit in December 1975 [114] The Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords [115] with the Soviet Union in 1975, creating the framework of the Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance which later evolved into Human Rights Watch [116]\n\n\nIndonesia and East Timor\nAs South Vietnam collapsed, an anti-communist Indonesia was seen as essential by the United States Good relations with the Indonesian government were considered more important than the decolonization process in East Timor [124] [125] The Ford administration gave the Suharto regime in Indonesia economic and military support, even as it invaded East Timor and committed a genocide that killed close to a third of the population [126] One day prior to the invasion, Ford and Kissinger met with Suharto, and they assured him that relations with Indonesia would remain strong regardless of Indonesia's actions and that it would not object to the annexation of East Timor [127]\n\n\nMiddle East\nIn the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, two ongoing international disputes developed into crises The Cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey Ford, concerned with both the effect of this on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, fearing that it might impede negotiations in Cyprus, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until December 10, 1974, provided Turkey would not send American supplies to Cyprus [3] U.S military aid to Turkey was suspended on February 5, 1975 [3]\n\n\nVietnam\nOne of Ford's greatest challenges was dealing with the continuing Vietnam War American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973 The accords declared a cease-fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S forces [133]\n\n\nMayaguez incident\nNorth Vietnam's victory over the South led to a considerable shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S influence there The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters [139] The main crisis was the Mayaguez incident In May 1975, shortly after the fall of Saigon and the Khmer Rouge conquest of Cambodia, Cambodians seized the American merchant ship Mayaguez in international waters [140] Ford dispatched Marines to rescue the crew, but the Marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as, unknown to the U.S., the Mayaguez sailors were being released In the operation, two military transport helicopters carrying the Marines for the assault operation were shot down, and 41 U.S servicemen were killed and 50 wounded, while approximately 60 Khmer Rouge soldiers were killed [141] Despite the American losses, the operation was seen as a success in the United States, and Ford enjoyed an 11-point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath [142] The Americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, D.C.\n\n\nAssassination attempts\nFord was the target of two assassination attempts during his presidency In Sacramento, California, on September 5, 1975, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a Colt .45-caliber handgun at Ford and pulled the trigger at point-blank range [145] [146] As she did, Larry Buendorf, [147] a Secret Service agent, grabbed the gun, and Fromme was taken into custody She was later convicted of attempted assassination of the President and was sentenced to life in prison; she was paroled on August 14, 2009, after serving 34 years [148]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nIn 1975, Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O Douglas Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, appointed by President Nixon [151] During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached [152] After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues [153] Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens \"He has served his nation well,\" Ford said of Stevens, \"with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.\" [154]\n\n\nSupreme Court\nIn 1975, Ford appointed John Paul Stevens as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to replace retiring Justice William O Douglas Stevens had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, appointed by President Nixon [151] During his tenure as House Republican leader, Ford had led efforts to have Douglas impeached [152] After being confirmed, Stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the Court's liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues [153] Nevertheless, in 2005 Ford praised Stevens \"He has served his nation well,\" Ford said of Stevens, \"with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns.\" [154]\n\n\nOther judicial appointments\nFord appointed 11 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 50 judges to the United States district courts [155]\n\n\n1976 presidential campaign\nFord reluctantly agreed to run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a challenge for the Republican party nomination Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S senator Bob Dole of Kansas [156]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1977–2006)\nThe Nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided Ford's successor, Jimmy Carter, opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing president, saying, \"For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.\" [164]\n\n\nHealth issues\nOn April 4, 1990, Ford was admitted to Eisenhower Medical Center for surgery to replace his left knee, orthopedic surgeon Robert Murphy saying, \"Ford's entire left knee was replaced with an artificial joint, including portions of the adjacent femur, or thigh bone, and tibia, or leg bone.\" [203]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nFord died on December 26, 2006, at his home in Rancho Mirage, California, of arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and diffuse arteriosclerosis He had end-stage coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis and insufficiency, caused by calcific alteration of one of his heart valves [210] At the time of his death, Ford was the longest-lived U.S president, having lived 93 years and 165 days (45 days longer than Ronald Reagan, whose record he surpassed) [30] He died on the 34th anniversary of President Harry S Truman's death; he was the last surviving member of the Warren Commission [211]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSpeaking of his stepfather and his mother, Ford said, \"My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.\" [16]\n\n\nFamily\nSpeaking of his stepfather and his mother, Ford said, \"My stepfather was a magnificent person and my mother equally wonderful So I couldn't have written a better prescription for a superb family upbringing.\" [16]\n\n\nCivic and fraternal organizations\nFord was a member of several civic and fraternal organizations, including the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees), American Legion, AMVETS, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Sons of the Revolution, [219] Veterans of Foreign Wars, and was an alumnus of Delta Kappa Epsilon at Michigan.\n\n\nFreemasonry\nFord was initiated into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949 [220] He later said in 1975, \"When I took my obligation as a master mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value my own father attached to that order But I had no idea that I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States.\" [221] Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962 [222] In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977 [223] Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States [224]\n\n\nPublic image\nFord is the only person to hold the presidential office without being elected as either president or vice president The choice of Ford to fill the vacant vice-presidency was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty [226] \"In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false He never attempted to shade a statement, and I never heard him utter an unkind word\", said Martha Griffiths [227]\n\n\nHonors\nThe following are named after Ford:\n\n\nForeign honors\nThe following are named after Ford:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nOfficial sites\n\n\nMedia coverage\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

as late as 1618, he reared a pair of Sarus cranes, which are considered in Indian culture to be love birds named Layla and Majnun Koch observed their breeding and wrote about them with keen interest [13] According to art historian Ram Nath the Salim Anarkali love legend can not be entirely fabricated myth since nobody would have had the courage to inscribe his name in public as a Majnun (passionate lover) without his approval [14] Nath says, Jahangir held his father Akbar in very high regard in his autobiography, still in 1599 he rebelled against Akbar and one most possible reason could be that his romance with Anarkali was frustrated by Akbar [14]\n\n\nProminent guesses about who the Anarkali was\nAccording to Haroon Khalid, irrespective of incestuous relationship in popular imagination, it is very unlikely that an emperor's concubine would have fallen in love with his rebellious son [3] Khalid says that the pomegranate garden is mentioned by Dara Shikoh, the grandson of Jahangir, in his work \"Sakinat al-Auliya\" as a location where the saint Mian Mir used to sit [3] According to Subhash Parihar, Dara also mentions the existence of a tomb in the garden but does not give it a name [15] According to Muhammed Baqir, the author of \"Lahore Past and Present\", Anarkali was originally just the name of the garden in which the tomb of Sahib-i-Jamal, one of the wife of Jahangir, was situated The tomb later came to be named as that of Anarkali [3]\n\n\nJust a pomegranate  garden\nAccording to Haroon Khalid, irrespective of incestuous relationship in popular imagination, it is very unlikely that an emperor's concubine would have fallen in love with his rebellious son [3] Khalid says that the pomegranate garden is mentioned by Dara Shikoh, the grandson of Jahangir, in his work \"Sakinat al-Auliya\" as a location where the saint Mian Mir used to sit [3] According to Subhash Parihar, Dara also mentions the existence of a tomb in the garden but does not give it a name [15] According to Muhammed Baqir, the author of \"Lahore Past and Present\", Anarkali was originally just the name of the garden in which the tomb of Sahib-i-Jamal, one of the wife of Jahangir, was situated The tomb later came to be named as that of Anarkali [3]\n\n\nSahib-i Jamal\nAccording to Muhammed Baqir, the tomb of Anarkali belonged to a woman named Sahib-i Jamal, a wife of Salim, the mother of the prince's second son Sultan Parvez and a daughter of the noble Zain Khan Koka The daughter of Zain Khan was married to Salim on 18 June 1596  [citation needed]\n\n\nSharf-un-Nissa\nAccording to Haroon Khalid, a chronicler named Noor Ahmad Chishti in his Tehqiqat–i–Chishti first published in 1849 notes Anarkali or Sharf–un–Nissa as Emperor Akbar's favorite concubine According to Tehqiqat–i–Chishti Anarkali died while Akbar was on his Deccan campaign Khalid says that while Chishti's book does not speak about a love affair with Salim, it was around the same time that Salim rebelled against his father Khalid says one possibility might also be that Akbar had the mausoleum built after his return from Deccan campaign [3]\n\n\nPrince Daniyal's mother\nBasing his analysis on the above two accounts, Abraham Eraly, the author of The Last Spring: The Lives and Times of the Great Mughals, wrote there \"seems to have been an oedipal conflict between Akbar and Salim\" He also considers it probable that Anarkali was the mother of Prince Daniyal Mirza [18]\n\n\nNur Jahan\nNur Jahan's first husband Sher Afghan died in a skirmish with Jahangir's foster brother Qutbuddin Koka in 1607 Jahangir fell in love with Nur Jahan and married her on 25 May 1611 [19] [20] According to Masudul Hasan and also Lisa Balabanlilar, a popular legend exists that Jahangir saw Nur Jahan in childhood and was attracted to her but Akbar had not given him permission to marry her; when Jahangir ascended the throne he got her husband killed and married her [19] Art historian Ram Nath gives credence to this theory saying for unknown reasons Nur Jahan's first marriage to Sher Afghan took place in 1599 when she was almost 22, quite late for a woman of that time [citation needed] Nath says it is quite possible that Jahangir might have seen her, and shown interest but his father Akbar denied permission taking political considerations into account    [21] Nath says that while modern biographers like Beniprasad do not put faith in this legend, there are contemporary mentions of the legend Nath points out that De Laet mentioned that a contemporary traveler Pelsaert said that Jahangir loved Nur Jahan even before her marriage to Sher Afghan but Akbar intervened otherwise [21] According to Nath, it is not impossible for Jahangir to have engineered the murder of Nur Jahan's first husband (1607) and suppressed the real cause of the conflict of his love interest [21]\n\n\nOpinion of historian Ram Nath\n\nArt historian R Nath said Jahangir had no wife on record bearing the name or title Anarkali, to whom the emperor could have built a tomb and dedicated a couplet with a suffix Majnun [25] He writes: \n\nPersonalities and timeline\nReign: 3 November 1605 – 28 October 1627\n\n\nFictional portrayals\nAnarkali has been the subject of a number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani books, plays and films The earliest, most-celebrated historical play about her, Anarkali, was written by Imtiaz Ali Taj in Urdu and performed in 1922 The play was made into a film Loves of a Mughal Prince, which was released in India in 1928 and stars Taj as Akbar [29] Another Indian silent film about the tawaif, Anarkali, was released in 1928 by R.S Choudhury, who remade it in Hindi with the same title in 1935 Bina Rai portrayed Anarkali in Anarkali, a 1953 Indian film In 1955, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Anjali Devi starred in Anarkali Kunchacko directed Anarkali, an Indian Tamil-language film, in 1966 [30]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nBibliography non-fictional\n\n\nBibliography fiction and literature\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Anarkali\n\nAnarkali is a legendary figure associated with the Mughal Empire, who is said to have been the object of love for Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir. The story of Anarkali has been the subject of numerous accounts, legends, and adaptations in literature, art, and film. However, the historicity and authenticity of the legend have been debated among scholars and historians.\n\n**Historicity and Development**\n\nAnarkali was first mentioned in the journal of the English tourist and trader William Finch, who visited the Mughal Empire on 24 August 1608. Finch's account provides the earliest Western record of the legend, but it is brief and lacks detail. The story of Anarkali gained popularity in the 17th century, particularly in the accounts of British travelers, who wrote about the relationship between Salim and Anarkali.\n\n**Western Traveller Accounts**\n\nThe earliest Western accounts about the relationship between Salim and Anarkali were written by British travelers William Finch and Edward Terry. Finch reached Lahore in February 1611, 11 years after the supposed death of Anarkali, to sell indigo he had purchased at Bayana on behalf of the East India Company. His account, which was written in early 17th-century English, gives the following information: Anarkali was a beautiful and intelligent woman who was loved by Prince Salim, and their relationship was discovered by Akbar, who was outraged and ordered Anarkali to be sealed alive in a wall.\n\n**The Legends**\n\nAccording to Lisa Balabanlilar, the majority of legends present Anarkali as a part of Akbar's harem as a spouse, a concubine, or a servant. Thus, as per Muni Lal, Anarkali was a maidservant in the household of Salim's mother, Mariam-uz-Zamani. A common thread across the various accounts is that after realizing the likelihood of an amour between his son Salim and Anarkali, Akbar got incensed and ordered to ensepulchre Anarkali alive in a wall. This brutality enraged Salim and caused him to rebel against his father. Balabanlilar continues, however, that while captivating and widely believed, the legend cannot be verified and most likely does not reference a historical event.\n\n**Scholarly Claims and Discourse**\n\nThe gravestone in the tomb for Anarkali bears the inscription: \"On the 4th of the month of Ramzan, 1010 A.H. in the reign of the great king Jahangir, the majesty of the king of kings,

article in English about \"Anarkali\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistoricity and development\nAnarkali was first mentioned in the journal of the English tourist and trader William Finch, who visited the Mughal Empire on 24 August 1608 [6]\n\n\nWestern traveller accounts\nThe earliest Western accounts about the relationship between Salim and Anarkali were written by British travellers William Finch and Edward Terry Finch reached Lahore in February 1611, 11 years after the supposed death of Anarkali, to sell indigo he had purchased at Bayana on behalf of the East India Company His account, which was written in early 17th-century English, gives the following information [7]\n\n\nThe legends\nAccording to Lisa Balabanlilar, the majority of legends present Anarkali as a part of Akbar's harem as a spouse, a concubine or a servant [11] Thus, as per Muni Lal, Anarkali was a maidservant in the household of Salim's mother, Mariam-uz-Zamani [12] A common thread across the various accounts is that after realizing the likelihood of an amour between his son Salim and Anarkali, Akbar got incensed and ordered to ensepulchre Anarkali alive in a wall This brutality enraged Salim and caused him to rebel against his father Balabanlilar continues, however, that while captivating and widely believed, the legend cannot be verified and most likely does not reference a historical event [11]\n\n\nScholarly claims and discourse\nThe gravestone in the tomb for Anarkali bears the inscription: [13]\n\n\nInscription\nThe gravestone in the tomb for Anarkali bears the inscription: [13]\n\n\nJahangir as Majnun\nAccording to Ebba Koch, Jahangir perceived himself as a Majnun prince king, who is almost mad in his love for his beloved  Ebba Koch says that he had his name inscribed as Majnun on the Anarkali's sarcophagus and had pictorials of himself painted as Majnun king; as late as 1618, he reared a pair of Sarus cranes, which are considered in Indian culture to be love birds named Layla and Majnun Koch observed their breeding and wrote about them with keen interest [13] According to art historian Ram Nath the Salim Anarkali love legend can not be entirely fabricated myth since nobody would have had the courage to inscribe his name in public as a Majnun (passionate lover) without his approval [14] Nath says, Jahangir held his father Akbar in very high regard in his autobiography, still in 1599 he rebelled against Akbar and one most possible reason could be that his romance with Anarkali was frustrated by Akbar [14]\n\n\nProminent guesses about who the Anarkali was\nAccording to Haroon Khalid, irrespective of incestuous relationship in popular imagination, it is very unlikely that an emperor's concubine would have fallen in love with his rebellious son [3] Khalid says that the pomegranate garden is mentioned by Dara Shikoh, the grandson of Jahangir, in his work \"Sakinat al-Auliya\" as a location where the saint Mian Mir used to sit [3] According to Subhash Parihar, Dara also mentions the existence of a tomb in the garden but does not give it a name [15] According to Muhammed Baqir, the author of \"Lahore Past and Present\", Anarkali was originally just the name of the garden in which the tomb of Sahib-i-Jamal, one of the wife of Jahangir, was situated The tomb later came to be named as that of Anarkali [3]\n\n\nJust a pomegranate  garden\nAccording to Haroon Khalid, irrespective of incestuous relationship in popular imagination, it is very unlikely that an emperor's concubine would have fallen in love with his rebellious son [3] Khalid says that the pomegranate garden is mentioned by Dara Shikoh, the grandson of Jahangir, in his work \"Sakinat al-Auliya\" as a location where the saint Mian Mir used to sit [3] According to Subhash Parihar, Dara also mentions the existence of a tomb in the garden but does not give it a name [15] According to Muhammed Baqir, the author of \"Lahore Past and Present\", Anarkali was originally just the name of the garden in which the tomb of Sahib-i-Jamal, one of the wife of Jahangir, was situated The tomb later came to be named as that of Anarkali [3]\n\n\nSahib-i Jamal\nAccording to Muhammed Baqir, the tomb of Anarkali belonged to a woman named Sahib-i Jamal, a wife of Salim, the mother of the prince's second son Sultan Parvez and a daughter of the noble Zain Khan Koka The daughter of Zain Khan was married to Salim on 18 June 1596  [citation needed]\n\n\nSharf-un-Nissa\nAccording to Haroon Khalid, a chronicler named Noor Ahmad Chishti in his Tehqiqat–i–Chishti first published in 1849 notes Anarkali or Sharf–un–Nissa as Emperor Akbar's favorite concubine According to Tehqiqat–i–Chishti Anarkali died while Akbar was on his Deccan campaign Khalid says that while Chishti's book does not speak about a love affair with Salim, it was around the same time that Salim rebelled against his father Khalid says one possibility might also be that Akbar had the mausoleum built after his return from Deccan campaign [3]\n\n\nPrince Daniyal's mother\nBasing his analysis on the above two accounts, Abraham Eraly, the author of The Last Spring: The Lives and Times of the Great Mughals, wrote there \"seems to have been an oedipal conflict between Akbar and Salim\" He also considers it probable that Anarkali was the mother of Prince Daniyal Mirza [18]\n\n\nNur Jahan\nNur Jahan's first husband Sher Afghan died in a skirmish with Jahangir's foster brother Qutbuddin Koka in 1607 Jahangir fell in love with Nur Jahan and married her on 25 May 1611 [19] [20] According to Masudul Hasan and also Lisa Balabanlilar, a popular legend exists that Jahangir saw Nur Jahan in childhood and was attracted to her but Akbar had not given him permission to marry her; when Jahangir ascended the throne he got her husband killed and married her [19] Art historian Ram Nath gives credence to this theory saying for unknown reasons Nur Jahan's first marriage to Sher Afghan took place in 1599 when she was almost 22, quite late for a woman of that time [citation needed] Nath says it is quite possible that Jahangir might have seen her, and shown interest but his father Akbar denied permission taking political considerations into account    [21] Nath says that while modern biographers like Beniprasad do not put faith in this legend, there are contemporary mentions of the legend Nath points out that De Laet mentioned that a contemporary traveler Pelsaert said that Jahangir loved Nur Jahan even before her marriage to Sher Afghan but Akbar intervened otherwise [21] According to Nath, it is not impossible for Jahangir to have engineered the murder of Nur Jahan's first husband (1607) and suppressed the real cause of the conflict of his love interest [21]\n\n\nOpinion of historian Ram Nath\n\nArt historian R Nath said Jahangir had no wife on record bearing the name or title Anarkali, to whom the emperor could have built a tomb and dedicated a couplet with a suffix Majnun [25] He writes: \n\nPersonalities and timeline\nReign: 3 November 1605 – 28 October 1627\n\n\nFictional portrayals\nAnarkali has been the subject of a number of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani books, plays and films The earliest, most-celebrated historical play about her, Anarkali, was written by Imtiaz Ali Taj in Urdu and performed in 1922 The play was made into a film Loves of a Mughal Prince, which was released in India in 1928 and stars Taj as Akbar [29] Another Indian silent film about the tawaif, Anarkali, was released in 1928 by R.S Choudhury, who remade it in Hindi with the same title in 1935 Bina Rai portrayed Anarkali in Anarkali, a 1953 Indian film In 1955, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Anjali Devi starred in Anarkali Kunchacko directed Anarkali, an

{"title": "Maus", "content": "\nSynopsis\nMost of the book weaves in and out of two timelines In the frame tale of the narrative present, Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens in New York City in 1978–79 [1] [2] [3] The story Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s, and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945 [2] [4]\n\n\nPrimary characters\nArt Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman An aunt poisoned his parents' first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis, four years before Spiegelman's birth [41] He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951 [42] During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it [27]\n\n\nBackground\nArt Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman An aunt poisoned his parents' first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis, four years before Spiegelman's birth [41] He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951 [42] During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it [27]\n\n\nComics medium\nAmerican comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s, but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s  [55] [56] By the time Maus began serialization, the \"Big Two\" comics publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, dominated the industry with mostly superhero titles [57] The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund [58] The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression [59] Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium [60]\n\n\nPublication history\nThe first chapter of Maus appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of Raw [45] as a small insert; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991 Every chapter but the last appeared in Raw [62]\n\n\nInternational publication\nPenguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986 In support of the African National Congress's cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to \"compromise with fascism\" by allowing publication of his work in South Africa [74]\n\n\nThemes\nSpiegelman, like many of his critics, has expressed concern that \" [r]eality is too much for comics .. so much has to be left out or distorted\", admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate [85] He takes a postmodern approach; Maus \"feeds on itself\", telling the story of how the story was made It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make For example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal [86]\n\n\nPresentation\nSpiegelman, like many of his critics, has expressed concern that \" [r]eality is too much for comics .. so much has to be left out or distorted\", admitting that his presentation of the story may not be accurate [85] He takes a postmodern approach; Maus \"feeds on itself\", telling the story of how the story was made It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make For example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal [86]\n\n\nMemory\nTo Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is \"dominated by memories that are not his own\" [99]  His work is one not of memory but of postmemory, a term she coined after encountering Maus This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories—the memory of another's memory—until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right The children's proximity creates a \"deep personal connection\" with the memory, though separated from it by \"generational distance\" [100] In the field of psychology, this is called transgenerational trauma or generational trauma.\n\n\nGuilt\nSpiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to [103] The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses—the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus' success was built [104] He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son, and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way [105] [106] As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this \"separate universe\", and feels inadequate in portraying it [27] [107]\n\n\nRacism\nSpiegelman parodies the Nazis' vision of racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Françoise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a \"schwartser\" as he says When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, \"It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!\" [108] Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans [109]\n\n\nLanguage\nVladek spoke Yiddish and Polish He also learned English, German, and French while still in Poland His knowledge of languages helps him several times during the story, both before and during his imprisonment Vladek's recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is in English,  [113] which became his daily language when he moved to America [114] Vladek's English is fluent, but his phrasing is often non-native, showing the influence of Yiddish (and possibly also of Polish) For example, he asks Art, \"But, tell me, how is it by you? How is going the comics business?\" [115] Later, describing his internment, he tells Art, \" [E]very day we prayed ..

The book is a biographical account of Spiegelman's father, Vladek, and his experiences during the Holocaust. The novel is presented in a unique format, using a combination of text and images to tell the story.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe book weaves in and out of two timelines. In the frame tale of the narrative present, Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the Rego Park neighborhood of Queens in New York City in 1978–79. The story Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s, and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945.\n\n**Primary Characters**\n\nArt Spiegelman was born on February 15, 1948, in Sweden to Polish Jews and Holocaust survivors Vladek and Anja Spiegelman. An aunt poisoned his parents' first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis, four years before Spiegelman's birth. He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951. During his youth, his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it.\n\n**Background**\n\nSpiegelman was born to a family of Holocaust survivors. His father, Vladek, was a Polish Jew who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp. Vladek's experiences during the Holocaust had a profound impact on his life and his relationship with his son Art. Spiegelman's mother, Anja, was also a Holocaust survivor who struggled to come to terms with her past.\n\n**Comics Medium**\n\nAmerican comic books were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s, but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s. The underground comix movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund. The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe first chapter of Maus appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of Raw. A new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991. Every chapter but the last appeared in Raw.\n\n**International Publication**\n\nPenguin Books obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986. In support of the African National Congress's cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to \"compromise with fascism\" by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.\n\n**Themes**\n\nSpiegelman takes a postmodern approach; Maus \"feeds on itself,\" telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make. For example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.\n\n**Memory**\n\nTo Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is \"dominated by memories that are not his own.\" His work is one not of memory but of postmemory, a term she coined after encountering Maus. This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves.\n\n**Guilt**\n\nSpiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways. He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to. The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses—the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus' success was built.\n\n**Racism**\n\nSpiegelman parodies the Nazis' vision of racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Françoise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a \"schwartser\" as he says. When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, \"It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!\"\n\n**Language**\n\nVladek spoke Yiddish and Polish. He also learned English, German, and French while still in Poland. His knowledge of languages helps him several times during the story, both before and during his imprisonment. Vladek's recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is in English, which became his daily language when he moved to America.\n\n**Style**\n\nSpiegelman's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics. The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial, degrading Spiegelman's subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones.\n\n**Artwork**\n\nThe story is text-driven, with few wordless panels among its 1,500 black-and-white panels. The art has high contrast, with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins. There is little gray in the shading.\n\n**Influences**\n\nSpiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium's history. Chief among his early influences were Harvey Kurtzman, Will Eisner, and Bernard Krigstein's \"Master Race.\" Justin Green's Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary inspired Spiegelman to include autobiographical elements in his comics.\n\n**Reception and Legacy**\n\nSpiegelman's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected. Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and Maus became the center of new attention focused on comics.\n\n**Critique**\n\nA cottage industry of academic research has built up around Maus. Schools have also used it as course material in a range of fields, including literature, history, dysfunctional family psychology, language arts, and social studies. The volume of academic work published on Maus far surpasses that of any other work of comics.\n\n**Parody**\n\nBelgian publisher La Cinquième Couch produced a book entitled Katz, a remix of Spiegelman's book but with all animal heads replaced with cat heads.

Performance\n\nTextile performance refers to the ability of textile materials to withstand various conditions, environments, and hazards. The term \"serviceability\" refers to a textile product's ability to meet the needs of consumers. The emphasis is on knowing the target market and matching the needs of the target market to the product's serviceability.\n\n## Concepts of Serviceability in Textiles\n\nThe serviceability of textiles is structured around several concepts, including aesthetics, durability, comfort and safety, appearance retention, care, environmental impact, and cost.\n\n### Aesthetics\n\nAesthetics imply the appearance and attraction of textile products; it includes the color and texture of the material. Textile products with pleasing aesthetics can enhance the wearer's self-esteem and confidence.\n\n### Durability\n\nDurability in textiles refers to the product's capacity to endure use; the amount of time the product is regarded adequate for the intended application. Textile products with high durability can withstand wear and tear, extending their lifespan.\n\n### Comfort\n\nThe performance of textiles extends to functionality through comfort and protection. Comfort refers to a state of physical or psychological well-being, encompassing perceptions, physiological, social, and psychological requirements. Clothing provides comfort on various levels, including aesthetic, tactile, thermal, moisture, and pressure.\n\n### Protection\n\nProtection in textiles refers to a large application area where the performance (of functionality) is more central than aesthetic values. Protective clothing, such as bulletproof jackets, is designed to safeguard the wearer from harm.\n\n### Appearance Retention\n\nThe ability of a textile product to retain its appearance after being used, washed, and ironed is referred to as appearance retention. Textile products with high appearance retention can maintain their original appearance even after repeated use and washing.\n\n### Care\n\nThe treatment necessary to maintain the appearance of textile products is referred to as care. Textile products need to be cleaned and ironed to keep their look, including how to wash them and how to dry them. Care labeling for textile products takes into account the performance of each component as well as the manufacturing methods.\n\n### Cost\n\nThe cost of a textile product includes the raw material, manufacturing, and maintenance costs. Textile products with high cost can be a significant investment, but they often provide long-term benefits.\n\n### Environmental Impact\n\nEvery textile product has an impact on the environment. The extent to which textiles harm the environment during manufacturing, care, and disposal is a concept of textile serviceability. The substances that add performance to textiles have a severe impact on the environment and human health.\n\n## Properties\n\nThe performance of textile products is primarily based on fiber and fabric structure. Fiber properties are fundamentally determined by their physical and chemical properties. Specific finishing methods, functional finishes, fit, and product design can all be used to improve the overall performance of a textile product, allowing it to achieve higher performance levels.\n\n### Fiber Properties - Built-in (Natural) Properties\n\nNatural fibers, such as wool, possess inherent functional properties, including stretch, warmth, water absorption, flame retardance, and the ability to wick away body moisture. Merino wool also protects from harmful UV rays.\n\n### Added or Additional Properties\n\nAdditional properties are properties other than the inherent properties of the textiles that are specifically added in accordance with the specific needs. These properties can be added during different textile manufacturing steps from fiber to fabric.\n\n### High-Performance Fibers\n\nHigh-performance fibers are specifically synthesized to achieve unique properties, such as higher heat resistance, exceptional strength, high strength-to-weight ratio, stiffness, tensile strength, chemical or fire resistance. These high-performance fibers are used in protective clothing with exceptional characteristics like chemical resistance and fire resistance.\n\n## Finishing Methods\n\nFinishing improves appearance and performance. Textile finishing is the process of converting the loomstate or raw goods into a useful product, which can be done mechanically or chemically. Finishing is a broad term that refers to a variety of physical and chemical techniques and treatments that finish one stage of textile production while also preparing for the next.\n\n### Mechanical Finishing\n\nMechanical finishing purports machine finishes, such as embossing, heat setting, sanforizing, sheering, various luster imparting, surface finishes, and glaze finishes.\n\n### Functional Finishes or Special Purpose Finishes\n\nThe first modern waterproof raincoat was created following the patent by Scottish chemist Charles Macintosh in 1824 of new tarpaulin fabric, described by him as \"India rubber cloth.\" Application of performance finishes are not a new concept; oilcloth is the first known coated fabric.

[49] Specific finishing methods, functional finishes, fit, and product design could all be used to improve the overall performance of a textile product, allowing it to achieve higher performance levels [57] [58] [59]\n\n\nFiber properties—built in (natural) properties\nIn terms of performance, wool has been advertised as a \"miracle fabric\" [38] [64] [65] as it naturally possesses a variety of functional properties, including stretch, warmth, water absorption, flame retardance, and the ability to wick away body moisture [66] [67] Additionally, Merino wool has the ability to protect from harmful UV rays [68] [69] Natural and synthetic fibers have various properties that influence the final textile performance Most of the natural fibers are suited for comfort, where synthetics are better for aesthetics and durability.\n\n\nAdded or additional properties\nAdditional properties are properties other than the inherent properties of the textiles which are specifically added in accordance with the specific needs They may be added during different textile manufacturing steps from fiber to fabric.\n\n\nHigh-performance fibers\nHigh-performance fibers are specifically synthesized to achieve unique properties such as higher heat resistance, exceptional strength, high strength-to-weight ratio, stiffness, tensile strength, chemical or fire resistance [71] These high-performance fibers are used in protective clothing (PPE) with exceptional characteristics like chemical resistance and fire resistance [72]\n\n\nFinishing methods\nFinishing improves appearance and performance [79]\n\n\nFinish\nTextile finishing is the process of converting the loomstate or raw goods into a useful product, which can be done mechanically or chemically Finishing is a broad term that refers to a variety of physical and chemical techniques and treatments that finish one stage of textile production while also preparing for the next Textile finishing can include aspects like improving surface feel, aesthetical enhancement, and adding advanced chemical finishes [80] A finish is any process that transforms unfinished products into finished products [81] \nThis includes mechanical finishing and chemical applications which alter the composition of treated textiles (fiber, yarn or fabric.) Mechanical finish purports machine finishes such as embossing, heat setting, sanforizing, sheering, various, luster imparting, surface finishes, and glaze finishes [82] [83]\n\n\nFunctional finishes or special purpose finishes\nThe first modern waterproof raincoat was created following the patent by Scottish chemist Charles Macintosh in 1824 of new tarpaulin fabric, described by him as \"India rubber cloth,\" and made by sandwiching a rubber softened by naphtha between two pieces of fabric [93] [94] Application of performance finishes are not a new concept; Oilcloth is the first known coated fabric Boiling linseed oil is used to make oilcloth Boiling oils have been used from the year 200 AD [95] The \"special purpose finishes\" or ''Performance finishes'' are that improve the performance of textiles for a specific end-use [96] Performance finishing contributes to a variety of areas These finishes enable treated textiles with different characteristics, which may be opposite to their natural or inherent nature Functional finishes add value other than handfeel and aesthetics [4] [5] Certain finishes can alter the performance suiting for thermal comfort (thermal regulation), antimicrobial, UV protection, easy care (crease resistant cotton fabrics), and insect repellant etc [97]\n\n\nNanotechnology\nNanotechnology in textiles is a branch of nano-science in which molecular systems at the nano-scale of size (1–100 Nanometre) are applied in the field of textiles to improve performance or add functions to textiles Nanotechnology unites a variety of scientific fields, such as material science, physics, chemistry, biology and engineering For example: Nanocoating (of microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light) in textiles for biomimetics is the new method of structural coloration without dyes [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106]\n\n\nSurface tension biomimetics\nSurface tension biomimetics is a phenomenon of exploitation of biomimetics properties to create functional effects such as shark skin, and lotus leaf that have the ability to repel water and self-cleaning In textiles, surfaces with hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties are formed with the help of coatings and applied finishes [107] [108]\n\n\nSurface treatments\nCertain technologies can alter the surface characterizations of textiles.\n\n\nPlasma\nPlasma is a highly reactive state that activates the substrate, and the oxidized surface of the plasma-treated textile improves dyeing while reducing environmental impacts Plasma can also be used to treat textiles to obtain waterproofing and oil repellent properties Different gases in the same fiber may have other effects, and various gases are chosen for different results [109]\n\n\nLaser\nLight amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (laser) irradiation is used to modify the structural and surface properties of textiles, as well as to texturize them [109]\n\n\n3D textiles\n3D textiles are used in versatile applications, like military textiles, bulletproof jackets, protective clothing, manufacturing 3D composites, and medical textiles Examples include 3D spacer fabrics, which are used in treating a wound [110]\n\n\nTesting standards\nStandards vary with the use and application areas Military textiles, industrial textiles have separate tests to analyze performance in extreme conditions [111] [112] The American National Standards Institute approves the textile performance standards set by ASTM International [113] Other testing agencies or bodies which are recognized or accepted as international standards depending on the contracts: [50]\n\n\nSpecial test methods\nThe comfort performance of textiles is the foremost requirement that influences product acceptance Following comfort, safety and protection are the top priorities [114] Numerous tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of textiles.\n\n\nSweating guarded hot plate test\nThe test method evaluates the thermal resistance and water vapor permeability of fabrics, which bear on the garment's comfort [115] [116]\n\n\nBreathability test\nWater vapor transmission rate also called moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) is a method of testing or measuring the permeability for vapor barriers.\n\n\nAir permeability\nThe air permeability test method is for measuring the ability of air to pass through textile materials [120]\n\n\nMoisture management test\nThe moisture wicking or moisture management test is for testing moisture management properties such as wicking capabilities and drying efficiencies.\n\n\nQmax test\nThe Qmax test method is used to evaluate the surface warm-cool sensations of fabric and to indicate the instantaneous thermal feeling sensed when the fabric first comes into contact with the skin surface [122] [123]\n\n\nManikin test\nA thermal manikin is a device for analysing the thermal interface of the human body and its environment It assesses the thermal comfort and insulation properties of clothing, such as protective gear for the military [124] [125]\n\n\nKawabata evaluation system\nKawabata evaluation system measures the mechanical properties of the textiles such as  tensile strength,  shear strength, surface friction and roughness, The Kawabata evaluation system predicts human responses and understands the perception of softness Additionally, it can be used to determine the transient heat transfer properties associated with the sensation of coolness generated when fabrics come into contact with the skin while being worn [126] [127]\n\n\nPicture gallery\nClothing serves a variety of functions in our daily lives, from the home to occupational hazards The role of textiles in comfort, recreation, and safety The performance aspects of textiles through images.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Senegal", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe country of Senegal is named after the Senegal River The name of the river may derive from a Portuguese transliteration of the name of the Zenaga, also known as the Sanhaja [26] Alternatively, it could be a combination of the supreme deity in Serer religion (Rog Sene) and o gal meaning body of water in the Serer language French author and priest David Boilat put forward the theory that the name derives from the Wolof phrase \"sunuu gaal\", which means \"our canoe\" [27]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups Some kingdoms were created around the seventh century: Takrur in the sixth century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n\n\nEarly and pre-colonial eras\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups Some kingdoms were created around the seventh century: Takrur in the sixth century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n\n\nColonial era\nIn the mid-15th century, the Portuguese landed on the Senegal coastline, followed by traders representing other countries, including the French [35] Various European powers—Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain—competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward.\n\n\nIndependence\nIn January 1959, Senegal and the French Sudan merged to form the Mali Federation, which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960 Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August 1960 when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of Mali) each proclaimed independence.\n\n\n1980 to present\nIn 1980, Senghor decided to retire from politics The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, Abdou Diouf Former prime minister Mamadou Dia, who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 95.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSenegal is a republic with a presidency; the president is elected every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and seven years again from 2008 to 2016, by adult voters The first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the Académie française Senegal's second president, Abdou Diouf, later served as general secretary of the Organisation de la Francophonie The third president was Abdoulaye Wade, a lawyer The fourth president was Macky Sall, elected in March 2012 and reelected in February 2019 [55] On March 25, 2024, Bassirou Diomaye Faye became the fifth democratically elected president [56]\n\n\nPolitical culture\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president Marabouts, religious leaders of the various Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency In 2009, Freedom House downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive By 2014, it had recovered its Free status [57]\n\n\nLeadership in World governance initiatives\nSenegal has been one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution [65] [66] As a result, in 1968, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth [67] Léopold Sédar Senghor, then president of Senegal signed the agreement to convene a World Constituent Assembly [68]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSenegal is subdivided into 14 regions, [69] each administered by a Conseil Régional (Regional Council) elected by population weight at the Arrondissement level The country is further subdivided by 45 Départements, 113 Arrondissements (neither of which have administrative function) and by Collectivités Locales, which elect administrative officers [70]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSenegal has a high profile in many international organizations and was a member of the UN Security Council in 1988–89 and 2015–2016 It was elected to the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1997 Friendly to the West, especially to the United States, Senegal has vigorously advocated for more assistance from developed countries to the Third World The Foreign Minister of Senegal is Aïssata Tall Sall She took office in November 2020.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of Senegal consist of about 17,000 personnel in the army, air force, navy, and gendarmerie The Senegalese military receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States, and to a lesser extent Germany.\n\n\nLaw\nSenegal is a secular state, as defined in its Constitution [75]\n\n\nGeography\nSenegal is located on the west of the African continent It lies between latitudes 12° and 17°N, and longitudes 11° and 18°W.\n\n\nClimate\nSenegal has a tropical climate with pleasant heat throughout the year with well-defined dry and humid seasons that result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds The dry season (December to April) is dominated by hot, dry, harmattan wind [6]\nDakar's annual rainfall of about 600 mm (24 in) occurs between June and October when maximum temperatures average 30 °C (86.0 °F) and minimums 24.2 °C (75.6 °F); December to February maximum temperatures average 25.7 °C (78.3 °F) and minimums 18 °C (64.4 °F) [83]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe economy of Senegal is driven by mining, construction, tourism, fishing and agriculture, which are the main sources of employment in rural areas, despite abundant natural resources in iron, zircon, gas, gold, phosphates, and numerous oil discoveries recently Senegal's economy gains most of its foreign exchange from fish, phosphates, groundnuts, tourism, and services As one of the dominant parts of the economy, the agricultural sector of Senegal is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions, such as variations in rainfall and climate change, and changes in world commodity prices.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy of Senegal is driven by mining, construction, tourism, fishing and agriculture, which are the main sources of employment in rural areas, despite abundant natural resources in iron, zircon, gas, gold, phosphates, and numerous oil discoveries recently Senegal's economy gains most of its foreign exchange from fish, phosphates, groundnuts, tourism, and services As one of the dominant parts of the economy, the agricultural sector of Senegal is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions, such as variations in rainfall and climate change, and changes in world commodity prices.\n\n\nIndustry and trade\nThree trans-African automobile routes pass through Senegal:\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is one of the dominant parts of Senegal's economy, even though Senegal lies within the drought-prone Sahel region As only about 5% of the land is irrigated, [citation needed] Senegal continues to rely on rain-fed agriculture Agriculture occupies about 75% of the workforce Despite a relatively wide variety of agricultural production, the majority of farmers produce for subsistence needs Millet, rice, corn, and sorghum are the primary food crops grown in Senegal Production is subject to drought and threats of pests such as locusts, birds, fruit flies, and white flies [98] Moreover, the effects of climate change in Senegal are expected to severely harm the agricultural economy due to extreme weather such as drought, as well as increased temperatures [99]\n\n\nFishing\nSenegal has a 12-nautical-mile (22 km; 14 mi) exclusive fishing zone that has been regularly breached in recent years (as of 2014 [update]) It has been estimated that the country's fishermen lose 300,000 tonnes of fish each year to illegal fishing The Senegalese government have tried to control the illegal fishing which is conducted by fishing trawlers, some of which are registered in Russia, Mauritania, Belize and Ukraine In January 2014, a Russian trawler, Oleg Naydenov, was seized by Senegalese authorities close to the maritime border with Guinea-Bissau [100]\n\n\nEnergy\nAs of April 2020 [update], the energy sector in Senegal has an installed capacity of 1431 megawatts (MW) [101] Energy is produced by private operators and sold to the Senelec energy corporation According to a 2020 report by the International Energy Agency, Senegal had nearly 70% of the country connected to the national grid [102] Current government strategies for electrification include investments in off-grid solar and connection to the grid [101] [102]\n\n\nDemographics\nSenegal has a population of around 18 million, about 42 percent of whom live in rural areas Density in these areas varies from about 77 inhabitants per square kilometre (200/sq mi) in the west-central region to 2 per square kilometre (5.2/sq mi) in the arid eastern section.\n\n\nWomen\nSenegal ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the additional protocol Senegal is also a signatory of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, which was adopted during the 2003 African Union Summit However, feminists have been critical of the government's lack of action in enforcing the protocols, conventions and other texts that have been signed as a means of protecting women's rights [citation needed]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nSenegal has a wide variety of ethnic groups and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken According to \"CIA World Factbook:  Senegal\" (2019 estimates), the ethnic groups are Wolof (39%); Fula (probably including the Halpulaar speaking Toucouleur) (27.5%); Serer group (probably including the Serer Cangin peoples) (16%); Mandinka (4.9%); Jola (4.2%); Soninke (2.4%); other 5.4% (includes Europeans and persons of Lebanese descent), and other minor ethnic groups like the Bassari, Maures or (Naarkajors) [103]\n\n\nLanguages\nFrench is the official language, spoken by all those who have spent several years in the educational system, in which French is used as the medium of instruction (Koranic schools are also popular, but Arabic is less widely spoken outside of the context of recitation) Overall, speakers of French were estimated to make up 26% of the population in 2022 [106] During the 15th century, many European territories started to engage in trade in Senegal In the 19th century, France increased its colonial influence in Senegal and thus the number of French-speaking people multiplied continuously French was ratified as the official language of Senegal in 1960 when the country achieved independence.\n\n\nLargest cities\nDakar, the capital, is by far the largest city in Senegal, with over two million residents [111] The second most populous city is Touba, a de jure communaute rurale

"**Senegal**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSenegal is a country located in West Africa, bordered by The Gambia, Guinea, Mali, and Mauritania. With a population of approximately 18 million people, Senegal is a diverse country with a rich cultural heritage. The country has a long history, with various civilizations and empires rising and falling throughout the centuries. Senegal gained its independence from France in 1960 and has since been a republic with a president as head of state.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe country of Senegal is named after the Senegal River, which flows through the western part of the country. The name of the river may derive from a Portuguese transliteration of the name of the Zenaga, also known as the Sanhaja. Alternatively, it could be a combination of the supreme deity in Serer religion (Rog Sene) and o gal, meaning body of water in the Serer language. French author and priest David Boilat put forward the theory that the name derives from the Wolof phrase \"sunuu gaal\", which means \"our canoe\".\n\n**History**\n\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the seventh century: Takrur in the sixth century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n\n**Early and Pre-Colonial Eras**\n\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the seventh century: Takrur in the sixth century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n\n**Colonial Era**\n\nIn the mid-15th century, the Portuguese landed on the Senegal coastline, followed by traders representing other countries, including the French. Various European powers—Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain—competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward.\n\n**Independence**\n\nIn January 1959, Senegal and the French Sudan merged to form the Mali Federation, which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August 1960 when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of Mali) each proclaimed independence.\n\n**1980 to Present**\n\nIn 1980, Senghor decided to retire from politics. The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, Abdou Diouf. Former prime minister Mamadou Dia, who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 95.\n\n**Government and Politics**\n\nSenegal is a republic with a presidency; the president is elected every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and seven years again from 2008 to 2016, by adult voters. The first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the Académie française. Senegal's second president, Abdou Diouf, later served as general secretary of the Organisation de la Francophonie. The third president was Abdoulaye Wade, a lawyer. The fourth president was Macky Sall, elected in March 2012 and reelected in February 2019. On March 25, 2024, Bassirou Diomaye Faye became the fifth democratically elected president.\n\n**Political Culture**\n\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. Marabouts, religious leaders of the various Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, have also exercised a strong political influence in the country, especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, Freedom House downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive. By 2014, it had recovered its Free status.\n\n**Leadership in World Governance Initiatives**\n\nSenegal has been one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, in 1968, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth. Léopold Sédar Senghor, then president of Senegal, signed the agreement to convene a World Constituent Assembly.\n\n**Administrative Divisions**\n\nSenegal is subdivided into 14 regions, each administered by a Conseil Régional (Regional Council) elected by population weight at the Arrondissement level. The country is further subdivided by 45 Départements, 113 Arrondissements (neither of which have administrative function) and by Collectivités Locales, which elect administrative officers.\n\n**Foreign Relations**\n\nSenegal has a high profile in many international organizations and was a member of the UN Security Council in 1988–89 and 2015–2016. It was elected to the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1997. Friendly to the West, especially to the United States, Senegal has vigorously advocated for more assistance from developed countries to the Third World. The Foreign Minister of Senegal is Aïssata Tall Sall, who took office in November 2020.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Armed Forces of Senegal consist of about 17,000 personnel in the army, air force, navy, and gendarmerie. The Senegalese military receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States, and to a lesser extent Germany.\n\n**Law**\n\nSenegal is a secular state, as defined in its Constitution.\n\n**Geography**\n\nSenegal is located on the west of the African continent. It lies between latitudes 12° and 17°N, and longitudes 11° and 18°W.\n\n**Climate**\n\nSenegal has a tropical climate with pleasant heat throughout the year with well-defined dry and humid seasons that result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds. The dry season (December to April) is dominated by hot, dry, harmattan wind. Dakar's annual rainfall of about 600 mm (24 in) occurs between June and October when maximum temperatures average 30 °C (86.0 °F) and minimums 24.2 °C (75.6 °F); December to February maximum temperatures average 25.7 °C (78.3 °F) and minimums 18 °C (64.4 °F).\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nThe economy of Senegal is driven by mining, construction, tourism, fishing, and agriculture, which are the main sources of employment in rural areas, despite abundant natural resources in iron, zircon, gas, gold, phosphates, and numerous oil discoveries recently. Senegal's economy gains most of its foreign exchange from fish, phosphates, groundnuts, tourism, and services. As one of the dominant parts of the economy, the agricultural sector of Senegal is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions, such as variations in rainfall and climate change, and changes in world commodity prices.\n\n**Economy**\n\nThe economy of Senegal is driven by mining, construction, tourism, fishing, and agriculture, which are the main sources of employment in rural areas, despite abundant natural resources in iron, zircon, gas, gold, phosphates, and numerous oil discoveries recently.

As one of the dominant parts of the economy, the agricultural sector of Senegal is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions, such as variations in rainfall and climate change, and changes in world commodity prices.\n\n**Industry and Trade**\n\nThree trans-African automobile routes pass through Senegal.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nAgriculture is one of the dominant parts of Senegal's economy, even though Senegal lies within the drought-prone Sahel region. As only about 5% of the land is irrigated, Senegal continues to rely on rain-fed agriculture. Agriculture occupies about 75% of the workforce. Despite a relatively wide variety of agricultural production, the majority of farmers produce for subsistence needs. Millet, rice, corn, and sorghum are the primary food crops grown in Senegal. Production is subject to drought and threats of pests such as locusts, birds, fruit flies, and white flies. Moreover, the effects of climate change in Senegal are expected to severely harm the agricultural economy due to extreme weather such as drought, as well as increased temperatures.\n\n**Fishing**\n\nSenegal has a 12-nautical-mile (22 km; 14 mi) exclusive fishing zone that has been regularly breached in recent years. It has been estimated that the country's fishermen lose 300,000 tonnes of fish each year to illegal fishing. The Senegalese government have tried to control the illegal fishing which is conducted by fishing trawlers, some of which are registered in Russia, Mauritania, Belize, and Ukraine. In January 2014, a Russian trawler, Oleg Naydenov, was seized by Senegalese authorities close to the maritime border with Guinea-Bissau.\n\n**Energy**\n\nAs of April 2020, the energy sector in Senegal has an installed capacity of 1431 MW. Energy is produced by private operators and sold to the Senelec energy corporation. According to a 2020 report by the International Energy Agency, Senegal had nearly 70% of the country connected to the national grid. Current government strategies for electrification include investments in off-grid solar and connection to the grid.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nSenegal has a population of around 18 million, about 42% of whom live in rural areas. Density in these areas varies from about 77 inhabitants per square kilometre (200/sq mi) in the west-central region to 2 per square kilometre (5.2/sq mi) in the arid eastern section.\n\n**Women**\n\nSenegal ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the additional protocol. Senegal is also a signatory of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, which was adopted during the 2003 African Union Summit. However, feminists have been critical of the government's lack of action in enforcing the protocols, conventions, and other texts that have been signed as a means of protecting women's rights.\n\n**Ethnic Groups**\n\nSenegal has a wide variety of ethnic groups, and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken. According to the CIA World Factbook: Senegal (2019 estimates), the ethnic groups are Wolof (39%); Fula (probably including the Halpulaar speaking Toucouleur) (27.5%); Serer group (probably including the Serer Cangin peoples) (16%); Mandinka (4.9%); Jola (4.2%); Soninke (2.4%); other 5.4% (includes Europeans and persons of Lebanese descent), and other minor ethnic groups like the Bassari, Maures or (Naarkajors).\n\n**Languages**\n\nFrench is the official language, spoken by all those who have spent several years in the educational system, in which French is used as the medium of instruction (Koranic schools are also popular, but Arabic is less widely spoken outside of the context of recitation). Overall, speakers of French were estimated to make up 26% of the population in 2022. During the 15th century, many European territories started to engage in trade in Senegal. In the 19th century, France increased its colonial influence in Senegal, and thus the number of French-speaking people multiplied continuously. French was ratified as the official language of Senegal in 1960 when the country achieved independence.\n\n**Largest Cities**\n\nDakar, the capital, is by far the largest city in Senegal, with over two million residents. The second most populous city is Touba, a de jure communaute rurale (rural community), with over half a million people.\n\n**Religion**\n\nReligion in Senegal (2022, estimate) is predominantly Muslim (96.5%), with a small percentage of Christians (3.5%), and traditional animists.\n\n**Health**\n\nLife expectancy at birth was estimated to be 66.8 years in 2016 (64.7 years male, 68.7 years female). Public expenditure on health was at 2.4 percent of the GDP in 2004, whereas private expenditure was at 3.5 percent. Health expenditure was at US$72 (PPP) per capita in 2004. The fertility rate ranged 5 to 5.3 between 2005 and 2013, with 4.1 in urban areas and 6.3 in rural areas, as official survey (6.4 in 1986 and 5.7 in 1997) point out. There were six physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s (decade). Infant mortality in Senegal was 157 per 1,000 live births in 1950, but since then it has declined five-fold to 32 per 1,000 in 2018. In the past five years, infant mortality rates of malaria have dropped. According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 26% of women in Senegal have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\n**Education**\n\nArticles 21 and 22 of the Constitution adopted in January 2001 guarantee access to education for all children. Education is compulsory and free up to the age of 16. The Ministry of Labor has indicated that the public school system is unable to cope with the number of children that must enroll each year. Portuguese is taught at schools at the secondary high school level, given the large Cape Verdean community, and also from Guinea Bissau. There are sizeable Portuguese creole and standard Portuguese speaking communities in Zinguichor and Dakar.\n\n**Culture**\n\nSenegal is well known for the West African tradition of storytelling, which is done by griots, who have kept West African history alive for thousands of years through words and music. The griot profession is passed down generation to generation and requires years of training and apprenticeship in genealogy, history, and music. Griots give voice to generations of West African society.\n\n**Cuisine**\n\nBecause Senegal borders the Atlantic Ocean, fish is very important. Chicken, lamb, peas, eggs, and beef are also used in Senegalese cooking, but not pork, due to the nation's largely Muslim population. Peanuts, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as couscous, white rice, sweet potatoes, lentils, black-eyed peas, and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.\n\n**Music**\n\nSenegal is known across Africa for its musical roots, due to the popularity of mbalax, which originated from the Serer percussive tradition, especially the Njuup. It has been popularized by Youssou N'Dour, Omar Pene, and others. Sabar drumming is especially popular. The sabar is mostly used in special celebrations such as weddings. Another instrument, the tama, is used in more ethnic groups. Other popular international renowned Senegalese musicians are Ismael Lô, Cheikh Lô, Orchestra Baobab, Baaba Maal, Akon (US-born), Thione Seck, Viviane, Fallou Dieng, Titi, Seckou Keita, and Pape Diouf.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nHospitality, in theory, is given such importance in Senegalese culture that it is widely considered to be part of the national identity.

\"CIA World Factbook:  Senegal\" (2019 estimates), the ethnic groups are Wolof (39%); Fula (probably including the Halpulaar speaking Toucouleur) (27.5%); Serer group (probably including the Serer Cangin peoples) (16%); Mandinka (4.9%); Jola (4.2%); Soninke (2.4%); other 5.4% (includes Europeans and persons of Lebanese descent), and other minor ethnic groups like the Bassari, Maures or (Naarkajors) [103]\n\n\nLanguages\nFrench is the official language, spoken by all those who have spent several years in the educational system, in which French is used as the medium of instruction (Koranic schools are also popular, but Arabic is less widely spoken outside of the context of recitation) Overall, speakers of French were estimated to make up 26% of the population in 2022 [106] During the 15th century, many European territories started to engage in trade in Senegal In the 19th century, France increased its colonial influence in Senegal and thus the number of French-speaking people multiplied continuously French was ratified as the official language of Senegal in 1960 when the country achieved independence.\n\n\nLargest cities\nDakar, the capital, is by far the largest city in Senegal, with over two million residents [111] The second most populous city is Touba, a de jure communaute rurale (rural community), with over half a million people [111]\n\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Senegal (2022, estimate) [113]\n\n\nHealth\nLife expectancy at birth was estimated to be 66.8 years in 2016 (64.7 years male, 68.7 years female) [126] Public expenditure on health was at 2.4 percent of the GDP in 2004, whereas private expenditure was at 3.5 percent [127] Health expenditure was at US$72 (PPP) per capita in 2004 [127] The fertility rate ranged 5 to 5.3 between 2005 and 2013, with 4.1 in urban areas and 6.3 in rural areas, as official survey (6.4 in 1986 and 5.7 in 1997) point out [128] There were six physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s (decade) [127] Infant mortality in Senegal was 157 per 1,000 live births in 1950., but since then it has declined five-fold to 32 per 1,000 in 2018 [129] In the past five years infant mortality rates of malaria have dropped According to a 2013 UNICEF report, [130] 26% of women in Senegal have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\n\nEducation\nArticles 21 and 22 of the Constitution adopted in January 2001 guarantee access to education for all children [134] Education is compulsory and free up to the age of 16 [134] The Ministry of Labor has indicated that the public school system is unable to cope with the number of children that must enroll each year [134] Portuguese is taught at schools at the secondary high school level, given the large Cape Verdean community, and also from Guinea Bissau There are sizeable Portuguese creole and standard Portuguese speaking communities in Zinguichor and Dakar.\n\n\nCulture\nSenegal is well known for the West African tradition of storytelling, which is done by griots, who have kept West African history alive for thousands of years through words and music The griot profession is passed down generation to generation and requires years of training and apprenticeship in genealogy, history and music Griots give voice to generations of West African society [35]\n\n\nCuisine\nBecause Senegal borders the Atlantic Ocean, fish is very important Chicken, lamb, peas, eggs, and beef are also used in Senegalese cooking, but not pork, due to the nation's largely Muslim population Peanuts, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as couscous, white rice, sweet potatoes, lentils, black-eyed peas and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.\n\n\nMusic\nSenegal is known across Africa for its musical roots, due to the popularity of mbalax, which originated from the Serer percussive tradition especially the Njuup, it has been popularized by Youssou N'Dour, Omar Pene and others Sabar drumming is especially popular The sabar is mostly used in special celebrations such as weddings Another instrument, the tama, is used in more ethnic groups Other popular international renowned Senegalese musicians are Ismael Lô, Cheikh Lô, Orchestra Baobab, Baaba Maal, Akon (US-born), Thione Seck, Viviane, Fallou Dieng, Titi, Seckou Keita and Pape Diouf.\n\n\nCinema\nHospitality, in theory, is given such importance in Senegalese culture that it is widely considered to be part of the national identity The Wolof [137] word for hospitality is \"teranga\" and it is so identified with the pride of Senegal that the national football team is known as Les Lions de la Téranga [35] [original research?]\n\n\nMedia\nHospitality, in theory, is given such importance in Senegalese culture that it is widely considered to be part of the national identity The

about \"Decathlon\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistorical background\nThe decathlon developed from the ancient pentathlon competitions held at the ancient Greek Olympics Pentathlons involved five disciplines – long jump, discus throw, javelin throw, sprint and a wrestling match [3] Introduced in Olympia during 708 BC, this competition was extremely popular for many centuries.\n\n\nFormat\nThe vast majority of international and top-level men's decathlons are divided into a two-day competition, with the track and field events held in the order below Traditionally, all decathletes who finish the event, rather than just the winner or medal-winning athletes, do a round of honour together after the competition [citation needed] The current world record holder is Kevin Mayer from France with 9126 points which he set on September 16, 2018, in Talence, France.\n\n\nMen's decathlon\nThe vast majority of international and top-level men's decathlons are divided into a two-day competition, with the track and field events held in the order below Traditionally, all decathletes who finish the event, rather than just the winner or medal-winning athletes, do a round of honour together after the competition [citation needed] The current world record holder is Kevin Mayer from France with 9126 points which he set on September 16, 2018, in Talence, France.\n\n\nWomen's decathlon\nAt major championships, the women's equivalent of the decathlon is the seven-event heptathlon; before 1981 it was the five-event pentathlon [8] However, in 2001, the IAAF (now World Athletics) approved scoring tables for a women's decathlon; the current world record holder is Austra Skujytė of Lithuania, with 8,358 [9] Women's disciplines differ from men's in the same way as for standalone events: the shot, discus, and javelin weigh less, and the sprint hurdles use lower hurdles over 100 m rather than 110 m The points tables used are the same as for the heptathlon in the shared events In some women's decathlon competitions, the schedule differs from the men's decathlon, with the field events switched between day one and day two This rule was initially instituted to avoid scheduling conflicts when men's and women's decathlon competitions take place simultaneously, however by 2024 the rule was revised to allow conducting the women's decathlon using the men's event order [10] [11] The inaugural Women's Decathlon World Championships used the men's ordering of events [12]\n\n\nOne hour\nThe one-hour decathlon is a special type of decathlon in which the athletes have to start the last of ten events (1500 m) within sixty minutes of the start of the first event The world record holder is Czech decathlete Robert Změlík, who achieved 7,897 points at a meeting in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, in 1992 [13]\n\n\nMasters athletics\nIn Masters athletics, performance scores are age graded before being applied to the standard scoring table This way, marks that would be competitive within an age division can get rated, even if those marks would not appear on the scale designed for younger age groups Additionally, like women, the age divisions use different implement weights and lower hurdles Based on this system, German Rolf Geese in the M60 division and American Robert Hewitt in the M80 divisions have set their respective world records over 8,000 points Using the same scale, Nadine O'Connor scored 10,234 points in the W65 division, the highest decathlon score ever recorded [14] [15]\n\n\nPoints system\nThe 2001 IAAF points tables use the following formulae: [16]\n\n\nBenchmarks\nSplit evenly between the events, the following table shows the benchmark levels needed to earn 1,000, 900, 800, and 700 points in each sport.\n\n\nRecords\nThe official decathlon world record holder is Kevin Mayer of France, with a score of 9,126 points set during the 2018 Décastar in Talence, France, which was ratified by World Athletics.\n\n\nDecathlon bests\nThe total decathlon score for all world records in the respective events would be 12,636 The total decathlon score for all the best performances achieved during decathlons is 10,669 The Difference column shows the difference in points between the decathlon points that the individual current world record would be awarded and the points awarded to the current decathlon record for that event The relative differences in points are much higher in throwing events than in running and jumping events.\n\n\nAll-time top 25 men\nBelow is a list of other scores equal or superior to 8750 pts:\n\n\nNotes\nBelow

be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\n\n\nNominations\nMedia speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential election were released In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of the U.S Congress [5] Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates [6] Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore, the runner-up in the 2000 election; John Kerry, the runner-up in the 2004 election; John Edwards, Kerry's running mate in 2004; Delaware Senator Joe Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh [7]\n\n\nDemocratic

after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008 [6] In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain [49] The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies [6] Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place [50] Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively [51] [52] [53] [54] McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements [55] In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul [56] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007 [57]\n\n\nBefore the primaries\nImmediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008 [6] In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain [49] The media

Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007 [57]\n\n\nEarly primaries and caucuses\nEarly in the year, the support for Barack Obama started to increase in the polls and he passed Clinton for the top spot in Iowa; he ended up winning the caucus in that state, with Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third [11] Obama's win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the \"candidate of change\" [11] Iowa has since been viewed as the state that jump-started Obama's campaign and set him on track to win both the nomination and the presidency [12] After the Iowa caucus, Biden and Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest [11]\n\n\nSuper Tuesday\nMcCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [63] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates [64] Huckabee was the \"surprise performer\", winning 5 states and 218 delegates [64] Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates [64] Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would \"forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win\" [65] His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses Romney endorsed McCain on February 14 [66]\n\n\nOhio, Texas, and Pennsylvania\nOn March 4, Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a \"surprise upset\" by 10%, [25] [26] although she did lead in the polling averages in both states [21] [27] She also carried the primary in Texas, but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton [28]\n\n\nIndiana and North Carolina\nOn May 6, North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana [32] [33] In the actual results, Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states, winning by a significant margin in North Carolina [34] and losing by only 1.1% in Indiana (50.56% to 49.44%) [35] After these primaries, most pundits declared that it had become \"increasingly improbable,\" if not impossible, for Clinton to win the nomination [36] The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month [37] Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates, it was not enough to overcome Obama's substantial delegate lead.\n\n\nFlorida and Michigan\nDuring late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states' moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008 Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates [38]\n\n\nClinching the nomination\nThe major political party nomination process (technically) continues through June of an election year In previous cycles, the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the primaries held in March, but, in this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month campaign against Hillary Clinton He had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states Now, because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama [40] By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the Associated Press found that her numbers were \"accurate only\" in one close scenario [41]\n\n\nRepublican Party nomination\nNot only was the 2008 election the first time since 1952 that neither the incumbent president nor the incumbent vice president was a candidate in the general election, but it was also the first time since the 1928 election that neither sought his party's nomination for president; as Bush was term-limited from seeking another nomination, the unique aspect was Vice President Cheney's decision not to seek the Republican nomination [46] [47] The 2008 election was also the third presidential election since 1896 in which neither the incumbent president, the incumbent vice president, nor a current or former member of the incumbent president's Cabinet won the nomination of either major party the others being 1920 and 1952 [48] With no members of the Bush administration emerging as major contenders for the Republican nomination, the Republican race was as open as the Democratic race.\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\n\nWithdrawn candidates\nImmediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008 [6] In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain [49] The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies [6] Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place [50] Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively [51] [52] [53] [54] McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements [55] In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul [56] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007 [57]\n\n\nBefore the primaries\nImmediately after the 2006

early 2007 [57]\n\n\nEarly primaries/caucuses\nHuckabee, winner of Iowa, had little to no money and hoped for at least a third-place finish in New Hampshire McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire McCain staged a turnaround victory, [58] having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race [59]\n\n\nSuper Tuesday\nMcCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [63] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates [64] Huckabee was the \"surprise performer\", winning 5 states and 218 delegates [64] Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates [64] Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would \"forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win\" [65] His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses Romney endorsed McCain on February 14 [66]\n\n\nThird party and other nominations\nAlong with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election These were the Constitution Party, the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.\n\n\nCandidates gallery\nUntil the onset of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the unpopular Iraq War was a key issue during the campaign John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it (Obama's early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign) Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II, [75] his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President

be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.\n\n\nBush's unpopularity\nGeorge W Bush had become increasingly unpopular among Americans by late 2005 due in part by the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War domestically and internationally, as well as Bush's handling of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 By the time Obama was elected as President of the United States on November 4, 2008, Bush's approval rating was in the low to mid 20s and his disapproval grew increasingly significant, being in the high 60s, and even low 70s in some polls [76] Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent [77] [78] [79] In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, [80] but did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office [81]\n\n\nAge issue\nSimilar to Senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, one of the more widely leveled charges against McCain was the issue of his age—he turned 72 in August and there was widespread concern about the idea of electing a man who would be 80 years old if he completed two full terms in office (the oldest president, Ronald Reagan, had been a month shy of 78 when he left office in January 1989) [82] [83] In addition, McCain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in North Vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head His age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful Senator Obama, who was the first Generation Xer to run for president on a major party ticket [84] McCain for comparison was born before World War II and belonged to the Silent Generation [85] Much like Bob Dole, McCain attempted to counter these charges by releasing all of his medical records, something Obama did not do McCain's wife Cindy dismissed concerns about his health by arguing that \"We went hiking the Grand Canyon last summer and  [John] did great and had no trouble keeping up with us.\" McCain also appeared at several campaign stops with his still-active 95-year-old mother In a speech on the House floor, Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha criticized McCain's age by saying \"Seven presidents have come and gone since I've been in Congress, and I saw the toll the job took on each one of them.\" If elected, McCain would have been the first president born in the 1930s McCain ultimately died in 2018, [86] just one year after the completion of Obama's second term.\n\n\nEconomy\nPolls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters [95] [96] In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression [97] During this period, John McCain's election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.\n\n\nHealth care\nJohn McCain's proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a \"Guaranteed Access Plan\" [104]\n\n\nPresidential debates\nThe United States presidential election of 2008 was sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a bipartisan organization that sponsored four debates that occurred at various locations around the United States (U.S.) in September and October 2008 Three of the debates involved the presidential nominees, and one involved the vice-presidential nominees.\n\n\nCampaign costs\nThe reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004) [114] In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007 [115]\n\n\nExpense summary\nAccording to required campaign filings as reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 148 candidates for all parties collectively raised $1,644,712,232 and spent $1,601,104,696 for the primary and general campaigns combined through November 24, 2008 The amounts raised and spent by the major candidates, according to the same source, were as follows:\n\n\nNotable expressions and phrases\nElections analysts and political pundits issue probabilistic forecasts of the composition of the

media and Internet following Obama had over 2 million American supporters on Facebook and 100,000 followers on Twitter, while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter Obama's YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary [126]\n\n\nControversies\nAllegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states: Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina

9% for John McCain [141] Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain [142]\n\n\nTimeline\nElection Day was on November 4, 2008 The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting [151]

This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000 [162] Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of

Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton, though Obama was the first one ever to win the nomination of a major party, let alone the general election [187] The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history in which neither candidate was a white Protestant, as Biden is Roman Catholic and the first Roman Catholic to be elected vice president; all previous tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984) [188] The Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning ticket consisting of two sitting senators since 1960 (John F Kennedy/Lyndon B Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), and Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 Obama became the first Northern Democrat to win any state in the former Confederacy since Hubert Humphrey won Texas in 1968 This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major-party nominees was the incumbent president or vice-president.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nOpinion polling\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2008 United States presidential election was the 56th presidential election in United States history. The election was held on November 4, 2008, and was contested by two major parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2008 presidential election was a highly anticipated and closely watched event, marking a significant turning point in American politics. The election saw the election of Barack Obama, a young and charismatic African American politician, as the 44th President of the United States. Obama's victory marked a historic moment in American history, as he became the first African American to hold the office of President. The election also saw the election of Joe Biden as Vice President, who went on to serve two terms alongside Obama.\n\n**Background**\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution provides that the President and Vice President of the United States must be natural-born citizens of the United States, at least 35 years old, and residents of the United States for a period of at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the political parties, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Traditionally, the primary elections are indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.\n\n**Nominations**\n\nMedia speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential election were released. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates. Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore, the runner-up in the 2000 election; John Kerry, the runner-up in the 2004 election; John Edwards, Kerry's running mate in 2004; Delaware Senator Joe Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh.\n\n**Democratic Party Nomination**\n\nHillary Clinton and Barack Obama were the two main candidates vying for the Democratic nomination. Obama's campaign focused on inspiring a new generation of voters, while Clinton's campaign emphasized her experience and qualifications. The two candidates engaged in a series of debates and primaries, with Obama ultimately emerging as the nominee.\n\n**Republican Party Nomination**\n\nThe Republican nomination was contested by several candidates, including John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, and Fred Thompson. McCain ultimately emerged as the nominee, thanks in part to his strong performance in the primaries.\n\n**Early Primaries and Caucuses**\n\nThe Iowa caucuses were the first test of the candidates' strength. Barack Obama won the caucuses, thanks in part to his strong support among independents and first-time caucus-goers. John McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire, thanks to a strong turnaround victory.\n\n**Super Tuesday**\n\nSuper Tuesday was a critical day in the primary calendar, with contests held in over a dozen states. Barack Obama won several key states, including California, Illinois, and Ohio, while John McCain won several other states, including Arizona and Georgia.\n\n**Third Party and Other Nominations**\n\nAlong with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. These parties included the Constitution Party, the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party. In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.\n\n**Campaign Issues**\n\nThe campaign issues were dominated by the economy, healthcare, and foreign policy. John McCain's proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. Barack Obama's proposals, on the other hand, emphasized the need for government action to address the economic crisis.\n\n**Presidential Debates**\n\nThe presidential debates were sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a bipartisan organization. The debates were held in September and October 2008 and were moderated by experienced journalists.\n\n**Campaign Costs**\n\nThe reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years. According to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the total cost of the 2008 presidential election was over $1 billion.\n\n**Expense Summary**\n\nAccording to the FEC, the major candidates raised and spent the following amounts:\n\n* Barack Obama: $750 million\n* John McCain: $370 million\n* Ralph Nader: $4.5 million\n* Other candidates: $23.5 million\n\n**Internet Campaigns**\n\nThe 2008 presidential election was the first to feature a significant online component. Candidates raised money and communicated with voters through the internet, social media, and mobile phones.\n\n**Voter Demographics**\n\nThe voter demographics were dominated by white voters, but Obama also performed well among African American, Hispanic, and Asian voters.\n\n**Turnout**\n\nThe voter turnout was high, with over 131 million votes cast. This represented a record high turnout, with 63% of eligible voters casting ballots.\n\n**Results**\n\nBarack Obama won the election, carrying 365 electoral votes to John McCain's 173. Obama won 52.9% of the popular vote, while McCain won 45.7%.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe 2008 presidential election was a significant turning point in American politics. Barack Obama's victory marked a historic moment in American history, as he became the first African American to hold the office of President. The election also saw the election of Joe Biden as Vice President, who went on to serve two terms alongside Obama.\n\nThe election was marked by a significant shift in the demographics of the electorate, with Obama performing well among young, urban, and minority voters. The campaign issues were dominated by the economy, healthcare, and foreign policy, with Obama emphasizing the need for government action to address the economic crisis.\n\nOverall, the 2008 presidential election was a significant moment in American history, marking a new chapter in the country's political landscape.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

directly elect the president and vice president.\n\n\nNominations\nMedia speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential election were released In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of the U.S Congress [5] Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates [6] Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore, the runner-up in the 2000 election; John Kerry, the runner-up in the 2004 election; John Edwards, Kerry's running mate in 2004; Delaware Senator Joe Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh [7]\n\n\nDemocratic

after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008 [6] In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain [49] The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies [6] Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place [50] Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, Giuliani, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, and Texas Representative Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively [51] [52] [53] [54] McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements [55] In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul [56] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007 [57]\n\n\nBefore the primaries\nImmediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008 [6] In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain [49] The media

Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007 [57]\n\n\nEarly primaries and caucuses\nEarly in the year, the support for Barack Obama started to increase in the polls and he passed Clinton for the top spot in Iowa; he ended up winning the caucus in that state, with Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third [11] Obama's win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the \"candidate of change\" [11] Iowa has since been viewed as the state that jump-started Obama's campaign and set him on track to win both the nomination and the presidency [12] After the Iowa caucus, Biden and Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest [11]\n\n\nSuper Tuesday\nMcCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [63] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates [64] Huckabee was the \"surprise performer\", winning 5 states and 218 delegates [64] Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates [64] Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would \"forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win\" [65] His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses Romney endorsed McCain on February 14 [66]\n\n\nOhio, Texas, and Pennsylvania\nOn March 4, Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a \"surprise upset\" by 10%, [25] [26] although she did lead in the polling averages in both states [21] [27] She also carried the primary in Texas, but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton [28]\n\n\nIndiana and North Carolina\nOn May 6, North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana [32] [33] In the actual results, Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states, winning by a significant margin in North Carolina [34] and losing by only 1.1% in Indiana (50.56% to 49.44%) [35] After these primaries, most pundits declared that it had become \"increasingly improbable,\" if not impossible, for Clinton to win the nomination [36] The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month [37] Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates, it was not enough to overcome Obama's substantial delegate lead.\n\n\nFlorida and Michigan\nDuring late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states' moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008 Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates [38]\n\n\nClinching the nomination\nThe major political party nomination process (technically) continues through June of an election year In previous cycles, the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the primaries held in March, but, in this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month campaign against Hillary Clinton He had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states Now, because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama [40] By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the Associated Press found that her numbers were \"accurate only\" in one close scenario [41]\n\n\nRepublican Party nomination\nNot only was the 2008 election the first time since 1952 that neither the incumbent president nor the incumbent vice president was a candidate in the general election, but it was also the first time since the 1928 election that neither sought his party's nomination for president; as Bush was term-limited from seeking another nomination, the unique aspect was Vice President Cheney's decision not to seek the Republican nomination [46] [47] The 2008 election was also the third presidential election since 1896 in which neither the incumbent president, the incumbent vice president, nor a current or former member of the incumbent president's Cabinet won the nomination of either major party the others being 1920 and 1952 [48] With no members of the Bush administration emerging as major contenders for the Republican nomination, the Republican race was as open as the Democratic race.\n\n\nCandidate\n\n\n\nWithdrawn candidates\nImmediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for president in 2008 [6] In November 2006, former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John

(Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul [56] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007 [57]\n\n\nEarly primaries/caucuses\nHuckabee, winner of Iowa, had little to no money and hoped for at least a third-place finish in New Hampshire McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire McCain staged a turnaround victory, [58] having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race [59]\n\n\nSuper Tuesday\nMcCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [63] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates He also won

remaining primaries and caucuses Romney endorsed McCain on February 14 [66]\n\n\nThird party and other nominations\nAlong with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election These were the Constitution Party, the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.\n\n\nCandidates gallery\nUntil the onset of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the unpopular Iraq War was a key issue during the campaign John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it (Obama's early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign) Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II, [75] his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.\n\n\nParty conventions\nUntil the onset of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the unpopular Iraq War was a key issue during the campaign John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it

be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.\n\n\nBush's unpopularity\nGeorge W Bush had become increasingly unpopular among Americans by late 2005 due in part by the growing unpopularity of the Iraq War domestically and internationally, as well as Bush's handling of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 By the time Obama was elected as President of the United States on November 4, 2008, Bush's approval rating was in the low to mid 20s and his disapproval grew increasingly significant, being in the high 60s, and even low 70s in some polls [76] Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent [77] [78] [79] In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, [80] but did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office [81]\n\n\nAge issue\nSimilar to Senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, one of the more widely leveled charges against McCain was the issue of his age—he turned 72 in August and there was widespread concern about the idea of electing a man who would be 80 years old if he completed two full terms in office (the oldest president, Ronald Reagan, had been a month shy of 78 when he left office in January 1989) [82] [83] In addition, McCain suffered from the ill effects of his captivity in North Vietnam and reportedly had difficulty lifting his arms above his head His age in particular was considered a liability against the youthful Senator Obama, who was the first Generation Xer to run for president on a major party ticket [84] McCain for comparison was born before World War II and belonged to the Silent Generation [85] Much like Bob Dole, McCain attempted to counter these charges by releasing all of his medical records, something Obama did not do McCain's wife Cindy dismissed concerns about his health by arguing that \"We went hiking the Grand Canyon last summer and  [John] did great and had no trouble keeping up with us.\" McCain also appeared at several campaign stops with his still-active 95-year-old mother In a speech on the House floor, Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha criticized McCain's age by saying \"Seven presidents have come and gone since I've been in Congress, and I saw the toll the job took on each one of them.\" If elected, McCain would have been the first president born in the 1930s McCain ultimately died in 2018, [86] just one year after the completion of Obama's second term.\n\n\nEconomy\nPolls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters [95] [96] In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression [97] During this period, John McCain's election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.\n\n\nHealth care\nJohn McCain's proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a \"Guaranteed Access Plan\" [104]\n\n\nPresidential debates\nThe United States presidential election of 2008 was sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), a bipartisan organization that sponsored four debates that occurred at various locations around the United States (U.S.) in September and October 2008 Three of the debates involved the presidential nominees, and one involved the vice-presidential nominees.\n\n\nCampaign costs\nThe reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004) [114] In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007 [115]\n\n\nExpense summary\nAccording to required campaign filings as reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 148 candidates for all parties collectively raised $1,644,712,232 and spent $1,601,104,696 for the primary and general campaigns combined through November 24, 2008 The amounts raised and spent by the major candidates, according to the same source, were as follows:\n\n\nNotable expressions and phrases\nElections analysts and political pundits issue probabilistic forecasts of the composition of the

to newer and younger demographics Political pundits were now evaluating candidates based on their social media following.\nSenator Barack Obama's victory is credited to his competitive edge in social media and Internet following Obama had over 2 million American supporters on Facebook and 100,000 followers on Twitter, while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter Obama's YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary [126]\n\n\nControversies\nAllegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states: Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina [131] On October 5, 2008, the Republican Lt Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic [132] Allegations arose in Michigan that the Republican Party planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes [133] The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation [134]\n\n\nVoter suppression allegations\nAllegations of

coverage of the presidential election season An October 22, 2008 Pew Research Center poll estimated 70% of registered voters believed journalists wanted Barack Obama to win the election, as opposed to 9% for John McCain [141] Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain [142]\n\n\nTimeline\nElection Day was on November 4, 2008 The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting [151] Voters cast votes for listed presidential candidates but were actually selecting representatives for their state's Electoral College slate.\n\n\nConduct\nElection Day was on November 4, 2008 The

[160] The final tally of total votes counted was 131.3 million, compared to 122.3 million in 2004 (which also boasted the highest record since 1968, the last presidential election before the voting age was lowered to 18) Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters, 131.2 million votes could reflect a turnout as high as 63.0% of eligible voters, which would be the highest since 1960 [161] [162] This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000 [162] Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of 61.6%, which would be the highest turnout rate since 1968 [163] [164]\n\n\nBallot access\nNo other candidate had ballot access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes All six candidates appeared on the ballot for a majority  of the voters, while the 17 other listed candidates were available to no more than 30% of the voters [173]\n\n\nResults\nOf the 3,154 counties/districts/independent

[185] became the first African American as well as the first biracial president [186] Several black people had previously run for president, including Shirley Chisholm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton, though Obama was the first one ever to win the nomination of a major party, let alone the general election [187] The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history in which neither candidate was a white Protestant, as Biden is Roman Catholic and the first Roman Catholic to be elected vice president; all previous tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984) [188] The Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning ticket consisting of two sitting senators since 1960 (John F Kennedy/Lyndon B Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), and Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 Obama became the first Northern Democrat to win any state in the former Confederacy since Hubert Humphrey won Texas in 1968 This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major-party nominees was the incumbent president or vice-president.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nOpinion polling\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal

It was the easternmost hurricane to form in the tropical Atlantic in June, and it became the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record in the basin.\n\nMeteorological History\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave emerging off the coast of West Africa on June 25, producing disorganized showers south of Cabo Verde. By the evening of June 27, the satellite presentation of the disturbance was beginning to show some organization, with curved bands developing around a broad circulation. Environmental conditions at the time were described as being \"unusually conducive\" for tropical cyclogenesis across the central and western tropical Atlantic for late June, with near-record warm sea surface temperatures (SST) of about 82°F (28°C), light wind shear of 6–12 mph (9–19 km/h), plus high mid-level relative humidity of around 70%.\n\nThe disturbance developed further over the next day, with persistent thunderstorm activity occurring. The center of circulation became well-defined enough for the NHC to designate the system as Tropical Depression Two at 21:00 UTC on June 28, while located about 1,970 km (1,225 mi) east-southeast of Barbados.\n\nPreparations\nBarbados, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Saint Lucia were put under a hurricane warning on June 29. Tobago was also put under a hurricane warning on June 30, as was Martinique, along with a vigilance orange. Trinidad was under a tropical storm warning, and Dominica placed under a tropical storm watch. Caribbean Airlines postponed several flights between Barbados, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago on June 30. Virgin Atlantic and British Airways also canceled flights in the region as the storm approached.\n\nLesser Antilles\nBeryl moved through the Lesser Antilles as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, battering structures, uprooting trees, and causing near-total power and communication outages across much of the island chain. Hardest hit were Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) reported an estimated 200,000 people altogether in the two nations were affected, representing 100% of the population. Also greatly impacted was Barbados, where the Red Cross reported that 208,200 people, about 74% of the population, were affected by the hurricane. It is estimated that insurable losses across region from the hurricane will exceed US$1 billion, according to disaster projections by CoreLogic.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\nIn Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, eight fatalities have been confirmed. At least three of the dead were killed by flying debris, one man was crushed when part of his home collapsed, and another man bled out after being cut on the hand. Also, the MV Guidance II, a 150 ft-long (46 m) ferry with five crew members on board, has been missing from near Canouan Harbor since July 1, when Beryl passed through. The greatest damage was sustained on the islands of Canouan, Mayreau, and Union, where over 90% of homes were damaged or destroyed. Also, the Palm Island Resort, on nearby Palm Island suffered extensive damage.\n\nGrenada\nIn Grenada, the island of Carriacou was stripped of all vegetation and its marinas were significantly damaged. There, and on neighboring Petite Martinique, Beryl did significant damage to houses and buildings, and severely disrupted the electrical grid. On the island of Grenada, about 95% of residents were also without power, and telecommunications were down. Additionally, household water storage tanks and cisterns across the islands were either destroyed or compromised by the hurricane; the public water infrastructure also suffered significant damage. There were six fatalities altogether, among them: one person died in St George's when a tree fell upon their house, while two persons were killed on Carriacou.\n\nOther Islands and Venezuela\nBusinesses, homes, and roads in Barbados were flooded as Beryl passed nearby; also, roofs, trees, and electrical posts were damaged. The most consequential impact occurred along the coast, which was pummeled severely by storm surge. Approximately 90% of the nation's fishing fleet was damaged or destroyed. The Bridgetown Cruise Terminal also suffered damage.\n\nGreater Antilles\nHurricane Beryl produced gusty winds and rough surf in the Dominican Republic. The hurricane displaced 89 people and cut service to 57 aqueducts. Large waves scattered debris on a section of the Las Américas Highway in Santo Domingo. Storm surge flooding was reported in the neighborhood of Ciudad Nueva, detouring traffic. A landslide destroyed a home in La Zurza. Multiple beachfront shops in Boca Chica were damaged by rough waves. Four dwellings were destroyed by storm surge in La Ciénaga, Barahona, where an additional three houses were damaged.\n\nMexico\nBeryl brought heavy rains and high winds to Cancún and the Riviera Maya resort district along the Caribbean coast of Quintana Roo, resulting in downed trees and power lines, and damage to many roofs; there was also widespread flooding. Many areas lost electricity, including Tulum, Cozumel, and Islas Mujeres municipalities. Tourist infrastructure was without major damage. Beryl's high winds also resulted in fallen trees and power outages in Campeche, including Hopelchén Municipality.\n\nUnited States\nWind damage in the United States ranged from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, based on an estimate by CoreLogic. A prolific tornado outbreak spawned by Hurricane Beryl happened in eastern Texas, western Louisiana, and Arkansas on July 8. Overall, 113 tornado warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on July 8, the most for a single day in July, surpassing the 67 issued on July 6, 2005, which were related to Hurricane Cindy. The outbreak continued into July 9 with more tornadoes being confirmed, before impacting the interior Northeastern United States and Ontario on July 10. In all, 68 tornadoes were confirmed.\n\nTexas\nBeryl made landfall near Matagorda with the east side of the eyewall impacting Brazoria County. It produced wind gusts over 60–70 mph (97–113 km/h) with a peak gust of 97 mph (156 km/h) in Brazoria. Significant impacts from Beryl took place in Surfside Beach, where siding was completely ripped off from the second story of a house. Multiple A-frame homes along the beach were mostly destroyed as a result of Beryl's winds. Numerous other structures suffered extensive damage within the town. In Lake Jackson, Beryl's winds peeled back roofs, knocked down chimneys, and destroyed exterior brick facades.\n\nLouisiana\nIn Cameron Parish, Louisiana, portions of LA 27 and LA 82 alongside some roads in Lake Charles saw debris and heavy rainfall due to Beryl. As the storm traveled inland, it had brought severe weather to the northwestern side of the state, with several tornado warnings and power outages; there were 25 confirmed tornadoes in the state, including multiple large and long-tracked tornadoes. Six EF2 tornadoes were also confirmed, with one of them striking Pleasant Hill before causing additional damage north of the town. Unrelated to the tornado to the east of the town, a natural gas leak occurred on LA 174. Another EF2 tornado that injured a person west of Union Springs. Another large, low-end EF2 tornado tracked over 50 mi (80 km) passing through Barksdale Air Force Base, and killing a woman and injuring her two children east of Benton when it knocked a tree down onto her mobile home. An EFU tornado, three EF0 tornadoes, and 15 other EF1 tornadoes were also confirmed in the state, including the aforementioned EF1 tornado that caused an injury and crossed the state line into Texas and two other EF1 tornadoes that crossed into Arkansas. Over 20,000 SWEPCO customers lost power in Northwestern Louisiana.\n\nArkansas\nArkansas was battered by rain as Beryl moved through as a tropical depression. The highest rainfall total in the state was 8 in (200 mm) in Ico in Grant County. Areas in the Little Rock metropolitan area in Pulaski County received over 2 in (51 mm) of rain, with the peak total being 7.31 in (186 mm) in the Ferndale area. Although it had weakened, wind gusts up to tropical storm force were recorded in the state. The peak recorded gust was 47 mph (76 km/h) in Doddridge. Many tornado warnings were issued in the state as well; six EF1 tornadoes and two EF0 tornadoes were confirmed; two other EF1 tornadoes tracked out of Louisiana and into Arkansas. Almost 14,000 Arkansans were without power. An EF1 tornado was also confirmed in Mississippi.\n\nOhio Valley\nNorthern Indiana received over 4 in (100 mm) of rain from Beryl. On July 9, the remnants of Hurricane Beryl spawned a long-tracked supercell that produced six tornadoes in western Kentucky and southwestern Indiana. The first two tornadoes touched down in Kentucky, both of which caused EF1 damage. After crossing the Ohio River in Indiana the storm spawned a low-end EF3 tornado that heavily damaged an industrial area and derailed a train on the east side of Mount Vernon, Indiana. This tornado tracked north almost 35 mi (56 km) through Posey County into Gibson County, where it lifted near Johnson, Indiana. The storm later produced two EF1 tornadoes and an EF2 tornado as well. Separate storms also produced EF0 tornadoes near Dubre, Kentucky, and Shoals, Indiana, and an EF1 tornado near Snake Run. Beryl's remnants spawned over nine tornadoes in Southwestern Indiana and Northwestern Kentucky. Several tornado watches were issued in addition to flood warnings, watches, and advisories due to heavy rainfall across the Ohio Valley. In Illinois, gusts of up to 40 mph (64 km/h) were felt in the central region of the state. The highest gusts were felt at the Coles County Memorial Airport, 45 mph (72 km/h). Flood watches were issued in DuPage County. Many fields, especially in the southern portion of the state, were inundated with floods. About 2–4 in (51–102 mm) of rain fell in the state.\n\nGreat Lakes\nAs the storm's remnants moved over the Lower Peninsula of Michigan late that day and into the next day, 34 counties were put under a flood watch and eight under a flood advisory. Heavy rainfall in Southwest and Central Michigan resulted in localized flash flooding, power outages, and minor storm damage. The highest recorded rainfall totals occurred in Genesee County: 7.06 in (179 mm) at Richfield Center, and 6.79 in (172 mm) in Burton. Elsewhere, the top rainfall report was 5.95 in (151 mm) in Marshall, in Calhoun County.\n\nNew England\nTowns in northern New Hampshire were severely damaged, while roads were damaged and some bridges. Due to the flooding, around 20 people were left stranded at a Walmart and required rescuing. Monroe, Dalton, and Littleton were among the damaged towns.\n\nCanada\nThe remnants of Beryl brought torrential rainfall to southern Ontario on July 10, and into the next morning, causing localized flooding. It also put an end to a persistent heat wave, ending a heat warning for the Greater Toronto Area. Additionally, two weak EF0 tornadoes occurred in the London, Ontario, area; damage from tornadoes was limited to crops and trees.\n\nAftermath\nAfter the hurricane passed the Caribbean, the United Nations authorized $4 million in aid, with Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines getting $1.5 million and Jamaica receiving $2.5 million. The Government of Canada announced it would provide $1.2 million in humanitarian assistance. The United States Agency for International Development announced $4.5 million in humanitarian aid for countries affected by Beryl, including $2.5 million for Jamaica. The European Union authorized $450,000 in humanitarian aid for countries in the Lesser Antilles. The World Food Programme mobilized 5,000 food kits for affected countries in the Caribbean.\n\nRecords\nBeryl is the easternmost hurricane to form in the tropical Atlantic in June – 49.3°W, beating the mark set by the 1933 Trinidad hurricane – 58.9°W. Additionally, it became the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record in the basin, surpassing the previous record set on July 8, 2005, by Hurricane Dennis.

slacker who mocks the ambitions of his girlfriend (played by Winona Ryder) Film critic Roger Ebert called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: \"Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy (and is so convincing it is worth noting that he has played quite different characters equally well in movies as different as \"Alive\" and \"Dead Poets Society\").\" [25] The New York Times noted, \"Mr Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all.\" [26]\nThe following year Hawke

Roger Ebert called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: \"Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy (and is so convincing it is worth noting that he has played quite different characters equally well in movies as different as \"Alive\" and \"Dead Poets Society\").\" [25] The New York Times noted, \"Mr Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all.\" [26]\nThe following year Hawke received critical acclaim for his performance in Richard Linklater's 1995 drama Before Sunrise The film follows a young American man (Hawke) and a young French woman (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one

\"Hawke certainly isn't the greatest Hamlet of living memory .. but his performance reinforces Hamlet's place as Shakespeare's greatest character And in that sense, he more than holds his own in the long line of actors who've played the part.\" [45] In 2001, Hawke appeared in two more Linklater movies: Waking Life and Tape, both critically praised [46] [47] In the animated Waking Life, he shared

stronger, more intense acting than anyone might've predicted from him 20 years ago—drives the movie.\" [84] In the 2011 television adaptation of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Hawke played the role of Starbuck, the first officer to William Hurt's Captain Ahab [86] He then starred opposite Kristin Scott Thomas in Paweł Pawlikowski's The Woman in the Fifth, a \"lush puzzler\" about an American

Defence White Paper stated: \"The Government has ruled out nuclear propulsion for these submarines\" [15]\n\n\nNaval Group–Australia strategic partnership agreement\nIn 2009, two years after the start of the project to replace the Royal Australian Navy's conventionally-powered Collins-class submarines, the Australian Defence White Paper stated: \"The Government has ruled out nuclear propulsion for these submarines\" [15]\n\n\nAustralia–UK–US negotiations\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that in March 2021 the Australian navy chief Vice Admiral Michael Noonan met in London with his British counterpart Admiral Tony Radakin and requested assistance from the UK and the US in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines [43] The Daily Telegraph reported that British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab \"helped broker the deal\" [44] The New York Times too reported that Australia first approached the UK for assistance [45] The Wall Street Journal reported Australia approached the US in April 2021 [46] A trilateral discussion was held between Johnson, Biden and Morrison at the June 2021 G7 summit held in Cornwall, England [42] [47] The talks took place without the knowledge of the French government or Naval Group [44] This approach was possible as a result of the UK not entering into a formal foreign policy and security treaty in the post-Brexit deal with the EU As a result, the UK was free to pursue enhanced cooperation with other allies [48] Axios reported that the Biden administration sought assurances from Australia that cancelling the contract was not dependent on the US providing them with assistance and that cancelling was a fait accompli [49] Morrison said Australia had been considering an alternative to the Attack-class submarine deal for the past 18 months [42] [47]\n\n\nFeatures\nUnder the partnership, the US and UK will share nuclear propulsion technology with Australia, as they have done with each other since 1958 under the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement [37] [55] [41] The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) will acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons [41] The basic design and key technologies will be decided by the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Task Force an 18-month Department of Defence research project headed by Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, begun in September 2021 with assistance from the US and UK [41] [56]\n\n\nPillar 1 - Nuclear-powered submarines\nUnder the partnership, the US and UK will share nuclear propulsion technology with Australia, as they have done with each other since 1958 under the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement [37] [55] [41] The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) will acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons [41] The basic design and key technologies will be decided by the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Task Force an 18-month Department of Defence research project headed by Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, begun in September 2021 with assistance from the US and UK [41] [56]\n\n\nPillar 2 - Advanced Capabilities\nAUKUS Pillar 2 encompasses a wide array of activities (including many commonly referred to by the U.S government as international armaments cooperation) There may include information and personnel exchange, cooperative research, development, testing, and evaluation, and joint production In contrast to Pillar 1 activities, which will take decades to deliver results, Pillar 2 is likely to produce more immediate capability improvements [102]\n\n\nUndersea Capabilities\nUndersea capabilities, in the context of AUKUS, refer to systems and technologies that operate underwater but are not manned submarines [103] Pillar 2 activities in this area include the “AUKUS Maritime Autonomy Experimentation and Exercise Series,” which the three governments have described as “a series of integrated trilateral experiments and exercises aimed at enhancing capability development, improving interoperability, and increasing the sophistication and scale of autonomous systems in the maritime domain.” [104] The AUKUS governments are also working on the ability to deploy and recover UUVs from manned submarines (sometimes referred to as “launch and recovery”), conducting activities to develop and improve “the ability to launch and recover undersea vehicles from torpedo tubes on current classes of submarines to deliver effects such as strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.” [104] In November 2023, the United States Department of Defense announced that the AUKUS partners had participated in a joint exercise to demonstrate and improve capabilities relating to the protection of underwater infrastructure and the use of autonomous and semiautonomous undersea systems [105]\n\n\nQuantum Technologies\nAs part of the Quantum Technologies working group, the AUKUS nations have established the AUKUS Quantum Arrangement (AQuA), an initiative to coordinate U.S., British, and Australian RDT&E efforts concerning quantum technologies Initial AQuA efforts were expected to focus on developing alternate solutions for position, navigation, and timing (similar to current Global Positioning System capability) through trials and experimentation through 2025 [106] Additionally, the AUKUS governments announced in December 2023 that they were “accelerating the development of quantum technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing in military capabilities,” with a particular focus on improving “resilience for our trilateral forces in Global Positioning System-degraded environments and enhance stealth in the undersea domain.” [104]\n\n\nAdvanced Cyber\nThe announcement of AUKUS included the stated aim of improving \"joint capabilities and interoperability These initial efforts will focus on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities.\" [107] Tom Tugendhat, chair of the British Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, later commented on Twitter that \"Bringing together the military-industrial complex of these three allies together is a step-change in the relationship We've always been interoperable, but this aims at much more From artificial intelligence to advanced technology the US, UK and Australia will now be able to cost save by increasing platform sharing and innovation costs Particularly for the smaller two, that's game-changing.\" [108] Engineering & Technology pointed to the increasing expansion of Chinese technology firms such as Huawei, which has been excluded from tendering for participation in telecommunications networks by the US and Australia on national security grounds, and government vetoes over the attempted Chinese acquisition of American company Lattice Semiconductor and ongoing British consideration of proposed takeovers of local semiconductor firms [108] Engineering & Technology also pointed to the March 2021 statement of the US National Security Commission on AI, of the imperative to intensify local efforts but also \"rally our closest allies and partners to defend and compete in the coming era of AI-accelerated competition and conflict\" [108]\n\n\nHypersonic and Counter-Hypersonic Capabilities\nUnder the partnership, the three countries will cooperate to accelerate development of hypersonic missiles and defence against such missiles Hypersonic and counter-hypersonic cooperation was one of four additional areas of cooperation announced on 5 April 2022 [5] [109] Australia and the US have been cooperating on the development of hypersonic missiles since 2020 after signing an agreement to \"flight test full-size prototype hypersonic cruise missiles\" under the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE) [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nOther Pillar 2 activities\nThe AUKUS partners have announced they will “pursue opportunities in Long Range Fires under AUKUS Pillar II in 2024,” and have also announced the establishment of a Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC) program to constantly track, detect, and identify objects in deep space from up to 22,000 miles away from Earth (the first will be built in Western Australia and is expected to be operational by 2026, with the radars based in the UK and the US aimed to be completed by 2030) [113] [114] In addition, the U.S., British, and Australian governments have established a number of initiatives designed to support Pillar 2 efforts as a whole, such as the AUKUS Advanced Capabilities Industry Forum and the AUKUS Defense Investors Network [113] [103]\n\n\nExpansion\nSince the announcement of \"Pillar II\" of AUKUS, there has been persistent speculation that Japan will eventually join the partnership; American Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel wrote that Japan was \"about to become the first additional Pillar II partner\" in The Wall Street Journal on 3 April 2024 [115] [116] On 7 April 2024, the Financial Times reported that AUKUS defence ministers will announce on 8 April 2024 that they will launch talks related to the expansion of Pillar II of the alliance [117] While many officials in the US government advocate the inclusion of Japan in AUKUS, notably Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, there has been push back for months from the UK and Australia partly in order to focus on ironing out existing complications in AUKUS, however primarily over concerns that Japan lacks the security systems required to protect highly sensitive information [117] [118]\n\n\nJapan\nOn 12 April 2022, Sankei Shimbun reported that the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia were inquiring about Japan's participation in the security framework of AUKUS The newspaper added that the aim of said negotiations was related to the incorporation of Japanese hypersonic weapon development and the strengthening of electronic warfare capabilities [160] \nPrior to this, in November 2021, former prime minister Shinzo Abe in a virtual address to the Sydney Dialogue, welcomed the creation of AUKUS in the midst of an increasingly severe security environment, and called for greater Japan-AUKUS cooperation and integration concerning artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare capabilities [161] [162] [163]\nThe US denied inviting Japan into the security alliance, with Jen Psaki stating that Sankei Shimbun's report was \"inaccurate\" [164] \nThis was followed by another denial from Hirokazu Matsuno, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary [165] [166] On 10 December 2022, Australia's Minister for Defence announced their desire for Japan to join the partnership [167]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand has agreed to officially explore the potential benefits of joining Pillar 2 [120] In March 2023, New Zealand's defence minister Andrew Little said New Zealand had been offered the opportunity to discuss joining AUKUS for the non-submarine co-operation areas New Zealand has indicated it was \"willing to explore\" the proposal [121] [122] In July 2023, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told New Zealand reporters that the “door is open” for New Zealand, as well as other countries, to join the security partnership [123] [124] In December 2023, following the formation of a new government, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said that New Zealand was open to joining the non-nuclear pillar of the AUKUS agreement during a state visit to Australia [125]\n\n\nOthers\nThe following non-participating nations were also subject to media speculation about potentially joining:\n\n\nNuclear proliferation concerns\nThe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty allows non-nuclear-weapon states to produce the highly enriched uranium for naval reactor fuel [64] Nevertheless, the agreement to transfer US or UK nuclear submarine technology including possibly highly enriched uranium has been described as an act of nuclear proliferation, [137] [138] and has been criticised by scholars and politicians [138] [139] [140] In the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, scholar Sébastien Philippe criticised AUKUS and wrote \"we can now expect the proliferation of very sensitive military nuclear technology in the coming years, with literally tons of new nuclear materials under loose or no international safeguards.\" [138] James M Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote that \"the nonproliferation implications of the AUKUS submarine deal are both negative and serious For Australia to operate nuclear-powered submarines, it will have to become the first non-nuclear-weapon state to exercise a loophole that allows it to remove nuclear material from the inspection system of the International Atomic Energy Agency I have no real concerns that Australia will misuse this material itself, but I am concerned that this removal will set a damaging precedent In the future, would-be proliferators could use naval reactor programs as cover for the development of nuclear weapons.\" [141]\n\n\nComments and responses from participating countries\nThe federal opposition leader at the time, Anthony Albanese, of the Australian Labor Party, said that his party would support nuclear submarines as long as there was no requirement to have a domestic civil nuclear industry, no possession of nuclear weapons and that the deal is consistent with Australia's responsibilities under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty [145] Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating condemned the deal, saying \"This arrangement would witness a further dramatic loss of Australian sovereignty, as material dependency on the United States robbed Australia of any freedom or choice in any engagement Australia may deem appropriate\" [145] Former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd warned against overly obtrusive criticism of China and recommended that Australia focus on quietly improving military capability [146]\n\n\nAustralia\nThe federal opposition leader

world\" but said that the relationship with France was \"rock solid\" [40] Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said: \"After years of bullying and trade hostility, and watching regional neighbours like the Philippines see encroachment into their waters, Australia didn't have a choice, and nor did the US or UK  [to make the deal]\" [150] Former prime minister Theresa May questioned whether the UK would be forced into a war with China should Taiwan be invaded [151]\n\n\nUnited States\nPresident Joe Biden stated that the deal was a way to \"address both the current strategic environment in the (Indo-Pacific) region and how it may evolve\" [157] After a call between the French and US presidents, the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies It was agreed the process would continue in such manner [158] [159]\n\n\nInternational responses\nOn 12 April 2022, Sankei Shimbun reported that the United States, United

Australia that the Attack-class submarine project was to be cancelled only a few hours before it was publicly announced [12] [16] Le Monde reported that the original cost of the project in 2016 was €35 billion of which €8 billion (A$12 billion) was to go to French companies [169] [170] The project was reportedly going to employ 4,000 people in France over six years at Naval Group and its 200 subcontractors [170] The French government was angered by both the cancellation of the Attack-class submarine project and not being made aware of the negotiations that led to the AUKUS agreement [171] In a joint statement, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and armed forces minister Florence Parly expressed disappointment at Australia's decision to abandon their joint submarine program with France [172] [40]\n\n\nChina\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC)'s foreign affairs department spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, \"The nuclear submarine cooperation between the US, the UK, and Australia has seriously undermined regional peace and stability, intensified the arms race and undermined international non-proliferation efforts\" [187] Zhao also said \"The three countries should discard the Cold War zero-sum mentality and narrow geopolitical perspective\" [188] Spokesperson Hua Chunying said \"China is firmly opposed to the US, the UK and Australia's malicious exploitation of loopholes in the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards mechanism\" [189]\n\n\nOther countries\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who

no possession of nuclear weapons and that the deal is consistent with Australia's responsibilities under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty [145] Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating condemned the deal, saying \"This arrangement would witness a further dramatic loss of Australian sovereignty, as material dependency on the United States robbed Australia of any freedom or choice in any engagement Australia may deem appropriate\" [145] Former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd warned against overly obtrusive criticism of China and recommended that Australia focus on quietly improving military capability [146]\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nPrime Minister at the time, Boris Johnson said that the deal would create \"hundreds of high-skilled jobs\" and \"preserve security and stability around the world\" but said that the relationship with France was \"rock solid\" [40] Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said: \"After years of bullying and trade hostility, and watching regional neighbours like the Philippines see encroachment into their waters, Australia didn't have a choice, and nor did the US or UK  [to make the deal]\" [150] Former prime minister Theresa May questioned whether the UK would be forced into a war with China should Taiwan be invaded [151]\n\n**United States**\n\nPresident Joe Biden stated that the deal was a way to \"address both the current strategic

been open consultations between allies It was agreed the process would continue in such manner [158] [159]\n\n**International responses**\n\nOn 12 April 2022, Sankei Shimbun reported that the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia were inquiring about Japan's participation in the security framework of AUKUS The newspaper added that the aim of said negotiations was related to the incorporation of Japanese hypersonic weapon development and the strengthening of electronic warfare capabilities [160] Prior to this, in November 2021, former prime minister Shinzo Abe in a virtual address to the Sydney Dialogue, welcomed the creation of AUKUS in the midst of an increasingly severe security environment, and called for greater Japan-AUKUS cooperation and integration concerning artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare capabilities [161] [162] [163] The US denied inviting Japan into the security alliance, with Jen Psaki stating that Sankei Shimbun's report was \"inaccurate\" [164] This was followed by another denial from Hirokazu Matsuno, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary [165] [166] On 10 December 2022, Australia's Minister for Defence announced their desire for Japan to join the partnership [167]\n\n**France**\n\nThe French government received official notification from Australia that the Attack-class submarine project was to be cancelled only a few hours before it was publicly announced [12] [16] Le Monde reported that the original cost of the project in 2016 was €35 billion of which €8 billion (A$12 billion) was to go to French companies [169] [170] The project was reportedly going to employ 4,000 people in France over six years at Naval Group and its 200 subcontractors [170] The French government was angered by both the cancellation of the Attack-class submarine project and not being made aware of the negotiations that led to the AUKUS agreement [171] In a joint statement, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and armed forces minister Florence Parly expressed disappointment at Australia's decision to abandon their joint submarine program with France [172] [40]\n\n**China**\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC)'s foreign affairs department spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, \"The nuclear submarine cooperation between the US, the UK, and Australia has seriously undermined regional peace and stability, intensified the arms race and undermined international non-proliferation efforts\" [187] Zhao also said \"The three countries should discard the Cold War zero-sum mentality and narrow geopolitical perspective\" [188] Spokesperson Hua Chunying said \"China is firmly opposed to the US, the UK and Australia's malicious exploitation of loopholes in the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards mechanism\" [189]\n\n**Other countries**\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who told CNN that \"one of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable .. We want to know what happened and why.\" [236] [237] The EU also demanded an apology from Australia [238] President of the European Council Charles Michel denounced a \"lack of transparency and loyalty\" by the US [239] The EU said the crisis affects the whole union [240]\n\n**European Union**\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who told CNN that \"one of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable ..

outline:\n\n\nBackground\nIn 2009, two years after the start of the project to replace the Royal Australian Navy's conventionally-powered Collins-class submarines, the Australian Defence White Paper stated: \"The Government has ruled out nuclear propulsion for these submarines\" [15]\n\n\nNaval Group–Australia strategic partnership agreement\nIn 2009, two years after the start of the project to replace the Royal Australian Navy's conventionally-powered Collins-class submarines, the Australian Defence White Paper stated: \"The Government has ruled out nuclear propulsion for these submarines\" [15]\n\n\nAustralia–UK–US negotiations\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that in March 2021 the Australian navy chief Vice Admiral Michael Noonan met in London with his British counterpart Admiral Tony Radakin and requested assistance from the UK and the US in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines [43] The Daily Telegraph reported that British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab \"helped broker the deal\" [44] The New York Times too reported that Australia first approached the UK for assistance [45] The Wall Street Journal reported Australia approached the US in April 2021 [46] A trilateral discussion was held between Johnson, Biden and Morrison at the June 2021 G7 summit held in Cornwall, England [42] [47] The talks took place without the knowledge of the French government or Naval Group [44] This approach was possible as a result of the UK not entering into a formal foreign policy and security treaty in the post-Brexit deal with the EU As a result, the UK was free to pursue enhanced cooperation with other allies [48] Axios reported that the Biden administration sought assurances from Australia that cancelling the contract was not dependent on the US providing them with assistance and that cancelling was a fait accompli [49] Morrison said Australia had been considering an alternative to the Attack-class submarine deal for the past 18 months [42] [47]\n\n\nFeatures\nUnder the partnership, the US and UK will share nuclear propulsion technology with Australia, as they have done with each other since 1958 under the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement [37] [55] [41] The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) will acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons [41] The basic design and key technologies will be decided by the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Task Force an 18-month Department of Defence research project headed by Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, begun in September 2021 with assistance from the US and UK [41] [56]\n\n\nPillar 1 - Nuclear-powered submarines\nUnder the partnership, the US and UK will share nuclear propulsion technology with Australia, as they have done with each other since 1958 under the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement [37] [55] [41] The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) will acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons [41] The basic design and key technologies will be decided by the Nuclear-Powered Submarine Task Force an 18-month Department of Defence research project headed by Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, begun in September 2021 with assistance from the US and UK [41] [56]\n\n\nPillar 2 - Advanced Capabilities\nAUKUS Pillar 2 encompasses a wide array of activities (including many commonly referred to by the U.S government as international armaments cooperation) There may include information and personnel exchange, cooperative research, development, testing, and evaluation, and joint production In contrast to Pillar 1 activities, which will take decades to deliver results, Pillar 2 is likely to produce more immediate capability improvements [102]\n\n\nUndersea Capabilities\nUndersea capabilities, in the context of AUKUS, refer to systems and technologies that operate underwater but are not manned submarines [103] Pillar 2 activities in this area include the “AUKUS Maritime Autonomy Experimentation and Exercise Series,” which the three governments have described as “a series of integrated trilateral experiments and exercises aimed at enhancing capability development, improving interoperability, and increasing the sophistication and scale of autonomous systems in the maritime domain.” [104] The AUKUS governments are also working on the ability to deploy and recover UUVs from manned submarines (sometimes referred to as “launch and recovery”), conducting activities to develop and improve “the ability to launch and recover undersea vehicles from torpedo tubes on current classes of submarines to deliver effects such as strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.” [104] In November 2023, the United States Department of Defense announced that the AUKUS partners had participated in a joint exercise to demonstrate and improve capabilities relating to the protection of underwater infrastructure and the use of autonomous and semiautonomous undersea systems [105]\n\n\nQuantum Technologies\nAs part of the Quantum Technologies working group, the AUKUS nations have established the AUKUS Quantum Arrangement (AQuA), an initiative to coordinate U.S., British, and Australian RDT&E efforts concerning quantum technologies Initial AQuA efforts were expected to focus on developing alternate solutions for position, navigation, and timing (similar to current Global Positioning System capability) through trials and experimentation through 2025 [106] Additionally, the AUKUS governments announced in December 2023 that they were “accelerating the development of quantum technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing in military capabilities,” with a particular focus on improving “resilience for our trilateral forces in Global Positioning System-degraded environments and enhance stealth in the undersea domain.” [104]\n\n\nAdvanced Cyber\nThe announcement of AUKUS included the stated aim of improving \"joint capabilities and interoperability These initial efforts will focus on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities.\" [107] Tom Tugendhat, chair of the British Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, later commented on Twitter that \"Bringing together the military-industrial complex of these three allies together is a step-change in the relationship We've always been interoperable, but this aims at much more From artificial intelligence to advanced technology the US, UK and Australia will now be able to cost save by increasing platform sharing and innovation costs Particularly for the smaller two, that's game-changing.\" [108] Engineering & Technology pointed to the increasing expansion of Chinese technology firms such as Huawei, which has been excluded from tendering for participation in telecommunications networks by the US and Australia on national security grounds, and government vetoes over the attempted Chinese acquisition of American company Lattice Semiconductor and ongoing British consideration of proposed takeovers of local semiconductor firms [108] Engineering & Technology also pointed to the March 2021 statement of the US National Security Commission on AI, of the imperative to intensify local efforts but also \"rally our closest allies and partners to defend and compete in the coming era of AI-accelerated competition and conflict\" [108]\n\n\nHypersonic and Counter-Hypersonic Capabilities\nUnder the partnership, the three countries will cooperate to accelerate development of hypersonic missiles and defence against such missiles Hypersonic and counter-hypersonic cooperation was one of four additional areas of cooperation announced on 5 April 2022 [5] [109] Australia and the US have been cooperating on the development of hypersonic missiles since 2020 after signing an agreement to \"flight test full-size prototype hypersonic cruise missiles\" under the Southern Cross Integrated Flight Research Experiment (SCIFiRE) [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nOther Pillar 2 activities\nThe AUKUS partners have announced they will “pursue opportunities in Long Range Fires under AUKUS Pillar II in 2024,” and have also announced the establishment of a Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC) program to constantly track, detect, and identify objects in deep space from up to 22,000 miles away from Earth (the first will be built in Western Australia and is expected to be operational by 2026, with the radars based in the UK and the US aimed to be completed by 2030) [113] [114] In addition, the U.S., British, and Australian governments have established a number of initiatives designed to support Pillar 2 efforts as a whole, such as the AUKUS Advanced Capabilities Industry Forum and the AUKUS Defense Investors Network [113] [103]\n\n\nExpansion\nSince the announcement of \"Pillar II\" of AUKUS, there has been persistent speculation that Japan will eventually join the partnership; American Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel wrote that Japan was \"about to become the first additional Pillar II partner\" in The Wall Street Journal on 3 April 2024 [115] [116] On 7 April 2024, the Financial Times reported that AUKUS defence ministers will announce on 8 April 2024 that they will launch talks related to the expansion of Pillar II of the alliance [117] While many officials in the US government advocate the inclusion of Japan in AUKUS, notably Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, there has been push back for months from the UK and Australia partly in order to focus on ironing out existing complications in AUKUS, however primarily over concerns that Japan lacks the security systems required to protect highly sensitive information [117] [118]\n\n\nJapan\nOn 12 April 2022, Sankei Shimbun reported that the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia were inquiring about Japan's participation in the security framework of AUKUS The newspaper added that the aim of said negotiations was related to the incorporation of Japanese hypersonic weapon development and the strengthening of electronic warfare capabilities [160] \nPrior to this, in November 2021, former prime minister Shinzo Abe in a virtual address to the Sydney Dialogue, welcomed the creation of AUKUS in the midst of an increasingly severe security environment, and called for greater Japan-AUKUS cooperation and integration concerning artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare capabilities [161] [162] [163]\nThe US denied inviting Japan into the security alliance, with Jen Psaki stating that Sankei Shimbun's report was \"inaccurate\" [164] \nThis was followed by another denial from Hirokazu Matsuno, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary [165] [166] On 10 December 2022, Australia's Minister for Defence announced their desire for Japan to join the partnership [167]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand has agreed to officially explore the potential benefits of joining Pillar 2 [120] In March 2023, New Zealand's defence minister Andrew Little said New Zealand had been offered the opportunity to discuss joining AUKUS for the non-submarine co-operation areas New Zealand has indicated it was \"willing to explore\" the proposal [121] [122] In July 2023, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told New Zealand reporters that the “door is open” for New Zealand, as well as other countries, to join the security partnership [123] [124] In December 2023, following the formation of a new government, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said that New Zealand was open to joining the non-nuclear pillar of the AUKUS agreement during a state visit to Australia [125]\n\n\nOthers\nThe following non-participating nations were also subject to media speculation about potentially joining:\n\n\nNuclear proliferation concerns\nThe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty allows non-nuclear-weapon states to produce the highly enriched uranium for naval reactor fuel [64] Nevertheless, the agreement to transfer US or UK nuclear submarine technology including possibly highly enriched uranium has been described as an act of nuclear proliferation, [137] [138] and has been criticised by scholars and politicians [138] [139] [140] In the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, scholar Sébastien Philippe criticised AUKUS and wrote \"we can now expect the proliferation of very sensitive military nuclear technology in the coming years, with literally tons of new nuclear materials under loose or no international safeguards.\" [138] James M Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote that \"the nonproliferation implications of the AUKUS submarine deal are both negative and serious For Australia to operate nuclear-powered submarines, it will have to become the first non-nuclear-weapon state to exercise a loophole that allows it to remove nuclear material from the inspection system of the International Atomic Energy Agency I have no real concerns that Australia will misuse this material itself, but I am concerned that this removal will set a damaging precedent In the future, would-be proliferators could use naval reactor programs as cover for the development of nuclear weapons.\" [141]\n\n\nComments and responses from participating countries\nThe federal opposition leader at the time, Anthony Albanese, of the Australian Labor Party, said that his party would support nuclear submarines as long as there was no requirement to have a domestic civil nuclear industry, no possession of nuclear weapons and that the deal is consistent with Australia's responsibilities under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty [145] Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating condemned the deal, saying \"This arrangement would witness a further dramatic loss of Australian sovereignty, as material dependency on the United States robbed Australia of any freedom or choice in any engagement Australia may deem appropriate\" [145] Former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd warned against overly obtrusive criticism of China and recommended that Australia focus on quietly improving military capability [146]\n\n\nAustralia\nThe federal opposition leader at the time, Anthony Albanese, of the Australian Labor Party, said that

however, it plans to not get involved in foreign conflicts, \"unless we have a compelling strategic interest in doing so\", to reduce Canada's United Nations (UN) presence \"to a minimum\", withdraw from UN commitments the party sees as threatening \"our sovereignty\", to accept free trade agreements that protect Canada's economy \"from the threat of potentially hostile foreign investors\", and phase out development aid [111] [112] The party opposed Canadian military support for Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War and criticized NATO expansion in Eastern Europe [113] Bernier also took a neutral stance on the Israel–Hamas war, stating that he wanted to \"keep Canada out of this conflict in the Middle East\" [114]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nThe party has come out against Bill C-16, which added gender identity and expression as prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, and expressed a desire to modify Bill C-6, which bans conversion therapy, to add an exemption for youth with gender dysphoria [115]\n\n\nHealth care\nThe party's platform states \"it is up to the provinces to implement reforms in line with the more efficient and less costly mixed universal systems of other developed countries Throwing more federal money at the problem is not the right approach.\" [120] They plan to replace the Canada Health Transfer with a \"transfer of tax points of equivalent value to the provinces and territories\" by giving up the goods and services tax (GST) revenue collected by the federal government while creating a temporary program \"to compensate poorer provinces\" disadvantaged by the replacement [120] The party claims this would create the conditions for provincial and territorial governments to innovate, [121] while maintaining the Canada Health Act [122] The party has shown vaccine hesitancy Bernier and the PPC are opposed to vaccination mandates and support the lifting of pandemic restrictions [19] [123] [124] [125]\n\n\nImmigration\nThe party plans immigration reform, such as limiting immigration to no more than 150,000 people per year, by removing the parents and grandparents class from the family reunification program, focusing on economic immigration through the reform of the immigration point system, making temporary foreign workers noncompetitive with \"Canadian workers\", and banning birth tourism [126] [127] [128] They intend that all immigrants would undergo in-person interviews with immigration officials to determine whether their values and ideas accord with Canadian \"societal norms\" [129] [130] The party would declare the entire border a port of entry to make deportation easier, since new arrivals can be refused at ports of entry They would build border fences at popular ports of entry crossings for migrants, rely on private sponsorship instead of government support for funding new refugees, but prioritize those \"belonging to persecuted groups barred from neighbouring countries\" and sexual minorities [131]\n\n\nMulticulturalism\nThe party platform advocates for the cultural integration of immigrants, stating that it \"enriches\" Canadian society; in particular, the party criticized that the government \"has pursued a policy of official multiculturalism that encourages immigrants to keep the values and culture they left behind instead of integrating into Canadian society and adopting Canadian values and culture.\" Some of the examples that they have listed as \"distinct values of a contemporary Western civilization\" are \"equality between men and women\", \"separation of state and religion\", \"toleration and pluralism\" The party classified Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comments referring to Canada as \"the first post-national state, with no core identity\" as a \"cult of diversity\" It opposes the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, remarking that Canada's government should not help immigrants preserve their cultural heritage The party intends to \"repeal the Multiculturalism Act and eliminate all funding to promote multiculturalism.\" [132] [133]\n\n\nVeterans\nOn the topic of veterans, [134] the party platform says that \"The government of Canada has an obligation to honour the nation's sacred commitment to our military men and women and make sure our veterans receive the support they deserve.\" It also plans to \"enshrine in legislation the country's obligations to our veterans in a Military Covenant\", reinstate fair military disability pensions and reemphasize the legislative guarantee of the \"benefit of doubt\" standard in the Pension Act, review the New Veterans Charter to determine which policies and programs should be retained, simplify the system, and make it easier to navigate [63]\n\n\nSelf-defence\nAs part of Bernier's bid for the seat of Portage—Lisgar in 2023, the PPC published its \"self-defence policy\", stating it would remove pepper spray from the list of prohibited weapons and make it legal to possess and carry it for self-defence [135]\n\n\nAbortion\nThe party opposes abortion with Bernier promising that if he is elected to Parliament, one of the first things he will do is \"reopen the debate on abortion laws in Canada\" and push for more restrictions on abortion [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nElectoral results\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**People's Party of Canada**\n\nThe People's Party of Canada (PPC) is a federal political party in Canada.

The PPC also announced its opposition to further COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown measures, vaccine passports, and compulsory vaccinations as part of its campaign.\n\n**After the 2021 federal election**\n\nThe PPC organized a rally in Waterloo, Ontario, featuring Bernier and independent MPP Randy Hillier, to support the Freedom Convoy 2022's call to end COVID-19 mandates. The PPC candidate in the 2022 Mississauga—Lakeshore federal by-election garnered 1.2% of the vote. The PPC ran candidates in each of the 2023 federal by-elections, in the ridings of Winnipeg South Centre, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount, Portage—Lisgar, and Oxford. Party leader Maxime Bernier, who ran in Portage-Lisgar, won the highest number of votes at 17% but still lost the election.\n\n**Principles and policies**\n\nThe PPC has been described primarily as a conservative party with right-wing populist and libertarian policies. It is generally seen as being on the right to far-right of the left–right political spectrum. A number of political scientists have also described Bernier's rhetoric as reminiscent of classical liberalism; however, political scientist Brian Budd describes Bernier's rhetoric and the party's platform as reflective of the ideological tenets of a populist radical right, defined by a commitment to xenophobia.\n\n**Economy**\n\nProminent platform planks include ending corporate welfare and phasing out supply management over a number of years to allow farmers to adapt through compensation yet \"save Canadians billions of dollars annually\" through lower prices. Following the launch of the party, Bernier stated in a TV interview with BNN Bloomberg that the telecom industry deregulation, increasing airline competition, reducing tax brackets, and having a discussion about the privatization of Canada Post, which were key components of his original 2017 Conservative leadership platform, are all areas that he has an interest in.\n\n**Environment**\n\nThe party's platform states that \"it is an undisputed fact that the world's climate has always changed and will continue to change\" but rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, which it calls \"climate change alarmism.\" The party plans to withdraw from the global warming fight, withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord, abolish subsidies for green technology, expand the oil and gas industries, scrap \"the Liberal government's carbon tax,\" but allow the private sector and the provinces to address climate issues, and \"invest in mitigation strategies\" if negative effects result from climate change.\n\n**Foreign affairs**\n\nThe party platform says that foreign policies should be \"focused on the security and prosperity of Canadians, not an ideological approach that compromises our interests.\" It supports multilateralism, non-interventionism, free trade, and humanitarianism; however, it plans to not get involved in foreign conflicts, \"unless we have a compelling strategic interest in doing so,\" to reduce Canada's United Nations (UN) presence \"to a minimum,\" withdraw from UN commitments the party sees as threatening \"our sovereignty,\" to accept free trade agreements that protect Canada's economy \"from the threat of potentially hostile foreign investors,\" and phase out development aid.\n\n**LGBT rights**\n\nThe party has come out against Bill C-16, which added gender identity and expression as prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, and expressed a desire to modify Bill C-6, which bans conversion therapy, to add an exemption for youth with gender dysphoria.\n\n**Health care**\n\nThe party's platform states \"it is up to the provinces to implement reforms in line with the more efficient and less costly mixed universal systems of other developed countries Throwing more federal money at the problem is not the right approach.\" They plan to replace the Canada Health Transfer with a \"transfer of tax points of equivalent value to the provinces and territories\" by giving up the goods and services tax (GST) revenue collected by the federal government while creating a temporary program \"to compensate poorer provinces\" disadvantaged by the replacement. The party claims this would create the conditions for provincial and territorial governments to innovate, while maintaining the Canada Health Act.\n\n**Immigration**\n\nThe party plans immigration reform, such as limiting immigration to no more than 150,000 people per year, by removing the parents and grandparents class from the family reunification program, focusing on economic immigration through the reform of the immigration point system, making temporary foreign workers noncompetitive with \"Canadian workers,\" and banning birth tourism. They intend that all immigrants would undergo in-person interviews with immigration officials to determine whether their values and ideas accord with Canadian \"societal norms.\" The party would declare the entire border a port of entry to make deportation easier, since new arrivals can be refused at ports of entry. They would build border fences at popular ports of entry crossings for migrants, rely on private sponsorship instead of government support for funding new refugees, but prioritize those \"belonging to persecuted groups barred from neighbouring countries\" and sexual minorities.\n\n**Multiculturalism**\n\nThe party platform advocates for the cultural integration of immigrants, stating that it \"enriches\" Canadian society; in particular, the party criticized that the government \"has pursued a policy of official multiculturalism that encourages immigrants to keep the values and culture they left behind instead of integrating into Canadian society and adopting Canadian values and culture.\" Some of the examples that they have listed as \"distinct values of a contemporary Western civilization\" are \"equality between men and women,\" \"separation of state and religion,\" \"toleration and pluralism.\" The party classified Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's comments referring to Canada as \"the first post-national state, with no core identity\" as a \"cult of diversity.\" It opposes the Canadian Multiculturalism Act, remarking that Canada's government should not help immigrants preserve their cultural heritage. The party intends to \"repeal the Multiculturalism Act and eliminate all funding to promote multiculturalism.\"\n\n**Veterans**\n\nOn the topic of veterans, the party platform says that \"The government of Canada has an obligation to honour the nation's sacred commitment to our military men and women and make sure our veterans receive the support they deserve.\" It also plans to \"enshrine in legislation the country's obligations to our veterans in a Military Covenant,\" reinstate fair military disability pensions, and reemphasize the legislative guarantee of the \"benefit of doubt\" standard in the Pension Act.\n\n**Self-defence**\n\nAs part of Bernier's bid for the seat of Portage—Lisgar in 2023, the PPC published its \"self-defence policy,\" stating it would remove pepper spray from the list of prohibited weapons and make it legal to possess and carry it for self-defence.\n\n**Abortion**\n\nThe party opposes abortion, with Bernier promising that if he is elected to Parliament, one of the first things he will do is \"reopen the debate on abortion laws in Canada\" and push for more restrictions on abortion.\n\n**Electoral results**\n\nThe People's Party of Canada has contested several federal elections since its founding. In the 2019 federal election, the party ran candidates in 72 ridings and received 2.3% of the popular vote. In the 2021 federal election, the party ran candidates in 312 ridings and received 4.9% of the popular vote.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"People's_Party_of_Canada\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe PPC was formed a few weeks after the resignation of Maxime Bernier, a candidate in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election and former cabinet minister from the Conservative Party of Canada [21] In his resignation speech, Bernier stated that he was leaving because \"I've come to realize .. this party is too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed.\" Bernier also stated that under opposition leader Andrew Scheer, to whom Bernier finished runner-up in the 2017 party leadership election, the Conservative Party had abandoned its principles on issues including political correctness, corporate welfare, equalization payments reform, and supply management [22] In a National Post op-ed, Bernier stated that his motive for forming the party was to reverse the public choice dynamic in the Canadian political system resulting in vote-buying and pandering by political parties He reiterated his belief that the Conservative Party could not be reformed to end this practice, and that a new political party was required [23]\n\n\nFormation\nThe PPC was formed a few weeks after the resignation of Maxime Bernier, a candidate in the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election and former cabinet minister from the Conservative Party of Canada [21] In his resignation speech, Bernier stated that he was leaving because \"I've come to realize .. this party is too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed.\" Bernier also stated that under opposition leader Andrew Scheer, to whom Bernier finished runner-up in the 2017 party leadership election, the Conservative Party had abandoned its principles on issues including political correctness, corporate welfare, equalization payments reform, and supply management [22] In a National Post op-ed, Bernier stated that his motive for forming the party was to reverse the public choice dynamic in the Canadian political system resulting in vote-buying and pandering by political parties He reiterated his belief that the Conservative Party could not be reformed to end this practice, and that a new political party was required [23]\n\n\nRegistration\nThe party received its eligibility status on November 11, 2018 It was registered by Elections Canada on January 19, 2019, after nominating candidates for by-elections in Outremont, York—Simcoe, and Burnaby South which were called for February 25, 2019, and Nanaimo—Ladysmith [55] [56] [57] In the February 25 by-elections, the party received 10.9% of the vote in Burnaby South and 1.5% in each of York—Simcoe and Outremont [58]\n\n\nCandidate selections for the 2019 federal election\nBernier told the National Post that the party would start candidate nominations for the October general election after the by-elections [59] On March 25, 2019, Bernier announced in a press conference that the party has opened an online search for candidates until April 23, with candidate selection meetings to follow between May 7 and 13 [60] [61] In an interview on the CTV television show Power Play, he said that the party planned to have their first convention on June 1 to 2 [62] The party held their conference from August 18 to 19, where \"roughly 500 party officials took part in door knocking workshops, traditional media and social media training, debate training and mock debate.\" [63]\n\n\nAfter the 2019 federal election\nOn February 24, 2020, Elections Canada deregistered 38 of the party's EDAs for failing to comply with reporting requirements The deregistered EDAs would not be able to accept contributions or issue tax receipts unless they remedy their status with Elections Canada and become re-registered [74] Two candidates, including Maxime Bernier ran for the Toronto Centre and York Centre by-election, following the resignations of Michael Levitt and Bill Morneau;

{"title": "Incel", "content": "\nHistory\nThe first website to use the term \"incel\" was \"Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project\", founded in 1997 by a Canadian university student known only by her first name, Alana, to discuss her sexual inactivity with others; [32] [8] however, some media has incorrectly dated it to 1993, the date of a personal interaction that later inspired her to design the page [32] The site was used by people of all genders and sexual orientations to share their thoughts and experiences [32] [12] During 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, later shortened to \"incel\", for \"anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time\" [33] During her college years and after, Alana realized she was bisexual and became more comfortable with her identity [34] She stopped participating in her online project around 2000 and gave the site to a stranger [32] [35] [36] In 2018, Alana said of her project: \"It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today Things have changed in the last 20 years\" [33] When she read about the 2014 Isla Vista killings, and that parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, she wrote: \"Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it\" [37] [34] She expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an \"inclusive community\" for people of all genders who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness [30]\n\n\nExtremism\nIncel communities became more extremist and focused on violence from the late 2010s [53] [54] [18] This has been attributed to factors including influences from overlapping online hate groups and the rise of the alt-right and white supremacist groups [5] [55] [56] [53] The misogynistic and violent rhetoric of some members of these communities has led to numerous bans from websites and web hosts [19] [41] [57] [58] Incel communities continue to exist on more lenient platforms including 4chan, 8chan, and Gab, as well as on web forums created specifically for the topic [38] [59] [40] More extremist self-identified incels have increasingly migrated to obscure locations including gaming chat services and the dark web to avoid site shutdowns and the self-censorship that has developed among some incel communities as an effort to avoid drawing scrutiny from law enforcement or website service providers [40]\n\n\nForums\nThe largest incel forum was founded in 2017 by a previous moderator of the r/incels subreddit The forum had almost 15,000 members as of October 2022 [update] [13] [46] It is composed of public and registered message boards for self-described incels to discuss their personal experiences Moderators ban women and LGBT individuals from joining, justifying so by stating that the forum is oriented towards straight men [69] [70] Talia Lavin in her book Culture Warlords describes the site's culture as one of \"one-upmanship\", \"barroom boast-off\" and shock content [71] Rolling Stone describes a vindictive site culture, giving an example of an ex-moderator who entered a romantic relationship and was subsequently rejected by site members as a \"fake incel\" [72] Vox states that the site has a culture of praising mass killers, which is treated lightly by the site's admins [35]\n\n\nConnection to suicide forums\nIn September, the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published a report in September 2022 about the largest dedicated incel forum, based on monthly visits, and a network of other sites run by the same two pseudonymous individuals The Washington Post, New York Times, and the CCDH identified them as Uruguay-based Diego Joaquín Galante and United States–based Lamarcus Small [75] [76] [77] [78] In December 2021, the New York Times reported that it had identified 45 people, individually, who died in connection to a website called Sanctioned Suicide, [79] and estimated that the true number was likely much higher [80] [79] The Times reporters discovered that Galante and Small created and operated the suicide website, in addition to their several incel forums The CCDH reported that Galante and Small also maintained forums for online communities dedicated to body image and unemployment [75] [78]\n\n\nIdeology\nMany incel communities are characterized by resentment and hatred, self-pity, racism, misogyny, and misanthropy [25] Discussions often revolve around the belief that men are entitled to sex; other common topics include idleness, loneliness, unhappiness, suicide, sexual surrogates, and prostitutes, as well as attributes they believe increase one's desirability as a partner such as looks, income or personality [39] [81] [15] The incel community has a shared victimhood identity in which individuals fatalistically celebrate their failures and discourage each other from seeking romantic success [82] Many self-identified incels adopt the \"blackpill\" Additionally some focus on the \"scientific blackpill\", a series of social psychology studies that purport to scientifically prove their victimization [10] Opposition to feminism and women's rights is common, and some posters blame women's liberation for their inability to find a partner [83] Some believe there was a golden age in which couples married early, were strictly monogamous, and adhered to traditional gender roles They believe that during this time, looks played less of a role in romantic pairings and men's \"entitlement\" to sex with women was never denied [40] [84] Those holding this belief often disagree about precisely when this golden age occurred, but they concur that it was gradually destroyed by feminism, the sexual revolution, women's liberation, and technological progress [84] Racism is generally considered to be common on incel forums, [25] though some researchers have questioned its prevalence In 2019, Jaki et al estimated that 3 percent of comments on incel forums contained words from a list of racist words identified by the researchers [70] [85] Antisemitic beliefs are also regularly found on incel forums, with some posters going so far as to blame the rise of feminism on a plot masterminded by Jews to weaken the Western world [35] [40] Alexei Podnebesny, whom the media calls the leader of the incel movement in Russia, [86] [87] has developed his own theory of vaginocapitalism (from \"vagina\" and \"capitalism\"), according to which men are deprived of the right to sex by women, every man is forced to pay for it in some way [88] [89] [90]\n\n\n\"Blackpill\"\nThe \"blackpill\" (sometimes written as \"black pill\") generally refers to a set of beliefs mostly held by incel communities, which include biological determinism, fatalism, and defeatism for unattractive people [10] These beliefs are supported by continued reference on incel forums to scientific studies in fields such as psychology, sociology, and evolutionary biology; [93] [failed verification] labelling such studies collectively as the \"scientific blackpill\" Believers are referred to as being \"blackpilled\" [94] The black pill has been described by Vox correspondent Zack Beauchamp as \"a profoundly sexist ideology that .. amounts to a fundamental rejection of women's sexual emancipation, labeling women shallow, cruel creatures who will choose only the most attractive men if given the choice\" [35] The term was first popularized on the blog Omega Virgin Revolt, where it represented a belief that the entire social system was broken and that one's place in the system was not something any individual could change [95] [96] One who has \"taken the black pill\" has adopted the belief that they are hopeless, and that their lack of success romantically and sexually is permanent regardless of any changes they might try to make to their physical appearance, personality, or other characteristics [97] [96] [84] [40]\n\n\nScientific studies used as justification\nMany self-identified incels justify their prejudices using interpretations taken from concepts such as biological determinism and evolutionary psychology [97] [98] Self-identified incels also regularly endorse the ideas of \"female hypergamy\"; genetic superiority of men over women; the \"80/20 rule\" (an application of the Pareto principle) which suggests that 80% of women desire the top 20% of most attractive men; and, among non-white men within the subculture, the \"just be white\" (JBW) theory, which suggests that Caucasians face the fewest obstacles to relationships and sex [83] [99] [95] Self-identified incels also believe that people seeking a romantic or sexual partner participate in a cruel, mercenary, and Darwinian sexual selection, wherein incels are genetically unfit and where women hold an advantage for reasons ranging from feminism to the use of cosmetics [100] Incels may attribute their lack of sexual success to factors such as shyness, sex-segregated work environments, negative body image, [101] penis size, [99] or their physical appearance, [102] and commonly believe that the only thing more important than looks in improving a man's eligibility as a prospective partner is wealth [103] Some justify their beliefs based on the works of fringe social psychologist Brian Gilmartin and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson [39] [97] [104]\n\n\n\"Red pill\"\nThe \"red pill\" is an allusion that is common among manosphere communities, as well as some communities outside of the manosphere [105] It originates from the dilemma in the movie The Matrix where the protagonist must choose whether to remain in a world of illusion (taking the blue pill) or to see the world as it really is (taking the red pill) [40] [106] Among communities that use the term, the \"red pill\" often refers to the core set of beliefs of that community, and people who are \"redpilled\" or who have \"taken the red pill\" are those who hold those beliefs In manosphere communities such as men's rights groups and, according to some researchers, in incel communities as well, \"taking the red pill\" means seeing a world where feminism has given women too much power over men and male privilege does not exist [11] [106] [107] [96] The \"black pill\" is an extension of the red and blue pill analogy There is some disagreement among researchers and journalists over which beliefs are \"red pill\" and which are \"black pill\", and whether the black pill ideology is a distinguishing belief of the incel ideology or if there are self-identified incels who do not subscribe to black pill ideas Some researchers and journalists use the term \"red pill\" to refer to the set of beliefs commonly held by men's rights' activists, and the term \"black pill\" to summarize the incel ideology as a whole [11] [99] Hoffman et al have said that \"'Taking the black pill' is critical to the incel identity, since it means recognizing 'inceldom' as a permanent condition\" [40] Aja Romano writing for Vox has said, \"what unites all incels is something known as the black pill\" [11] Researchers at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) write that there are some incels who believe in the red pill and others who believe in the black pill [96]\n\n\nPromotion of violence\nSome discussions in incel communities endorse violence against sexually active women and more sexually successful men; [42] [108] [109] harassment of women, [110] including activities such as catfishing; [110] and suicide [111] According to the Anti-Defamation League, they form the most violent community within the manosphere [112] In some incel communities, it is common for posts to glorify violence by self-identified incels such as Elliot Rodger (perpetrator of the 2014 Isla Vista killings) and Alek Minassian (perpetrator of the 2018 Toronto van attack), [113] [114] [115] as well as by those they believe shared their ideology such as Marc Lépine (perpetrator of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre), [110] Seung-Hui Cho (perpetrator of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting), [116] and George Sodini (perpetrator of the 2009 Collier Township shooting) [117] Rodger is the most frequently referenced, often being referred to as their \"saint\" [114] with memes in which his face has been superimposed onto paintings of Christian icons Some incels consider him to be the true progenitor of today's online incel communities [35] The BBC described Rodger in 2020 as \"the founding father of the incel ideology\" [118]\n\n\nSexual violence\nA subgroup of self-identified incels who frequent websites founded by Nathan Larson, who was a perennial political candidate and active participant in incel communities, work deliberately to convince other self-identified incels that they are justified in raping women if they are rejected sexually [35] Some self-identified incels describe women's sexual rejection of them as \"reverse rape\", a phenomenon they consider to be equally harmful as rape [112]\n\n\nIn context of related communities\nIncel communities are a part of the broader manosphere, a loose collection of misogynist movements that also includes men's rights activists (MRAs), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), pickup artists (PUAs), and fathers' rights groups [121] [122] Journalists for the New York Times in 2018 wrote that involuntary celibacy is an adaptation of the idea of \"male supremacy\" and that the communities have evolved into a movement \"made up of people—some celibate, some not—who believe that women should be treated as sexual objects with few rights\" [123] [104] The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) also described the subculture as \"part of the online male supremacist ecosystem\", which they began including in their list of hate groups in 2018 [28] While the incel ideology involves the belief that one is physically inferior to the rest of society, often referring to oneself as \"subhuman\", researchers have agreed that self-identified incels also espouse supremacist views: either that they are superior to women, or superior to non-incels in general [84] [15] [98] [124] A 2019 study published in Terrorism and Political Violence found that self-identified incels believe themselves to be the only ones who are \"capable of pro-social values and intelligent enough ('high IQ') to see the truth about the social world\" The study determined that they followed a pattern that is typical of extremist groups, ascribing highly negative values to out-groups and positive values to in-groups, with the unusual caveat that despite seeing themselves as psychologically superior, they also view themselves negatively in terms of physical appearance [84]\n\n\nLexicology\nThe term \"involuntary celibate\" (shortened to \"incel\") refers to self-identifying members of an online subculture based around the inability to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one, a state they describe as \"inceldom\" or \"incelibacy\" [4] [5] [6] [128] It is sometimes used interchangeably or alongside other terms, such as \"love-shy\" (describing those with social anxiety or excessive shyness preventing romantic success), [38] [129] \"FA\" (short for \"forever alone\"), [130] \"unfuckability\", [131] \"omegas\", [132] \"betas\", [133] \"betafags\", [121] \"the undersexed\", [134] or \"the sexless\" [23] Alana, the coiner of the term \"incel\", initially considered using other terms such as \"perpetually single\" or \"dating shy\" [36]\n\n\nDemographics\nSelf-identified incels are mostly male and heterosexual, and are often described as young and friendless introverts [146] Estimates of the size of incel communities during 2018–2020 varied, [39] [132] [147] and ranged from the thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands [30] [35] [93] [148] A statistical analysis of the largest incel forum shows that only a few hundred accounts made up the vast majority of forum posts during all of 2021 and most of 2022 [78] Approximately half of incels live with their parents or grandparents [149]\n\n\nFemale incels\nThe first incel website, Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project, was gender-inclusive [154] There have been more contemporary female-specific incel (or \"femcel\") communities, such as r/TruFemcels [155] and its successor ThePinkPill [156] [157] As of February 2020 [update], the most popular female incel forum was the r/TruFemcels subreddit, with over 22,000 members [155] It was banned in January 2021 for violating Reddit's rules against promoting hate [157] [156] Another subreddit reportedly associated with self-identified female incels is r/Vindicta, which contains beauty advice [158] [159] There are also hashtags pertaining to the idea of female incels in use on TikTok, such as #femcel, #femcelcore and #femcelrights, which as of 2022, have over 250 million views [160] There are reported to be tens of thousands of women self-identifying as female incels on the internet [155]\n\n\nMental health\n\"Involuntary celibacy\" is not a medical or psychological condition Some people who identify as incel have physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism, and body dysmorphic disorder [98] A 2022 study found that self-identified incels had higher rates of depression, anxiety, and formal mental diagnoses than the general population: 95% reported depression and 93% reported anxiety 38% had clinical diagnoses [171] [91]\n\n\nMass murders and violence\nMass murders and other violent attacks have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies Other intended attacks by such individuals have been thwarted by police before being carried out.\n\n\n2000s\nOn August 4, 2009, George Sodini opened fire at an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Three women were murdered and nine other people were injured before Sodini killed himself [173] [174] He purportedly expressed sexual frustration and complained of constant rejections by women on a website registered in his name [175] Sodini and his actions have been embraced and glorified by some members of incel communities, who sometimes refer to incel violence as \"going Sodini\" [117] [176]\n\n\n2010s\nElliot Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others before killing himself in Isla Vista, California on May 23, 2014, near the campus of University of California, Santa Barbara These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and YouTube videos in which he detailed his involuntary celibacy and discussed how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women [36] [177] [178] [117] He had been an active member of a community popular among incels called PUAHate (short for \"pickup artist hate\"), and referenced it several times in his manifesto [117] [179] [180] [181] Although PUAHate shut down soon after the attack, Rodger became something of a martyr to some communities that remained, and to some of those that emerged later [27] [47] [182] It is common to see references to \"E.R.\" in incel forums, and mass violence by incels is regularly referred to as \"going E.R.\" [112] [40] Rodger has been referenced by the perpetrators or suspected perpetrators of several other mass killings, and is one of several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities [114] [117]\n\n\n2020s\nOn February 24, 2020, a female spa worker was stabbed to death in an attack that also severely injured her female coworker at an erotic massage parlor in Toronto On May 19, the Toronto Police Service declared the attack was being treated as a terrorist incident after evidence pointed to the stabbings being motivated by incel ideology, and police laid charges against a 17-year-old male alleged to have committed the stabbings This was the first time violence thought to be motivated by incel ideologies was prosecuted as an act of terrorism, and is also believed to be the first act of violence not perpetrated by an Islamist extremist to be prosecuted as terrorism in Canada [66] On September 14, 2022, the perpetrator entered a guilty plea to murder and attempted murder [204] [205] [206] The attack was ruled a terrorist attack during sentencing proceedings [207]\n\n\nCriticism\nIncel communities have been criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist [4] [5] [145] [110] [56] Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums \"play [s] a very large role\" in the radicalization of their members, and describes incel forums as having \"more violent rhetoric than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites\" [53] Journalist David Futrelle has described incel communities as \"violently misogynistic\", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups [53] [110] [56] [219] Psychologist and sex researcher James Cantor has described incels as \"a group of people who usually lack sufficient social skills and .. find themselves very frustrated\" He has said that in incel forums \"when they're surrounded by other people with similar frustrations, they kind of lose track of what typical discourse is, and they drive themselves into more and more extreme beliefs\" [220] Senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Amarnath Amarasingam, has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying \"under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence\" [12] Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of men in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders, and to online campaigns convincing people to join ISIL Speaking about their feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude \"can go as far as the justification of rape\" [48]\n\n\nOf the subculture\nIncel communities have been criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist [4] [5] [145] [110] [56] Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums \"play [s] a

promote anorexia and other eating disorders, and to online campaigns convincing people to join ISIL Speaking about their feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude \"can go as far as the justification of rape\" [48]\n\n\nOf platforms providing services to incel communities\nCriticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content, including Reddit (which banned the r/incels community in 2017, and banned most of the remaining incel communities in September 2019, but is still home to some identifying as incels) and Twitter [56] [45] Cloudflare, which provides services including DDoS protection, caching and obsfucation of the source host of the content, [225] has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against downtime even when webhosts have terminated service [226]\n\n\nOf reporting and research\nReporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its \"breathless\" coverage, for normalizing incel communities by describing them only as \"sexually frustrated\", and for directing readers to incel communities [227] Some reporting has also been criticized for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length, or for victim blaming by implying that women who had rejected the attackers' romantic or sexual advances held some responsibility for provoking the attacks [228] [229] Those who have written sympathetically about incels have faced criticism for legitimizing the incel ideology, such as from Samantha Cole in Vice who condemned media outlets who \"cove [r] and amplif [y] toxic internet culture as if it's valid ideology\" [224]\n\n\nPortrayals in fiction\nIn his debut novel Whatever (1994), French writer Michel Houellebecq seems to portray early examples of incels However, the term did not yet exist at the time; neither did the online communities The unnamed, 30-year-old protagonist looks unattractive, lacks social skills and suffers from depression, which means that despite his excellent job as an IT professional, he is not popular with women Things are much worse for his colleague, who is downright ugly and still a virgin at 28 The main character tries to seduce his friend into killing a young woman who has rejected him, which his friend refuses at the last moment In this novel, the main protagonist philosophizes about the disastrous consequences of the sexual revolution Because of sexual liberalism, the market mechanism has come to determine human relationships As a consequence, beautiful people get everything, ugly people get nothing [230] [231] [232]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Involuntary Celibacy (Incel)**\n\nInvoluntary celibacy, commonly referred to as \"incel,\" is a term used to describe a subculture of individuals who identify as unable to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one.

The novel explores themes of sexual inactivity, loneliness, and the consequences of the sexual revolution.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Incel\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe first website to use the term \"incel\" was \"Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project\", founded in 1997 by a Canadian university student known only by her first name, Alana, to discuss her sexual inactivity with others; [32] [8] however, some media has incorrectly dated it to 1993, the date of a personal interaction that later inspired her to design the page [32] The site was used by people of all genders and sexual orientations to share their thoughts and experiences [32] [12] During 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, later shortened to \"incel\", for \"anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time\" [33] During her college years and after, Alana realized she was bisexual and became more comfortable with her identity [34] She stopped participating in her online project around 2000 and gave the site to a stranger [32] [35] [36] In 2018, Alana said of her project: \"It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today Things have changed in the last 20 years\" [33] When she read about the 2014 Isla Vista killings, and that parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, she wrote: \"Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it\" [37] [34] She expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an \"inclusive community\" for people of all genders who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness [30]\n\n\nExtremism\nIncel communities became more extremist and focused on violence from the late 2010s [53] [54] [18] This has been attributed to factors including influences from overlapping online hate groups and the rise of the alt-right and white supremacist groups [5] [55] [56] [53] The misogynistic and violent rhetoric of some members of these communities has led to numerous bans from websites and web hosts [19] [41] [57] [58] Incel communities continue to exist on more lenient platforms including 4chan, 8chan, and Gab, as well as on web forums created specifically for the topic [38] [59] [40] More extremist self-identified incels have increasingly migrated to obscure locations including gaming chat services and the dark web to avoid site shutdowns and the self-censorship that has developed among some incel communities as an effort to avoid drawing scrutiny from law enforcement or website service providers [40]\n\n\nForums\nThe largest incel forum was founded in 2017 by a previous moderator of the r/incels subreddit

Moderators ban women and LGBT individuals from joining, justifying so by stating that the forum is oriented towards straight men [69] [70] Talia Lavin in her book Culture Warlords describes the site's culture as one of \"one-upmanship\", \"barroom boast-off\" and shock content [71] Rolling Stone describes a vindictive site culture, giving an example of an ex-moderator who entered a romantic relationship and was subsequently rejected by site members as a \"fake incel\" [72] Vox states that the site has a culture of praising mass killers, which is treated lightly by the site's admins [35]\n\n\nConnection to suicide forums\nIn September, the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published a report in September 2022 about the largest dedicated incel forum, based on monthly visits, and a network of other sites run by the same two pseudonymous individuals The Washington Post, New York Times, and the CCDH identified them as Uruguay-based Diego Joaquín Galante and United States–based Lamarcus Small [75] [76] [77] [78] In December 2021, the New York Times reported that it had identified 45 people, individually, who died in connection to a website called Sanctioned Suicide, [79] and estimated that the true number was likely much higher [80] [79] The Times reporters discovered that Galante and Small created and operated the suicide website, in addition to their several incel forums The CCDH reported that Galante and Small also maintained forums for online communities dedicated to body image and unemployment [75] [78]\n\n\nIdeology\nMany incel communities are characterized by resentment and hatred, self-pity, racism, misogyny, and misanthropy [25] Discussions often revolve around the belief that men are entitled to sex; other common topics include idleness, loneliness, unhappiness, suicide, sexual surrogates, and prostitutes, as well as attributes they believe increase one's desirability as a partner such as looks, income or personality [39] [81] [15] The incel community has a shared victimhood identity in which individuals fatalistically celebrate their failures and discourage each other from seeking romantic success [82] Many self-identified incels adopt the \"blackpill\" Additionally some focus on the \"scientific blackpill\", a series of social psychology studies that purport to scientifically prove their victimization [10] Opposition to feminism and women's rights is common, and some posters blame women's liberation for their inability to find a partner [83] Some believe there was a golden age in which couples married early, were strictly monogamous, and adhered to traditional gender roles They believe that during this time, looks played less of a role in romantic pairings and men's \"entitlement\" to sex with women was never denied [40] [84] Those holding this belief often disagree about precisely when this golden age occurred, but they concur that it was gradually destroyed by feminism, the sexual revolution, women's liberation, and technological progress [84] Racism is generally considered to be common on incel forums, [25] though some researchers have questioned its prevalence In 2019, Jaki et al estimated that 3 percent of comments on incel forums contained words from a list of racist words identified by the researchers [70] [85] Antisemitic beliefs are also regularly found on incel forums, with some posters going so far as to blame the rise of feminism on a plot masterminded by Jews to weaken the Western world [35] [40] Alexei Podnebesny, whom the media calls the leader of the incel movement in Russia, [86] [87] has developed his own theory of vaginocapitalism (from \"vagina\" and \"capitalism\"), according to which men are deprived of the right to sex by women, every man is forced to pay for it in some way [88] [89] [90]\n\n\n\"Blackpill\"\nThe \"blackpill\" (sometimes written as \"black pill\") generally refers to a set of beliefs mostly held by incel communities, which include biological determinism, fatalism, and defeatism for unattractive people [10] These beliefs are supported by continued reference on incel forums to scientific studies in fields such as psychology, sociology, and evolutionary biology; [93] [failed verification] labelling such studies collectively as the \"scientific blackpill\" Believers are referred to as being \"blackpilled\" [94] The black pill has been described by Vox correspondent Zack Beauchamp as \"a profoundly sexist ideology that .. amounts to a fundamental rejection of women's sexual emancipation, labeling women shallow, cruel creatures who will choose only the most attractive men if given the choice\" [35] The term was first popularized on the blog Omega Virgin Revolt, where it represented a belief that the entire social system was broken and that one's place in the system was not something any individual could change [95] [96] One who has \"taken the black pill\" has adopted the belief that they are hopeless, and that their lack of success romantically and sexually is permanent regardless of any changes they might try to make to their physical appearance, personality, or other characteristics [97] [96] [84] [40]\n\n\nScientific studies used as justification\nMany self-identified incels justify their prejudices using interpretations taken from concepts such as biological determinism and evolutionary psychology [97] [98] Self-identified incels also regularly endorse the ideas of \"female hypergamy\"; genetic superiority of men over women; the \"80/20 rule\" (an application of the Pareto principle) which suggests that 80% of women desire the top 20% of most attractive men; and, among non-white men within the subculture, the \"just be white\" (JBW) theory, which suggests that Caucasians face the fewest obstacles to relationships and sex [83] [99] [95] Self-identified incels also believe that people seeking a romantic or sexual partner participate in a cruel, mercenary, and Darwinian sexual selection, wherein incels are genetically unfit and where women hold an advantage for reasons ranging from feminism to the use of cosmetics [100] Incels may attribute their lack of sexual success to factors such as shyness, sex-segregated work environments, negative body image, [101] penis size, [99] or their physical appearance, [102] and commonly believe that the only thing more important than looks in improving a man's eligibility as a prospective partner is wealth [103] Some justify their beliefs based on the works of fringe social psychologist Brian Gilmartin and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson [39] [97] [104]\n\n\n\"Red pill\"\nThe \"red pill\" is an allusion that is common among manosphere communities, as well as some communities outside of the manosphere [105] It originates from the dilemma in the movie The Matrix where the protagonist must choose whether to remain in a world of illusion (taking the blue pill) or to see the world as it really is (taking the red pill) [40] [106] Among communities that use the term, the \"red pill\" often refers to the core set of beliefs of that community, and people who are \"redpilled\" or who have \"taken the red pill\" are those who hold those beliefs In manosphere communities such as men's rights groups and, according to some researchers, in incel communities as well, \"taking the red pill\" means seeing a world where feminism has given women too much power over men and male privilege does not exist [11] [106] [107] [96] The \"black pill\" is an extension of the red and blue pill analogy There is some disagreement among researchers and journalists over which beliefs are \"red pill\" and which are \"black pill\", and whether the black pill ideology is a distinguishing belief of the incel ideology or if there are self-identified incels who do not subscribe to black pill ideas Some researchers and journalists use the term \"red pill\" to refer to the set of beliefs commonly held by men's rights' activists, and the term \"black pill\" to summarize the incel ideology as a whole [11] [99] Hoffman et al have said that \"'Taking the black pill' is critical to the incel identity, since it means recognizing 'inceldom' as a permanent condition\" [40] Aja Romano writing for Vox has said, \"what unites all incels is something known as the black pill\" [11] Researchers at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) write that there are some incels who believe in the red pill and others who believe in the black pill [96]\n\n\nPromotion of violence\nSome discussions in incel communities endorse violence against sexually active women and more sexually successful men; [42] [108] [109] harassment of women, [110] including activities such as catfishing; [110] and suicide [111] According to the Anti-Defamation League, they form the most violent community within the manosphere [112] In some incel communities, it is common for posts to glorify violence by self-identified incels such as Elliot Rodger (perpetrator of the 2014 Isla Vista killings) and Alek Minassian (perpetrator of the 2018 Toronto van attack), [113] [114] [115] as well as by those they believe shared their ideology such as Marc Lépine (perpetrator of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre), [110] Seung-Hui Cho (perpetrator of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting), [116] and George Sodini (perpetrator of the 2009 Collier Township shooting) [117] Rodger is the most frequently referenced, often being referred to as their \"saint\" [114] with memes in which his face has been superimposed onto paintings of Christian icons Some incels consider him to be the true progenitor of today's online incel communities [35] The BBC described Rodger in 2020 as \"the founding father of the incel ideology\" [118]\n\n\nSexual violence\nA subgroup of self-identified incels who frequent websites founded by Nathan Larson, who was a perennial political candidate and active participant in incel communities, work deliberately to convince other self-identified incels that they are justified in raping women if they are rejected sexually [35] Some self-identified incels describe women's sexual rejection of them as \"reverse rape\", a phenomenon they consider to be equally harmful as rape [112]\n\n\nIn context of related communities\nIncel communities are a part of the broader manosphere, a loose collection of misogynist movements that also includes men's rights activists (MRAs), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), pickup artists (PUAs), and fathers' rights groups [121] [122] Journalists for the New York Times in 2018 wrote that involuntary celibacy is an adaptation of the idea of \"male supremacy\" and that the communities have evolved into a movement \"made up of people—some celibate, some not—who believe that women should be treated as sexual objects with few rights\" [123] [104] The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) also described the subculture as \"part of the online male supremacist ecosystem\", which they began including in their list of hate groups in 2018 [28] While the incel ideology involves the belief that one is physically inferior to the rest of society, often referring to oneself as \"subhuman\", researchers have agreed that self-identified incels also espouse supremacist views: either that they are superior to women, or superior to non-incels in general [84] [15] [98] [124] A 2019 study published in Terrorism and Political Violence found that self-identified incels believe themselves to be the only ones who are \"capable of pro-social values and intelligent enough ('high IQ') to see the truth about the social world\" The study determined that they followed a pattern that is typical of extremist groups, ascribing highly negative values to out-groups and positive values to in-groups, with the unusual caveat that despite seeing themselves as psychologically superior, they also view themselves negatively in terms of physical appearance [84]\n\n\nLexicology\nThe term \"involuntary celibate\" (shortened to \"incel\") refers to self-identifying members of an online subculture based around the inability to find a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one, a state they describe as \"inceldom\" or \"incelibacy\" [4] [5] [6] [128] It is sometimes used interchangeably or alongside other terms, such as \"love-shy\" (describing those with social anxiety or excessive shyness preventing romantic success), [38] [129] \"FA\" (short for \"forever alone\"), [130] \"unfuckability\", [131] \"omegas\", [132] \"betas\", [133] \"betafags\", [121] \"the undersexed\", [134] or \"the sexless\" [23] Alana, the coiner of the term \"incel\", initially considered using other terms such as \"perpetually single\" or \"dating shy\" [36]\n\n\nDemographics\nSelf-identified incels are mostly male and heterosexual, and are often described as young and friendless introverts [146] Estimates of the size of incel communities during 2018–2020 varied, [39] [132] [147] and ranged from the thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands [30] [35] [93] [148] A statistical analysis of the largest incel forum shows that only a few hundred accounts made up the vast majority of forum posts during all of 2021 and most of 2022 [78] Approximately half of incels live with their parents or grandparents [149]\n\n\nFemale incels\nThe first incel website, Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project, was gender-inclusive [154] There have been more contemporary female-specific incel (or \"femcel\") communities, such as r/TruFemcels [155] and its successor ThePinkPill [156] [157] As of February 2020 [update], the most popular female incel forum was the r/TruFemcels subreddit, with over 22,000 members [155] It was banned in January 2021 for violating Reddit's rules against promoting hate [157] [156] Another subreddit reportedly associated with self-identified female incels is r/Vindicta, which contains beauty advice [158] [159] There are also hashtags pertaining to the idea of female incels in use on TikTok, such as #femcel, #femcelcore and #femcelrights, which as of 2022, have over 250 million views [160] There are reported to be tens of thousands of women self-identifying as female incels on the internet [155]\n\n\nMental health\n\"Involuntary celibacy\" is not a medical or psychological condition Some people who identify as incel have physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism, and body dysmorphic disorder [98] A 2022 study found that self-identified incels had higher rates of depression, anxiety, and formal mental diagnoses than the general population: 95% reported depression and 93% reported anxiety 38% had clinical diagnoses [171] [91]\n\n\nMass murders and violence\nMass murders and other violent attacks have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies Other intended attacks by such individuals have been thwarted by police before being carried out.\n\n\n2000s\nOn August 4, 2009, George Sodini opened fire at an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Three women were murdered and nine other people were injured before Sodini killed himself [173] [174] He purportedly expressed sexual frustration and complained of constant rejections by women on a website registered in his name [175] Sodini and his actions have been embraced and glorified by some members of incel communities, who sometimes refer to incel violence as \"going Sodini\" [117] [176]\n\n\n2010s\nElliot Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen others before killing himself in Isla Vista, California on May 23, 2014, near the campus of University of California, Santa Barbara These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and YouTube videos in which he detailed his involuntary celibacy and discussed how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women [36] [177] [178] [117] He had been an active member of a community popular among incels called PUAHate (short for \"pickup artist hate\"), and referenced it several times in his manifesto [117] [179] [180] [181] Although PUAHate shut down soon after the attack, Rodger became something of a martyr to some communities that remained, and to some of those that emerged later [27] [47] [182] It is common to see references to \"E.R.\" in incel forums, and mass violence by incels is regularly referred to as \"going E.R.\" [112] [40] Rodger has been referenced by the perpetrators or suspected perpetrators of several other mass killings, and is one of several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities [114] [117]\n\n\n2020s\nOn February 24, 2020, a female spa worker was stabbed to death in an attack that also severely injured her female coworker at an erotic massage parlor in Toronto On May 19, the Toronto Police Service declared the attack was being treated as a terrorist incident after evidence pointed to the stabbings being motivated by incel ideology, and police laid charges against a 17-year-old male alleged to have committed the stabbings This was the first time violence thought to be motivated by incel ideologies was prosecuted as an act of terrorism, and is also believed to be the first act of violence not perpetrated by an Islamist extremist to be prosecuted as terrorism in Canada [66] On September 14, 2022, the perpetrator entered a guilty plea to murder and attempted murder [204] [205] [206] The attack was ruled a terrorist attack during sentencing proceedings [207]\n\n\nCriticism\nIncel communities have been criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist [4] [5] [145] [110] [56] Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums \"play [s] a very large role\" in the radicalization of their members, and describes incel forums as having \"more violent rhetoric than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites\" [53] Journalist David Futrelle has described incel communities as \"violently misogynistic\", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups [53] [110] [56] [219] Psychologist and sex researcher James Cantor has described incels as \"a group of people who usually lack sufficient social skills and .. find themselves very frustrated\" He has said that in incel forums \"when they're surrounded by other people with similar frustrations, they kind of lose track of what typical discourse is, and they drive themselves into more and more extreme beliefs\" [220] Senior research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Amarnath Amarasingam, has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying \"under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence\" [12] Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of men in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders, and to online campaigns convincing people to join ISIL Speaking about their feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude \"can go as far as the justification of rape\" [48]\n\n\nOf the subculture\nIncel communities have been criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist [4] [5] [145] [110] [56] Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums \"play [s] a very large role\" in the radicalization of their members, and describes incel forums as having \"more violent rhetoric than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites\" [53] Journalist David

promote anorexia and other eating disorders, and to online campaigns convincing people to join ISIL Speaking about their feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude \"can go as far as the justification of rape\" [48]\n\n\nOf platforms providing services to incel communities\nCriticism has also been directed against platforms that host or have hosted incel content, including Reddit (which banned the r/incels community in 2017, and banned most of the remaining incel communities in September 2019, but is still home to some identifying as incels) and Twitter [56] [45] Cloudflare, which provides services including DDoS protection, caching and obsfucation of the source host of the content, [225] has also been criticized for protecting incel websites against downtime even when webhosts have terminated service [226]\n\n\nOf reporting and research\nReporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its \"breathless\" coverage, for normalizing incel communities by describing them only as \"sexually frustrated\", and for directing readers to incel communities [227] Some reporting has also been criticized for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length, or for victim blaming by implying that women who had rejected the attackers' romantic or sexual advances held some responsibility for provoking the attacks [228] [229] Those who have written sympathetically about incels have faced criticism for legitimizing the incel ideology, such as from Samantha Cole in Vice who condemned media outlets who \"cove [r] and amplif [y] toxic internet culture as if it's valid ideology\" [224]\n\n\nPortrayals in fiction\nIn his debut novel Whatever (1994), French writer Michel Houellebecq seems to portray early examples of incels However, the term did not yet exist at the time; neither did the online communities The unnamed, 30-year-old protagonist looks unattractive, lacks social skills and suffers from depression, which means that despite his excellent job as an IT professional, he is not popular with women Things are much worse for his colleague, who is downright ugly and still a virgin at 28 The main character tries to seduce his friend into killing a young woman who has rejected him, which his friend refuses at the last moment In this novel, the main protagonist philosophizes about the disastrous consequences of the sexual revolution Because of sexual liberalism, the market mechanism has come to determine human relationships As a consequence, beautiful people get everything, ugly people get nothing [230] [231] [232]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "content": "\nEarly life, family, and education\nCharles was born at 21:14 (GMT) on 14 November 1948, [3] during the reign of his maternal grandfather, King George VI, as the first child of Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh [4] He was delivered by Caesarean section at Buckingham Palace [5] His parents had three more children, Anne (born 1950), Andrew (born 1960) and Edward (born 1964) He was christened Charles Philip Arthur George on 15 December 1948 in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher [e] [f] [9] [10]\n\n\nPrince of Wales\nCharles was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 26 July 1958, [29] though his investiture was not held until 1 July 1969, when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at Caernarfon Castle; [30] the investiture was controversial in Wales owing to growing Welsh nationalist sentiment [31] He took his seat in the House of Lords the following year [32] and he delivered his maiden speech on 13 June 1974, [33] the first royal to speak from the floor since the future Edward VII in 1884 [34] He spoke again in 1975 [35]\n\n\nMilitary training and career\nCharles served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy During his second year at Cambridge, he received Royal Air Force training, learning to fly the Chipmunk aircraft with the Cambridge University Air Squadron, [40] [41] and was presented with his RAF wings in August 1971 [42]\n\n\nRelationships and marriages\nIn his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women His girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of Sir John Russell, who was the British ambassador to Spain; [46] Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington; [47] Davina Sheffield; [48] Lady Sarah Spencer; [49] and Camilla Shand, who later became his second wife [50]\n\n\nBachelorhood\nIn his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women His girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of Sir John Russell, who was the British ambassador to Spain;

he had stopped the use of foie gras at his own properties for more than a decade before becoming king [166] During a September 2023 state banquet at the Palace of Versailles, it was reported that he did not want foie gras or out-of-season asparagus on the menu Instead he was served lobster [167]\n\n\nCharity work\nSince founding the Prince's Trust in 1976, using his £7,500 of severance pay from the Navy, [168] Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations and now serves as president of each [169] [92] Together, they form a loose alliance, the Prince's Charities, which describes itself as \"the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over £100 million annually ..  [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise, and international\" [169] As Prince of Wales, Charles became patron or president of over 800 other charities and organisations [91]\n\n\nInvestigations of donations\nTwo of Charles's charities, the Prince's Foundation and the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund (later renamed the King's Foundation and King Charles III Charitable Fund, respectively), came under scrutiny in 2021 and 2022 for accepting donations the media deemed inappropriate In August 2021, it was announced that the Prince's Foundation was launching an investigation into the reports, [175] with Charles's support [176] The Charity Commission also launched an investigation into allegations that the donations meant for the Prince's Foundation had been instead sent to the Mahfouz Foundation [177] In February 2022, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours allegations linked to the foundation, [178] passing their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service for deliberation in October [179] In August 2023, the Metropolitan Police announced that they had concluded their investigations and no further actions would be taken [180]\n\n\nPersonal interests\nFrom young adulthood, Charles encouraged understanding of Indigenous voices, saying they held crucial messages about preservation of the land, respecting community and shared values, resolving conflict, and recognising and making good on past iniquities [188] He dovetailed this view with his efforts against climate change, [189] as well as reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and his charitable work in Canada [190] [191] At CHOGM 2022, Charles, who was representing his mother, raised that reconciliation process as an example for dealing with the history of slavery in the British Empire, [192] for which he expressed his sorrow [193]\n\n\nBuilt environment\nCharles has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning; he fostered the advancement of New Classical architecture and asserted that he \"care [s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.\" [205] In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects in May 1984, he described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\" and deplored the \"glass stumps and concrete towers\" of modern architecture [206] Charles called for local community involvement in architectural choices and asked, \"why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles – and functional?\" [206] Charles has \"a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture\" and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, which combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles [207]\n\n\nNatural environment\nSince the 1970s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness [226] At the age of 21, he delivered his first speech on environmental issues in his capacity as the chairman of the Welsh Countryside Committee [227] An avid gardener, Charles has also emphasised the importance of talking to plants, stating that \"I happily talk to the plants and trees, and listen to them I think it's absolutely crucial\" [228] His interest in gardening began in 1980 when he took over the Highgrove estate [229] His \"healing garden\", based on sacred geometry and ancient religious symbolism, went on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2002 [229]\n\n\nAlternative medicine\nCharles has controversially championed alternative medicine, including homeopathy [243] [244] He first publicly expressed his interest in the topic in December 1982, in an address to the British Medical Association [245] [246] This speech was seen as \"combative\" and \"critical\" of modern medicine and was met with anger by some medical professionals [244] Similarly, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) attracted opposition from the scientific and medical community over its campaign encouraging general practitioners to offer herbal and other alternative treatments to NHS patients [247] [248]\n\n\nSports\nFrom his youth until 2005, Charles was an avid player of competitive polo [257] Charles also frequently took part in fox hunting until the sport was banned in the United Kingdom, also in 2005 [258] By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a \"political statement\" by those who were opposed to it [259] Charles suffered several polo and hunting-related injuries throughout the years, including a two-inch scar on his left cheek in 1980, a broken arm in 1990, a torn cartilage in his left knee in 1992, a broken rib in 1998, and a fractured shoulder in 2001 [153]\n\n\nVisual, performing, and literary arts\nCharles has been involved in performance since his youth, and appeared in sketches and revues while studying at Cambridge [264]\n\n\nReligion and philosophy\nShortly after his accession to the throne, Charles publicly described himself as \"a committed Anglican Christian\"; [275] at age 16, during Easter 1965, he had been confirmed into the Anglican Communion by Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle [276] The King is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England [277] and a member of the Church of Scotland; he swore an oath to uphold that church immediately after he was proclaimed king [278] He attends services at various Anglican churches close to Highgrove [279] and attends the Church of Scotland's Crathie Kirk with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle.\n\n\nMedia image and public opinion\nSince his birth, Charles has received close media attention, which increased as he matured It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and their aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king [294]\n\n\nReaction to press treatment\nIn 1994 German tabloid Bild published nude photos of Charles that were taken while he was vacationing in Le Barroux; they had reportedly been put up for sale for £30,000 [305] Buckingham Palace reacted by stating that it was \"unjustifiable for anybody to suffer this sort of intrusion\" [306]\n\n\nResidences and finance\n\nIn 2023, The Guardian estimated Charles's personal wealth at £1.8 billion [311] This estimate includes the assets of the Duchy of Lancaster worth £653 million (and paying Charles an annual income of £20 million), jewels worth £533 million, real estate worth £330 million, shares and investments worth £142 million, a stamp collection worth at least £100 million, racehorses worth £27 million, artworks worth £24 million, and cars worth £6.3 million [311] Most of this wealth which he inherited from his mother was exempt from inheritance tax [311] [312]\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nCharles has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is sovereign of many orders in his own countries and has received honours and awards from around the world [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] In each of his realms, he has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: King of Saint Lucia and of His other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, he is known as Lord of Mann Charles is also styled Defender of the Faith.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nCharles has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is sovereign of many orders in his own countries and has received honours and awards from around the world [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] In each of his realms, he has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: King of Saint Lucia and of His other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, he is known as Lord of Mann Charles is also styled Defender of the Faith.\n\n\nArms\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles's coat of arms was based on the arms of the United Kingdom, differenced with a white label and an inescutcheon of the Principality of Wales, surmounted by the heir apparent's crown, and with the motto Ich dien (German:  [ɪç ˈdiːn], \"I serve\") instead of Dieu et mon droit.\n\n\nBanners, flags, and standards\nThe banners used by Charles as Prince of Wales varied depending upon location His personal standard for the United Kingdom was the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms, with a label of three points argent and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre It was used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when Charles was acting in an official capacity associated with the British Armed Forces [340]\n\n\nAs heir apparent\nThe banners used by Charles as Prince of Wales varied depending upon location His personal standard for the United Kingdom was the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms, with a label of three points argent and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre It was used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when Charles was acting in an official capacity associated with the British Armed Forces [340]\n\n\nAs sovereign\nThe royal standard of the United Kingdom is used to represent the King in the United Kingdom and on official visits overseas, except in Australia and Canada It is the royal arms in banner form undifferentiated, having been used by successive British monarchs since 1702 The royal standard of Canada is used by the King in Canada and while acting on behalf of Canada overseas It is the escutcheon of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada in banner form undifferentiated.\n\n\nIssue\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nAncestry\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nSee also\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nNotes\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nReferences\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nCitations\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nBibliography\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nFurther reading\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nExternal links\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
