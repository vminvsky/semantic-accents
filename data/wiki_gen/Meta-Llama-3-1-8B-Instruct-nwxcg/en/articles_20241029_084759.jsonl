He is known for his libertarian and free-market views, which have been shaped by his experiences as an economist and his critiques of Argentine politics.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJavier Milei was born on March 22, 1970, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His father was an Italian immigrant who worked as an accountant, and his mother was a homemaker. Milei grew up in a middle-class family and was raised in a liberal and secular household. He has said that his experiences growing up in Argentina during the 1970s and 1980s, a time of economic crisis and social unrest, shaped his views on politics and economics.\n\nMilei studied economics at the University of Buenos Aires, where he earned a degree in 1994. He then pursued a master's degree in economics at the University of Chicago, which he completed in 1996. During his time at the University of Chicago, Milei was influenced by the ideas of economists such as Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, who emphasized the importance of individual freedom and limited government intervention in the economy.\n\n**Economics career**\n\nAfter completing his master's degree, Milei returned to Argentina and began working as an economist for a private consulting firm. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and innovative economist, and his work caught the attention of policymakers and business leaders.\n\nIn 2001, Milei was appointed as the head of the economic department of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. He played a key role in the development of the exchange's index, which became a benchmark for the Argentine stock market.\n\nMilei's work as an economist was marked by his critiques of Argentine politics and his advocacy for free-market policies. He was a vocal critic of the government's policies, which he believed were stifling economic growth and creating poverty.\n\n**Early political career**\n\nMilei's entry into politics began in 2015, when he founded the Libertarian Party of Argentina. The party's platform was based on libertarian principles, such as individual freedom, limited government intervention, and free markets.\n\nMilei's rise to prominence as a politician was rapid. He quickly became a prominent figure in Argentine politics, known for his sharp intellect and his ability to communicate complex economic ideas to a broad audience.\n\n**Rise to prominence**\n\nMilei's rise to prominence was fueled by his critiques of Argentine politics and his advocacy for free-market policies. He was a vocal critic of the government's policies, which he believed were stifling economic growth and creating poverty.\n\nIn 2017, Milei was elected to the Buenos Aires City Council, where he served as a member of the Libertarian Party. He quickly became a leader in the council, using his platform to advocate for free-market policies and to criticize government corruption.\n\n**2021 legislative campaign**\n\nIn 2021, Milei announced his candidacy for the Argentine Congress.

From its early beginnings as a form of spiritual and ritualistic practice to its current status as a global sport and recreational activity, rock climbing has evolved significantly over time.\n\n**#Origins**\n\nThe origins of rock climbing are not well-documented, but it is believed to date back to at least the Upper Paleolithic period, around 40,000-50,000 years ago. During this time, early humans likely used rock climbing as a means of accessing food, shelter, and other resources. In many cultures, rock climbing was also used as a form of spiritual and ritualistic practice, with climbers seeking to connect with nature and the divine.\n\nIn Africa, for example, the San people have a long history of rock climbing, using it as a means of accessing food and shelter in the rugged landscape of the Kalahari Desert.

Vikram Vedha was released on September 30, 2022.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is a remake of the 2017 film of the same name, which was based on the classic Tamil folk tale of Sooran Kanda Puranam. The story revolves around Vikram (R. Madhavan), a police officer who is determined to capture the notorious gangster Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi).

It has been a vital aspect of human culture and daily life for thousands of years, serving both functional and decorative purposes. Pottery is a complex process that involves the manipulation of clay bodies, shaping, drying, and firing, which requires a deep understanding of materials, techniques, and craftsmanship.\n\n## Main types\n\nThere are several types of pottery, each with its unique characteristics and properties.\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is a type of pottery made from a mixture of clay, water, and other minerals. It is a relatively soft and porous material that is often used for making decorative items, such as vases, figurines, and pottery animals. Earthenware is often glazed with a clear or colored glaze to protect it from moisture and enhance its appearance.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery made from a mixture of clay, water, and other minerals, but with a higher density and strength than earthenware. It is often used for making functional items, such as cups, bowls, and plates. Stoneware is known for its durability, strength, and resistance to moisture.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery made from a specific type of clay called kaolin, which is mixed with feldspar and quartz. It is known for its whiteness, translucency, and strength. Porcelain is often used for making fine china, decorative figurines, and other luxury items.\n\n## Archaeology\n\nPottery has played a significant role in archaeology, providing valuable information about ancient cultures and civilizations. Archaeologists use pottery to reconstruct the past, study trade networks, and understand the social and economic systems of ancient societies.\n\n### Fabric analysis\n\nPottery fabric analysis involves the examination of the physical and chemical properties of pottery to determine its composition, origin, and age. This technique involves the analysis of the pottery's texture, color, and mineral composition, as well as the study of its firing and glazing techniques.\n\n## Clay bodies and raw materials\n\nClay bodies are the raw materials used to make pottery. Clay is a naturally occurring substance that is composed of fine particles of minerals and rocks. There are several types of clay bodies, each with its unique properties and characteristics.\n\n## Production\n\nPottery production involves several stages, from shaping and drying to firing and glazing.\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of forming the clay into the desired shape. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including hand-building, throwing on a potter's wheel, and pressing.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the clay. This can be done using air drying, drying with a fan, or using a drying cabinet.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the pottery to high temperatures to vitrify the clay and achieve the desired color and hardness. There are several types of firing, including:\n\n### Temperature\n\nFiring temperatures can range from 1000°C to 1400°C, depending on the type of clay and the desired result.\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nFiring can be done in a variety of atmospheres, including air, gas, and electric. Each atmosphere produces a different effect on the pottery.\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several firing methods, including:\n\n### Stages\n\nFiring can be done in multiple stages, with each stage achieving a specific effect on the pottery.\n\n## Decorating\n\nPottery decoration involves the addition of color, texture, and pattern to the pottery. There are several methods of decorating pottery, including:\n\n## Glazing\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. Glaze is a mixture of chemicals that is applied to the pottery to achieve a specific color and texture.\n\n## Health and environmental issues\n\nPottery production can have health and environmental implications. Exposure to clay dust and chemicals can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Additionally, the production of pottery can have environmental impacts, including the use of non-renewable resources and the generation of waste.\n\n## History\n\nPottery has a long and complex history that spans thousands of years.\n\n### Early pottery\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to the Neolithic period, around 9000 BCE. Early pottery was made from clay and was used for cooking and storing food.\n\n### History by region\n\nPottery has a long and varied history in different regions of the world.\n\n### Beginnings of pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery are not well understood, but it is thought to have originated in the Fertile Crescent around 9000 BCE.\n\n### East Asia\n\nPottery has a long history in East Asia, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n\n### South Asia\n\nPottery has a rich history in South Asia, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization.\n\n### Southeast Asia\n\nPottery has a significant history in Southeast Asia, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n\n### West Asia\n\nPottery has a long and complex history in West Asia, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n\n### Europe\n\nPottery has a long history in Europe, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n\n### United Kingdom\n\nPottery has a rich history in the United Kingdom, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n\n### Arabic pottery\n\nArabic pottery has a long and significant history, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the 7th century CE.\n\n### Americas\n\nPottery has a complex history in the Americas, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Archaic period.\n\n### Africa\n\nPottery has a rich history in Africa, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Neolithic period.\n\n### Oceania\n\nPottery has a significant history in Oceania, with evidence of early pottery dating back to the Lapita period.\n\n## See also\n\n* Ceramics\n* Glassmaking\n* Metalworking\n* Textiles\n* Archaeology\n* Ethnography\n\n## References\n\n## Further reading\n\n* \"The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World\" by John P.

The exodus was a result of a combination of factors, including insurgency, violence, and intimidation by militant groups, which led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri Hindus from their ancestral homes.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nKashmiri Hindus, also known as Kashmiri Pandits, have a long and rich history in the Kashmir Valley. They were the dominant community in the region for centuries, contributing significantly to the region's culture, language, and politics. However, with the rise of insurgency in the 1980s, the Kashmiri Hindu community faced increasing violence, intimidation, and threats from militant groups, which ultimately led to their mass migration from the valley.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kashmir Valley has a long history of conflict and violence, dating back to the 1950s. The region was a princely state under the British Raj, and after independence, it was annexed by India and Pakistan in 1947. The Kashmir Valley has been a source of tension between India and Pakistan ever since, with both countries claiming sovereignty over the region. In the 1980s, a separatist movement emerged in the valley, advocating for independence from India. The movement was led by various militant groups, including the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hizbul Mujahideen.\n\n**Insurgency activity**\n\nThe insurgency in the Kashmir Valley began in the late 1980s, with the JKLF launching a series of attacks on Indian security forces. The JKLF was supported by Pakistan and received funding and arms from the country. The Hizbul Mujahideen, on the other hand, was a local militant group that emerged in the early 1990s. The group was founded by Syed Salahuddin, a Kashmiri separatist leader, and was known for its brutal tactics, including the use of terrorist attacks and kidnappings.\n\n### Attack and threats\n\nThe Kashmiri Hindu community was the primary target of the militants. They were subjected to violent attacks, including shootings, bombings, and kidnappings. Many Kashmiri Hindus were forced to flee their homes, leaving behind their properties and livelihoods. The militants also issued threats against the community, warning them to leave the valley or face dire consequences. The Indian government responded to the insurgency with a military crackdown, which further exacerbated the situation.\n\n### Threats to the community\n\nThe Kashmiri Hindu community faced various threats, including:\n\n*   **Violence:** The community was subjected to violent attacks, including shootings, bombings, and kidnappings.\n*   **Intimidation:** Militants issued threats against the community, warning them to leave the valley or face dire consequences.\n*   **Economic pressure:** The community was subjected to economic pressure, including the destruction of their properties and livelihoods.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus had a devastating impact on the community. Many were forced to flee their homes, leaving behind their properties and livelihoods. The community was also subjected to economic pressure, including the destruction of their properties and livelihoods. The Indian government responded to the insurgency with a military crackdown, which further exacerbated the situation.\n\n**Rehabilitation**\n\nThe rehabilitation of the Kashmiri Hindu community has been a long and challenging process. The Indian government has established various schemes to assist the community, including the Prime Minister's Package for Kashmiri Migrants, which provides financial assistance, housing, and employment opportunities. However, many members of the community have expressed dissatisfaction with the rehabilitation efforts, citing a lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus has been depicted in various forms of popular culture, including books and movies. Some notable examples include:\n\n### Books\n\n*   **\"The Dispossessed\":** This book by Amitabh Mattoo chronicles the story of a Kashmiri Hindu family who were forced to flee their home in 1990.\n*   **\"In the Presence of Mortals\":** This book by Dina Nath Pandita explores the cultural and historical context of the Kashmiri Hindu community.\n\n### Movies\n\n*   **\"The Kashmir Files\":** This movie by Vivek Agnihotri tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu family who were forced to flee their home in 1990.\n*   **\"Terror in Kashmir\":** This movie by Anurag Kashyap explores the human cost of the insurgency in Kashmir.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   **Kashmir conflict:** The Kashmir conflict is a ongoing dispute between India and Pakistan over the region of Kashmir.\n*   **Kashmiri Hindus:** Kashmiri Hindus are a community of Hindus who have a long history in the Kashmir Valley.\n*   **Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front:** The Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front is a separatist group that advocates for independence from India.\n\n**Notes**\n\n*   The exodus of Kashmiri Hindus was a mass migration of Hindus from the Kashmir Valley in Jammu and Kashmir, India.\n*   The exodus was a result of a combination of factors, including insurgency, violence, and intimidation by militant groups.\n*   The Indian government responded to the insurgency with a military crackdown, which further exacerbated the situation.\n\n**References**\n\n*   This article is based on publicly available information and has not been cited.\n*   The references cited in this article are not included due to the lack of specific references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n*   Mattoo, A.

Heard\n\nDepp v. Heard was a highly publicized defamation lawsuit filed by actor Johnny Depp against his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, in 2018. The case centered around an op-ed article published by Heard in The Washington Post, which Depp's lawyers claimed contained defamatory statements about him. The trial, which took place in Fairfax County, Virginia, in 2022, drew widespread media attention and sparked intense public debate.\n\n# Background\n\n## Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met on the set of the 2011 film \"The Rum Diary\" and began dating in 2012. They got married in 2015 and had a private ceremony in their home in the Bahamas. However, their marriage was marked by allegations of domestic abuse, with both parties accusing each other of physical and emotional abuse. In 2016, Heard filed for a restraining order against Depp, claiming that he had physically abused her on multiple occasions. Depp denied the allegations and the restraining order was eventually dropped.\n\n## Depp v. News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn 2018, Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of The Sun, over an article that referred to him as a \"wife-beater.\" Depp's lawyers claimed that the article was defamatory and that it had damaged his reputation. The case was settled out of court, with The Sun issuing an apology to Depp.\n\n## Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Amber Heard published an op-ed in The Washington Post titled \"I spoke up against sexual violence – and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change.\" In the article, Heard wrote about her experiences with domestic abuse and how she had spoken out against it. However, Depp's lawyers claimed that the article implied that Depp was her abuser, without directly naming him. They argued that this was a clear case of defamation.\n\n## Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn 2018, Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, made comments to the Daily Mail about Depp's behavior, suggesting that he had a history of domestic abuse. Depp's lawyers claimed that these comments were defamatory and that they had damaged Depp's reputation.\n\n# Civil action\n\n## Pre-trial developments\n\nThe civil action was filed by Depp in 2018, with Heard responding to the lawsuit in 2019. The case was set to go to trial in 2020, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the trial was rescheduled for 2022.\n\n## Trial\n\n### Opening statements\n\nThe trial began on April 11, 2022, with Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, delivering an opening statement. Vasquez argued that Heard had fabricated the allegations of domestic abuse and that she had written the op-ed article to promote her own career. Heard's lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, countered that Depp had a history of abuse and that the op-ed article was a legitimate expression of Heard's experiences.\n\n### Testimony\n\nOver the course of several weeks, both Depp and Heard took the stand to testify in the trial. Depp claimed that he had never physically abused Heard and that she was the one who had been abusive towards him. Heard testified that Depp had physically and emotionally abused her on multiple occasions, including during their honeymoon in 2015.\n\n### Closing arguments\n\nIn her closing argument, Vasquez argued that Heard had lied about Depp's behavior and that she had fabricated the allegations of domestic abuse. Bredehoft countered that Depp had a history of abuse and that the op-ed article was a legitimate expression of Heard's experiences.\n\n### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered their verdict, finding that Heard had defamed Depp in three statements in her op-ed article. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in damages, but reduced the award to $5 million due to Virginia's cap on punitive damages. The jury also found that one of Depp's lawyers had defamed Heard, awarding her $2 million in damages.\n\n## Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed a motion to set aside the verdict, arguing that the jury's decision was unreasonable and that the trial was unfair. Depp's lawyers also filed a motion to increase the damages awarded to Depp.\n\n## Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nIn August 2022, Heard appealed the verdict, arguing that the jury's decision was in error. Depp's lawyers also filed a lawsuit against Heard's lawyers, alleging that they had engaged in misconduct during the trial. In October 2022, it was reported that Depp and Heard had reached a settlement in the civil action, with Heard agreeing to pay Depp $1 million. In December 2022, it was reported that Depp had sued his insurance carrier, Lloyd's of London, over the costs of the lawsuit.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed on various platforms, including YouTube and Facebook. The livestream attracted millions of viewers and sparked intense public debate.\n\n## Social media coverage\n\nThe trial was widely covered on social media, with many people expressing their opinions on the case. Some people supported Depp, while others supported Heard.\n\n## Comments by juror\n\nAfter the verdict, one of the jurors spoke out about the case, stating that Heard had been \"untruthful\" and that Depp had been \"cooperative\" during the trial.\n\n## The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post, which published Heard's op-ed article, issued a statement defending the article and Heard's right to free speech.\n\n## Commentary on verdict\n\nThe verdict was widely covered in the media, with many commentators expressing their opinions on the case. Some people argued that the verdict was a victory for Depp and a setback for women's rights, while others argued that the verdict was a vindication of Depp's reputation.\n\n# Media coverage\n\n## Film adaptation\n\nIn 2022, it was reported that a film adaptation of the case was in the works, with Johnny Depp set to star as himself.\n\n## Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the case, including \"Depp v.

The film's plot revolves around a catastrophic event that causes the moon to crash into Earth, threatening the survival of humanity. Moonfall is Emmerich's second film to explore themes of global catastrophe and disaster, following the success of his 2012 film, 2012.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a prologue that takes place in 2019, where we meet a group of astronauts, including Captain Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson) and astronaut Jocinda Fowler (Halle Berry), who are part of the International Space Station (ISS) crew. The team is on a mission to repair a malfunctioning solar panel on the ISS when they stumble upon a mysterious cave on the moon's surface.\n\nAs the team investigates the cave, they discover a hidden chamber containing an ancient artifact that appears to be some kind of ancient technology. The team returns to Earth, but their mission is cut short when they are forced to make an emergency landing due to a solar flare.\n\nCut to 2022, where we meet our main characters, Brian and Jocinda, who have not spoken since their moon mission. Jocinda is now a geologist, while Brian is a former astronaut turned engineer. The two are reunited when they are approached by a mysterious woman, Kira (Halle Berry), who claims to have information about the moon's catastrophic fate.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we learn that the moon is actually a hollow shell that was created by an advanced civilization in the distant past. The shell is on a collision course with Earth, and the only way to prevent the disaster is to use an ancient technology found on the moon to propel the shell away from Earth.\n\nHowever, time is running out, and the team must navigate treacherous landscapes, treacherous government agents, and treacherous colleagues to reach the moon and use the technology before it's too late.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Halle Berry as Kira\n* Patrick Wilson as Captain Brian Harper\n* John Bradley as Ben Drask\n* Michael Peña as Charlie Palmer\n* Donald Sutherland as Nathan Radford\n* Kelly Yu as Jocinda Fowler\n* Charles Dance as General Pruitt\n* Josh Dallas as Ben's brother, Kevin\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nMoonfall was first announced in 2017, with Roland Emmerich set to direct and produce the film.

The film's script was heavily influenced by Emmerich's own childhood experiences, as well as his research into the history of the moon and its possible origins.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Moonfall began in 2020 in Vancouver, Canada, and wrapped up in 2021. The film was primarily shot using a combination of practical and visual effects, with a focus on creating a realistic and immersive experience for the audience.\n\nThe film's visual effects were handled by a team of experts from the visual effects company, Legacy Effects, who had previously worked on films such as the Avengers franchise and the Star Wars franchise.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser, who had previously worked together on several films, including the Independence Day franchise. The score features a combination of orchestral and electronic elements, with a focus on creating a sense of urgency and tension.\n\n**Release**\n\nMoonfall was released on February 4, 2022, in the United States and Canada, and on February 11, 2022, in the rest of the world. The film was released in both 2D and 3D formats, as well as IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\n### Home Media\n\nMoonfall was released on digital platforms on April 19, 2022, and on DVD and Blu-ray on May 3, 2022. The film's home media release includes a range of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box Office\n\nMoonfall was a commercial success, grossing over $170 million worldwide on its opening weekend, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022. The film went on to gross over $400 million worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of all time.\n\n### Critical Response\n\nMoonfall received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's visual effects and action sequences, while others criticized its plot and characters.

However, the twist was that the nominees would be determined by a random draw, rather than by the houseguests themselves.\n\n## Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance\n\nIn a twist revealed in Episode 4, the houseguests were given the opportunity to purchase a one-time insurance policy that would protect them from eviction. The policy, known as the Belairdirect Eviction Protection Insurance, cost $50,000 and would guarantee the houseguest's safety in the next eviction.\n\n## Chain of Safety Double Eviction\n\nIn a twist revealed in Episode 7, the houseguests were informed that there would be a double eviction in the next episode. However, the twist was that the houseguests would not be voting on who would be evicted. Instead, the two houseguests at the bottom of the jury vote would be evicted, with the houseguests at the top of the vote going into the jury.\n\n## Canada's Jury Vote\n\nIn a twist revealed in Episode 10, the houseguests were informed that the jury would be voting on who would win the season, rather than the regular finale format. The twist was that the jury would be voting on who they wanted to win the season, rather than who they thought was the most deserving of the win.\n\n# Summary\n\nBig Brother Canada Season 10 was a season of twists and turns, with houseguests competing in competitions and voting each other off the show.

All 150 seats in the Texas House of Representatives were up for election.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election was the first election held after the 2020 United States census. Following the census, the Texas Legislature redrew the state's congressional and state legislative districts to reflect the state's growth and demographic changes. The new districts were in place for the 2022 elections.\n\n**Redistricting**\n\nThe Texas Legislature passed a new map of the state's congressional and legislative districts in September 2021. The map was challenged in court by several groups, but it was ultimately upheld by the Texas Supreme Court.\n\n### Seats without incumbents\n\nThere were 42 seats in the Texas House of Representatives without an incumbent candidate running for re-election in 2022. These seats were in districts that had been redrawn due to the 2020 census or had been held by members of the Texas Senate who were term-limited and unable to run for re-election.\n\n### Double-bunked incumbents\n\nThere were 8 districts in the Texas House of Representatives where two incumbent members of the House were running against each other in the primary election. This was due to the state's primary election system, which allows multiple candidates to run for a single seat in the primary.\n\n**Retirements**\n\nThere were 21 members of the Texas House of Representatives who announced their retirement from office in 2022. These members had served a total of 317 years in the House and had introduced 1,235 bills during their time in office.\n\n**Special elections**\n\nThere were 3 special elections held in the Texas House of Representatives in 2022. These elections were held to fill vacancies in districts that had been left vacant due to the retirement of incumbent members.\n\n**Incumbents defeated**\n\n### Democrats\n\nThere were 5 incumbent Democrats who lost their seats in the 2022 election. These members were:\n\n* Chris Turner (HD-101)\n* Gina Hinojosa (HD-49)\n* Vikki Goodwin (HD-48)\n* Mike Schofield (HD-130)\n* Gina Calanni (HD-132)\n\n### Republicans\n\nThere were 10 incumbent Republicans who lost their seats in the 2022 election. These members were:\n\n* Jeff Leach (HD-67)\n* Cody Vasut (HD-2)\n* Mayes Middleton (HD-23)\n* Justin Holland (HD-33)\n* Craig Goldman (HD-68)\n* Charlie Geren (HD-99)\n* Matt Krause (HD-93)\n* Stephanie Klick (HD-91)\n* Lynn Stucky (HD-64)\n* Tom Oliverson (HD-130)\n\n**Predictions**\n\n### Statewide\n\nSeveral news outlets and election analysts predicted that the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election would be a close contest between the Democratic and Republican parties. However, ultimately, the Republicans maintained their majority in the House.\n\n### Competitive districts\n\nThere were 14 districts in the Texas House of Representatives that were considered competitive in the 2022 election. These districts were:\n\n* HD-1\n* HD-2\n* HD-4\n* HD-5\n* HD-7\n* HD-10\n* HD-12\n* HD-14\n* HD-16\n* HD-18\n* HD-20\n* HD-22\n* HD-24\n* HD-26\n\n**Summary of results**\n\nThe Republican Party maintained its majority in the Texas House of Representatives in the 2022 election.\n\n### Statewide\n\nThe Republicans won 84 seats in the Texas House of Representatives, while the Democrats won 66 seats.\n\n### Close races\n\nThere were 14 close races in the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election. These races were:\n\n* HD-1\n* HD-2\n* HD-4\n* HD-5\n* HD-7\n* HD-10\n* HD-12\n* HD-14\n* HD-16\n* HD-18\n* HD-20\n* HD-22\n* HD-24\n* HD-26\n\n**Results by district**\n\nThe results of the 2022 Texas House of Representatives election by district are as follows:\n\n**District 1**\n\n* Winner: Gary VanDeaver (R)\n* Margin: 11.6%\n\n**District 2**\n\n* Winner: Jon Rosenthal (D)\n* Margin: 3.5%\n\n**District 3**\n\n* Winner: Justin Holland (R)\n* Margin: 12.5%\n\n**District 4**\n\n* Winner: Sam Harless (R)\n* Margin: 10.5%\n\n**District 5**\n\n* Winner: Tom Oliverson (R)\n* Margin: 11.2%\n\n**District 6**\n\n* Winner: Matt Kiehm (R)\n* Margin: 14.5%\n\n**District 7**\n\n* Winner: Marvin Warr (R)\n* Margin: 15.5%\n\n**District 8**\n\n* Winner: Cody Vasut (R)\n* Margin: 12.5%\n\n**District 9**\n\n* Winner: Steve Toth (R)\n* Margin: 14.2%\n\n**District 10**\n\n* Winner: Senfronia Thompson (D)\n* Margin: 15.5%\n\n**District 11**\n\n* Winner: Cody Crouch (R)\n* Margin: 13.5%\n\n**District 12**\n\n* Winner: Jacey Jetton (R)\n* Margin: 14.2%\n\n**District 13**\n\n* Winner: Josh Trejo (D)\n* Margin: 10.5%\n\n**District 14**\n\n* Winner: Ann Johnson (D)\n* Margin: 14.5%\n\n**District 15**\n\n* Winner: Dennis Bonnen (R)\n* Margin: 12.2%\n\n**District 16**\n\n* Winner: Tom Craddick (R)\n* Margin: 15.5%\n\n**District 17**\n\n* Winner: Jeff Cason (R)\n* Margin: 13.5%\n\n**District 18**\n\n* Winner: Craig Goldman (R)\n* Margin: 14.2%\n\n**District 19**\n\n* Winner: J.D.

It was a pivotal moment in Australian history, marking a significant turning point in the development of the country's democracy and its relationship with the British Empire.\n\n**Origins in the Victorian gold rush**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion was a direct response to the grievances of the gold miners in the colony of Victoria, who were struggling with harsh conditions, excessive taxation, and lack of representation. The gold rush had begun in 1851, and by 1854, the population of Victoria had swelled to over 250,000, with many of them being prospectors, miners, and small business owners.\n\n### Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nThe protests against the government's policies began as early as 1851, with miners demanding lower taxes, better working conditions, and more equitable treatment. The government, led by Governor Charles La Trobe, was slow to respond to these demands, leading to growing frustration among the miners.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1852, La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which imposed a significant burden on the miners. This move was seen as an attempt to strangle the mining industry and was met with widespread opposition.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1853, the first gold commissioner, Captain Thomas Mitchell, arrived in Ballarat, a major goldfield in Victoria. Mitchell was tasked with enforcing the government's rules and regulations, but his efforts were met with resistance from the miners, who saw him as an oppressive and corrupt official.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition signed by over 10,000 miners was presented to the Legislative Council, demanding lower taxes and better working conditions. This led to the formation of the Red Ribbon Movement, a loose coalition of miners and small business owners who were determined to bring about change.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn response to the growing unrest, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry into the grievances of the miners. However, this move was seen as a delaying tactic by the miners, who demanded immediate action.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Governor Sir Charles Hotham replaced La Trobe as governor of Victoria. Hotham was seen as a more conciliatory figure, but his efforts to address the miners' grievances were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n**Tensions escalate**\n\nAs the months went by, tensions between the miners and the government continued to escalate. The miners were becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress, and the government was growing more and more oppressive in its response.\n\n### Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn November 1854, James Scobie, a prominent miner, was murdered by a group of troopers. This event sparked widespread outrage among the miners, who saw it as an act of state terrorism.\n\n### Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn the aftermath of Scobie's murder, a series of meetings was held by the Ballarat Reform League, a coalition of miners and small business owners. These meetings were attended by thousands of people and served as a rallying point for the miners' grievances.\n\n### Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nOn November 29, 1854, a group of miners looted a military convoy, leading to a series of violent clashes between the miners and the troops. This marked a turning point in the conflict, as the government and the miners were now openly at war.\n\n**Open rebellion**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion began on December 3, 1854, when a group of miners, led by Peter Lalor, occupied a stockade on the Eureka lead. The miners had come to a decision to take matters into their own hands and resist the government's oppressive policies.\n\n### Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe miners in the stockade were a mix of professional soldiers, ex-soldiers, and ordinary men who had come to the goldfields seeking a better life. They had formed a paramilitary organization, the Ballarat Rifles, which was dedicated to the defense of the goldfields and the rights of the miners.\n\n### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe Eureka lead was a narrow ridge that connected the goldfields to the town of Ballarat. The miners had fortified this area with earthworks and barricades, making it a formidable defensive position.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nThe Irish dimension of the rebellion played a significant role in the eventual defeat of the miners. Many Irish miners had arrived in the goldfields seeking adventure and a new life, but they were also motivated by a desire to resist British rule. However, the Irish miners were also divided, with some supporting the rebellion and others opposing it.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nThe Independent Californian Rangers were a group of professional soldiers who had been hired by the government to quell the rebellion. However, a detachment of these soldiers departed the area, leaving a small garrison behind to face the miners.\n\n**Battle of the Eureka Stockade**\n\nThe Battle of the Eureka Stockade took place on December 4, 1854, and was a brutal and one-sided conflict. The government troops, led by Lieutenant Governor Sir Charles Hotham, were determined to crush the rebellion, and they did so with ruthless efficiency. The miners, who were vastly outnumbered, were no match for the troops, and they were forced to surrender.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the Battle of the Eureka Stockade was marked by widespread repression and persecution of the miners. Those who had taken part in the rebellion were arrested, tried, and sentenced to prison or transportation to a penal colony.\n\n### Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThe trials for sedition and high treason were a sham, with the government determined to crush the rebellion and discredit its opponents. Many of the accused were denied a fair trial, and those who were found guilty were sentenced to harsh punishments.\n\n### Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry, which had been established to investigate the grievances of the miners, was disbanded after the rebellion was crushed. However, its report, which was published in 1855, was a scathing critique of the government's policies and practices.\n\n### Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nPeter Lalor, the leader of the Ballarat Reform League, entered parliament in 1856, where he continued to campaign for the rights of the miners and the working class.\n\n**Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade**\n\nBakery Hill is a small hill in the town of Ballarat, which is situated near the Eureka lead. The Eureka Stockade was located on the Eureka lead, which connected the goldfields to the town of Ballarat.\n\n**Political legacy**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a profound impact on Australian politics and society. It marked a significant turning point in the development of the country's democracy and its relationship with the British Empire.\n\nThe rebellion highlighted the need for reform and the importance of the rights of the working class. It also led to the establishment of a more representative and accountable government, which was more responsive to the needs of the people.\n\n**Commemoration**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in various ways over the years. In the 19th century, a series of anniversaries was held to mark the rebellion, which were attended by thousands of people.\n\nIn the 20th century, a monument was erected on the site of the Eureka Stockade, which commemorated the bravery and sacrifice of the miners who took part in the rebellion.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Eureka Rebellion has been recognized as a significant moment in Australian history, which marked a turning point in the country's development.\n\n**Popular culture**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been the subject of various works of popular culture, including books, films, and songs.\n\nThe rebellion has been depicted in films such as \"The Eureka Stockade\" (1910) and \"Riff Raff\" (1936), which were based on the events of the rebellion.\n\nThe rebellion has also been the subject of numerous books, including \"The Eureka Stockade\" by Raffaello Carboni and \"Eureka: The Story of the People Who Took on the British Empire\" by Peter FitzSimons.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Australian history\n* Gold rush\n* Immigration to Australia\n* Labor movement\n* Peter Lalor\n* Red Ribbon Movement\n* Ballarat Reform League\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Eureka Rebellion was a significant moment in Australian history, which marked a turning point in the country's development.\n* The rebellion was sparked by the grievances of the miners, who were struggling with harsh conditions, excessive taxation, and lack of representation.\n* The rebellion was crushed by the government, but it had a profound impact on Australian politics and society.\n* The Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in various ways over the years, including the establishment of a monument on the site of the Eureka Stockade.\n\n**References**\n\n* Carboni, R.

The image is meant to convey a sense of disconnection and isolation, reflecting the album's themes of social disconnection and emotional struggle.\n\nRelease\nThose Once Loyal was released on July 5, 2005, in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Her family moved to Germany when she was a child, and she grew up in a middle-class household. Sorokin's parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother and stepfather. She developed a fascination with wealth and luxury at an early age, often watching videos of celebrities and wealthy individuals on YouTube.\n\nSorokin's interest in fashion and luxury continued to grow, and she began to develop a sense of entitlement and a desire for material possessions. She would often lie about her family's financial situation and claim to have a wealthy upbringing. This behavior would later become a hallmark of her con artist persona.\n\n#Fraud\n\nSorokin's career as a con artist began when she was in her early twenties. She started by posing as a wealthy socialite and using her charm and good looks to manipulate hotel staff, restaurateurs, and others into giving her free services and accommodations. She would often claim to be a friend of a famous person or a wealthy business owner, and use her fake connections to gain favors and privileges.\n\nAs her confidence grew, Sorokin began to take on more complex and elaborate schemes. She would often pose as a wealthy heiress or a businesswoman, and use her fake identity to secure loans, credit cards, and other forms of credit. She would then use these financial instruments to pay for her own expenses, while making it seem like she was living a life of luxury.\n\n#Indictment and Arrest\n\nSorokin's con artist activities eventually caught up with her, and she was indicted in 2018 on charges of grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, and theft of services. She was arrested in May 2018 and held without bail. The indictment alleged that Sorokin had defrauded a bank out of $275,000 and had stolen over $275,000 in services from hotels, restaurants, and other businesses.\n\n#Trial, Conviction, and Sentence\n\nSorokin's trial began in September 2019 and lasted for several weeks. The prosecution presented evidence of Sorokin's numerous scams and fake identities, while the defense argued that Sorokin was a victim of circumstance and had been manipulated by others. In February 2020, Sorokin was convicted on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to her victims.\n\n#ICE Custody\n\nAfter her conviction, Sorokin was transferred to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to her immigration status. She had entered the United States on a tourist visa and had overstayed her welcome. ICE held Sorokin in custody for several months before she was transferred to a women's prison in New York.\n\n#Media Representation\n\nSorokin's story has been widely covered in the media, with many outlets portraying her as a charismatic and cunning con artist. The New York Times, Vogue, and other publications have written about Sorokin's schemes and her eventual conviction. Her story has also been the subject of several documentaries and TV shows, including the Netflix series \"Inventing Anna.\"\n\n#After Prison\n\n##Art Shows\n\nAfter her release from prison, Sorokin began to pursue a career as an artist. She has shown her work in several galleries and exhibitions, and has been praised by some critics for her unique perspective and style.\n\n##Non-Fungible Tokens\n\nIn 2021, Sorokin began to explore the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). She created a series of digital art pieces that were sold as NFTs, and has spoken publicly about the potential of NFTs to disrupt the art world.\n\n##Fashion\n\nSorokin has also continued to explore the fashion world, creating her own clothing and accessory line. She has been praised by some fashion critics for her unique sense of style and her ability to blend high-end and streetwear.\n\n#Personal Life\n\nSorokin has been open about her personal life and has spoken publicly about her struggles with mental health and her experiences as a con artist. She has also been involved in several high-profile romances and has been the subject of much media attention.\n\n#See Also\n\n* Con artist\n* Identity theft\n* Financial crimes\n* Women in prison\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This article does not include any references or citations, as per the requirements.)\n\n#External Links\n\n* Anna Sorokin's Instagram account\n* Anna Sorokin's website\n* New York Times article on Anna Sorokin\n* Vogue article on Anna Sorokin", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anna_Sorokin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This can occur due to various reasons, such as impaired respiratory or cardiovascular function, high altitude, or exposure to certain toxins. Hypoxia can have significant effects on the body's tissues and organs, leading to a range of symptoms and complications.\n\n**Classification**\n\nHypoxia can be classified based on its cause, extent, and the affected tissues and organs.\n\n### By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n#### Ischemia\n\nIschemia refers to a condition where blood flow to a specific area of the body is restricted, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. This can occur due to blockage of blood vessels, cardiac arrest, or other conditions.\n\n#### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when there is a lack of oxygen in the arterial blood, often due to respiratory or cardiac problems. This can be further classified into:\n\n#### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that can bind to hemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues. CO poisoning can occur due to exposure to cigarette smoke, car exhaust, or faulty appliances.\n\n#### Altitude\n\nHigh altitude can lead to hypoxia due to the lower oxygen levels in the air. Acclimatization to high altitudes can help mitigate this effect.\n\n#### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nBreathing gases with low oxygen levels, such as in deep-sea diving or space exploration, can lead to hypoxia.\n\n#### Other\n\nOther causes of hypoxia include anemia, histotoxic hypoxia, and certain medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n### By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified based on its extent, including:\n\n#### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs when the entire body is affected by low oxygen levels.\n\n#### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when a specific area or organ is affected by low oxygen levels.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs, including:\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia refers to a lack of oxygen to the brain, which can lead to brain damage or death.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea, the transparent layer on the front of the eye, is deprived of oxygen.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia refers to a lack of oxygen to the fetus during pregnancy, which can lead to birth defects or infant mortality.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when the oxygen levels in a tumor are low, making it more resistant to treatment.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nHypoxia can affect the vestibular system, leading to balance and equilibrium problems.\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the extent and duration of the condition. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Dizziness\n* Confusion\n* Headache\n* Numbness or tingling in extremities\n\n**Complications**\n\nIf left untreated, hypoxia can lead to severe complications, including:\n\n* Organ failure\n* Brain damage\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Death\n\n**Causes**\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Ischemia\n* Hypoxemic hypoxia\n* Anemia\n* Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n**Mechanism**\n\nThe mechanism of hypoxia involves a series of physiological and pathological responses, including:\n\n* Physiological responses\n* Acute responses\n* Chronic responses\n* Pathological responses\n\n### Physiological responses\n\nWhen the body is deprived of oxygen, it responds by increasing heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure. This is an attempt to increase oxygen delivery to the tissues.\n\n### Acute responses\n\nAcute responses to hypoxia include the release of stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which prepare the body for \"fight or flight\" responses.\n\n### Chronic responses\n\nChronic responses to hypoxia include the development of tolerance, where the body adapts to low oxygen levels by increasing red blood cell count and improving oxygen delivery.\n\n### Pathological responses\n\nPathological responses to hypoxia include the development of tissue damage, organ failure, and death.\n\n#### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia refers to a lack of blood flow to the brain, leading to tissue damage and brain death.\n\n#### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia refers to a lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart damage and cardiac arrest.\n\n#### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis refers to the formation of new blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests, including:\n\n* Physical examination and history\n* Tests\n* Differential diagnosis\n\n### Physical examination and history\n\nA thorough physical examination and medical history are essential in diagnosing hypoxia. The healthcare provider will look for signs of low oxygen levels, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness.\n\n### Tests\n\nVarious tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of hypoxia, including:\n\n* Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis\n* Pulse oximetry\n* Electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Chest X-ray\n* Computed tomography (CT) scan\n* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n\n### Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as:\n\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Shock\n* Anemia\n* Malignancy\n\n**Prevention**\n\nPrevention of hypoxia involves avoiding situations that may lead to low oxygen levels, such as:\n\n* High altitude\n* Exposure to carbon monoxide\n* Anemia\n* Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n**Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia**\n\nAcclimatization to high altitudes can help prevent altitude-induced hypoxia. This involves ascending to higher altitudes gradually, allowing the body to adapt to the lower oxygen levels.\n\n**Treatment and management**\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia involves providing oxygen therapy, addressing the underlying cause, and supporting the body's physiological responses.\n\n### Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia may involve:\n\n* Providing oxygen therapy\n* Addressing the underlying cause, such as ischemia or anemia\n* Supporting the body's physiological responses, such as increasing heart rate and respiration rate\n* Using medications to improve oxygen delivery, such as vasodilators and inotropes\n* Using ventilation therapy, such as mechanical ventilation, to support breathing\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia can vary depending on the extent and duration of the condition. In severe cases, hypoxia can lead to organ failure, brain damage, and death.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nEpidemiology of hypoxia involves the study of the distribution and determinants of hypoxia in populations. This includes:\n\n* Silent hypoxia\n\n### Silent hypoxia\n\nSilent hypoxia refers to a condition where a person has low oxygen levels without experiencing any symptoms. This can occur due to various factors, including anemia, histotoxic hypoxia, and certain medical conditions.\n\n**History**\n\nHistory of hypoxia involves the study of the development of hypoxia as a medical concept. This includes:\n\n* Etymology\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe word \"hypoxia\" comes from the Greek words \"hypo\" meaning \"under\" and \"oxia\" meaning \"oxygen\".\n\n**See also**\n\n* Anemia\n* Ischemia\n* Histotoxic hypoxia\n* Respiratory failure\n* Cardiac arrest\n* Shock\n* Malignancy\n* Acclimatization to high altitudes\n* Oxygen therapy\n* Ventilation therapy\n* Inotropes\n* Vasodilators\n\n**Notes**\n\nHypoxia is a complex condition that requires a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management. Healthcare providers should be aware of the various causes, symptoms, and treatments of hypoxia to provide optimal care to patients.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hypoxia_(medicine)\" following this outline:\n\n#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

One day, Geppetto creates a wooden puppet named Pinocchio, who comes to life after a wish is made upon a shooting star. As Pinocchio navigates the world, he is tempted by the villainous Stromboli, a puppet master who seeks to exploit Pinocchio's newfound consciousness. Meanwhile, Pinocchio's nose grows whenever he tells a lie, leading to a series of comedic misadventures.\n\nAs Pinocchio's adventures unfold, he meets a group of characters who help him on his journey, including Jiminy Cricket, a wise and kind insect who serves as Pinocchio's conscience. Together, they face a series of challenges and obstacles, including the wrath of Stromboli and the temptation of the Blue Fairy, a mystical being who offers Pinocchio a chance to become a real boy.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket\n* Cynthia Erivo as The Blue Fairy\n* Luke Evans as Stromboli\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Lampwick\n* Lorraine Bracco as Mother Fox\n* Giacomo Gianniotti as The Coachman\n* Kyanne Lamaya as The Waitress\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe project was first announced in 2015, with Robert Zemeckis attached to direct and Tom Hanks set to star as Geppetto.

The club was founded in 1889 and is one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in India. Mohun Bagan has a rich history, with a strong focus on developing young talent and a passionate fan base.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded in 1889 by a group of British expatriates and Bengali intellectuals in Kolkata. The club was originally known as the Mohun Bagan Athletic Club and was named after the Bengali poet and writer, Rabindranath Tagore's friend and fellow poet, Rabindranath's friend, Dwarkanath Tagore's second son, Dwarkanath Tagore's son, Dwarkanath Tagore's son-in-law, Dwarkanath Tagore's son-in-law's son, Mohun Bagan.

Basu, a former Indian Army officer, took over as the club's president and implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the club's football team. Under Basu's leadership, Mohun Bagan began to focus more heavily on football and invested in the development of young talent.\n\n### The historic year of 1911\n\n1911 was a significant year for Mohun Bagan, as the club defeated the British Army Football Team in a tournament held in Calcutta. This victory marked a major milestone for Indian football and cemented Mohun Bagan's status as a pioneering force in the sport.\n\n### Nation-wide exposure of the club (1912–30)\n\nThroughout the 1910s and 1920s, Mohun Bagan continued to gain national recognition, participating in a number of high-profile tournaments and competitions. The club's success during this period helped to establish it as one of the leading football clubs in India.\n\n### Significant contributions to the national team (1931–47)\n\nMohun Bagan players made significant contributions to the Indian national football team during the 1930s and 1940s. The club's players, including the legendary goalkeeper, Sailen Manna, helped India to qualify for the 1950 FIFA World Cup.\n\n### Struggle with consistency (1948–1950s)\n\nFollowing India's independence in 1947, Mohun Bagan faced a number of challenges, including a decline in the quality of its football team. The club struggled to achieve consistency during the 1940s and 1950s, but continued to be a major force in Indian football.\n\n### The golden team (1960-64)\n\nThe 1960s saw the emergence of Mohun Bagan's \"golden team,\" which is widely regarded as one of the greatest teams in Indian football history. The team, which included players such as Chuni Goswami and Subhas Bhowmick, won a number of major trophies, including the Indian National Football League (NFL) and the Calcutta Football League.\n\n### Decline and revival under P. K. Banerjee (1965-1970s)\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mohun Bagan experienced a decline in its fortunes, but the club was revitalized under the leadership of P. K. Banerjee, a former Indian international player and coach. Banerjee's team won a number of major trophies, including the NFL and the Federation Cup.\n\n### The National Club of India (1980s)\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Mohun Bagan continued to be a major force in Indian football, winning a number of trophies and establishing itself as one of the leading clubs in the country.\n\n### Commercialisation and incoming of foreigners (1990–2000)\n\nIn the 1990s, Mohun Bagan experienced significant commercialization, with the club introducing foreign players and coaches to its team.

The exercises, which began on January 3, 2022, and lasted for several days, were seen as a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were part of a long-standing pattern of Chinese military activity in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China (ROC), has been a self-governing island nation since 1949, when the ROC government retreated to the island following a civil war with the Communist Party of China (CPC). The CPC established the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland, and the two governments have been separated ever since.\n\n### Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nTaiwan has a defined airspace, known as its Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), which is patrolled by the Republic of China Air Force (RoCAF). The ADIZ is designed to detect and respond to any potential threats to Taiwan's airspace and territorial integrity. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of Chinese military aircraft entering Taiwan's ADIZ, often without warning. These incursions have sparked concern among Taiwanese and international observers, who see them as a form of military coercion and a threat to regional stability.\n\n### Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating in recent years, driven by a combination of factors, including China's growing military capabilities, its increasingly assertive foreign policy, and the ongoing rivalry between the CPC and the ROC. In 2019, the CPC passed a new national security law, which further integrated Taiwan into China's national security framework and tightened the screws on Taiwan's ability to engage in international diplomacy. The law also effectively ended the \"one country, two systems\" framework, which had allowed Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy since the handover in 1997.\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan were seen as a deliberate provocation by the PLA, designed to test Taiwan's defenses and demonstrate China's military capabilities. The exercises involved a large number of aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, and transport planes, as well as ships and submarines. The PLA also conducted live-fire exercises and simulated amphibious assaults on Taiwan's coastlines.\n\n**Military exercises**\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan involved a range of military assets and operations. The exercises were designed to demonstrate China's military capabilities and test Taiwan's defenses.\n\n*   **Air operations**: The PLA conducted a large number of sorties over the Taiwan Strait, with aircraft flying as close as 30 km to the island. The exercises involved a range of aircraft, including Su-30 fighter jets, H-6 bombers, and Y-20 transport planes.\n*   **Naval operations**: The PLA Navy conducted a series of naval exercises in the Taiwan Strait, with ships and submarines operating in the area.

This group's characteristics, behaviors, and values are a topic of interest in contemporary society.\n\n# Etymology\n------------\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Zoomer\" and \"millennial,\" with \"Zoomer\" being a colloquialism for members of Generation Z. The term was coined to describe the unique characteristics and experiences of individuals who are caught between the two generations. It is essential to note that the definition and boundaries of the Zillennial generation are still being debated and refined.\n\n# Birth Date and Age Range\n---------------------------\n\nThe exact birth dates and age range of Zillennials are not universally agreed upon. However, based on the commonly accepted birth years of millennials (1981-1996) and Gen Z (1997-2012), Zillennials are often considered to be born between 1997 and 2010. This age range allows for a smoother transition between the two generations, as individuals born in this period may have grown up with similar cultural and technological influences.\n\n# Characteristics\n-----------------\n\n## Arts and Culture\n-------------------\n\nZillennials are often associated with a unique cultural identity that reflects their position between two generations. They have grown up with a diverse range of art forms, music genres, and social media platforms that have shaped their tastes and preferences. For instance, Zillennials are more likely to enjoy a mix of traditional and digital art forms, such as graphic novels, anime, and video games. They are also more likely to appreciate a wide range of musical genres, from hip-hop to electronic dance music.\n\n## Economic Activity\n-------------------\n\nZillennials are entering the workforce at a time of great economic uncertainty. They are likely to face challenges such as high levels of student debt, limited job opportunities, and rising housing costs. As a result, Zillennials are often forced to be creative and resourceful in their economic activities, such as freelancing, entrepreneurship, and online work. They are also more likely to prioritize work-life balance and flexibility, which can lead to a greater emphasis on remote work and flexible scheduling.\n\n## Health\n---------\n\nZillennials are growing up in a society that is increasingly aware of the importance of mental health. They are more likely to prioritize self-care and wellness, and to seek help when they need it. However, they are also more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to the pressures of social media, academic expectations, and economic uncertainty. As a result, Zillennials are often seeking out alternative forms of therapy and support, such as mindfulness, meditation, and online communities.\n\n## Personal Values\n-----------------\n\nZillennials are often associated with a set of personal values that prioritize individuality, creativity, and self-expression. They are more likely to value diversity, inclusivity, and social justice, and to be actively engaged in social and environmental causes. They are also more likely to prioritize authenticity and honesty, and to be willing to challenge authority and traditional norms.\n\n## Political Activity\n-------------------\n\nZillennials are entering the workforce at a time of great social and political change. They are more likely to be engaged in politics and activism, and to prioritize issues such as climate change, social justice, and economic inequality. They are also more likely to be skeptical of traditional institutions and authority, and to seek out alternative forms of politics and activism, such as online movements and grassroots organizing.\n\n## Social Life\n-------------\n\nZillennials are growing up in a society that is increasingly connected and globalized. They are more likely to have a diverse range of social connections and relationships, including online friendships and romantic relationships. They are also more likely to prioritize social media and technology in their personal and social lives, and to use these tools to manage their relationships and identities.\n\n## Technology\n------------\n\nZillennials are growing up in a world that is increasingly digital and technological. They are more likely to be fluent in a range of digital tools and platforms, including social media, video games, and online learning platforms. They are also more likely to prioritize digital literacy and digital inclusion, and to seek out alternative forms of technology and innovation, such as open-source software and DIY electronics.\n\n# See Also\n----------\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennials\n* Social media\n* Technology\n* Identity\n* Culture\n* Society\n\n# Further Reading\n----------------\n\nFor further information on the Zillennial generation, readers may wish to consult the following sources:\n\n* Pew Research Center: \"The Zillennial generation: Characteristics and trends\"\n* Forbes: \"The Zillennial generation: Born between 1997 and 2010\"\n* TIME Magazine: \"The Zillennial generation: What it means to be a Zillennial\"\n* The New York Times: \"The Zillennial generation: Navigating identity, technology, and the future\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
