The case has been ongoing since 2022, with multiple indictments, arraignments, and pretrial proceedings.\n\n# Background\n\n## Accusations of Electoral Fraud and Attempts to Overturn the Election\n\nThe case against Trump began with accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump and his allies had made numerous false claims about widespread voter fraud, which were debunked by election officials, courts, and independent fact-checking organizations. Despite these findings, Trump continued to push for recounts, audits, and other forms of intervention, which were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n## January 6 Capitol Attack and Investigations\n\nThe January 6, 2021, storming of the United States Capitol by Trump supporters further escalated tensions and investigations. The event was a violent and unprecedented attempt to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies launched investigations into the attack, which resulted in numerous arrests, charges, and convictions.\n\n# Original Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn February 4, 2022, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. returned an indictment against Trump, charging him with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. The indictment alleged that Trump had knowingly and willfully conspired to overturn the election and undermine the democratic process.\n\nTrump was arraigned on February 20, 2022, before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. His lawyers argued that the indictment was unconstitutional and that Trump was immune from prosecution. The judge rejected these arguments, and Trump was released on bail pending trial.\n\n# Superseding Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Trump, adding new charges and allegations. The superseding indictment alleged that Trump had engaged in a multi-year scheme to defraud the United States and obstruct justice. Trump was re-arraigned on April 4, 2022, before Judge Chutkan, who again rejected his lawyers' arguments and allowed the case to proceed.\n\n# Statements in the Indictment\n\n## Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment against Trump contains numerous allegations and statements, which are summarized below:\n\n### Count One: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump conspired to defraud the United States by making false claims about the 2020 election, including allegations of widespread voter fraud. It also alleges that Trump conspired with others to pressure state and local officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n### Further Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Trump made false statements to the public and the media about the election, including claims that it was \"stolen\" and that he was the \"real\" winner. It also alleges that Trump conspired with others to create and disseminate false information about the election on social media and other platforms.\n\n### Count Two: Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump conspired to obstruct an official proceeding, namely the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. It alleges that Trump and his allies made false claims about the election and used pressure tactics to try to prevent the certification from occurring.\n\n### Count Three: Obstruction of an Official Proceeding\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump obstructed an official proceeding, namely the certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. It alleges that Trump made false claims about the election and used pressure tactics to try to prevent the certification from occurring.\n\n### Count Four: Conspiracy Against Rights\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump conspired to deprive certain individuals of their rights, including their right to vote and their right to participate in the democratic process. It alleges that Trump and his allies made false claims about the election and used pressure tactics to try to prevent certain individuals from exercising their rights.\n\n# Co-Conspirators\n\nThe indictment against Trump names several co-conspirators, including:\n\n* Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, who allegedly conspired with Trump to defraud the United States and obstruct justice.\n* Sidney Powell, a lawyer who allegedly conspired with Trump to create and disseminate false information about the election on social media and other platforms.\n* Michael Flynn, a former national security advisor who allegedly conspired with Trump to pressure state and local officials to change the outcome of the election.\n\n# Pretrial Proceedings\n\n## Initial Timetable\n\nThe pretrial proceedings in the case against Trump began on February 20, 2022, with his arraignment. The court set an initial timetable for the case, which included a status hearing on March 14, 2022, and a trial date of April 17, 2023.\n\n## Protective Orders and Security Measures\n\nThe court has imposed protective orders and security measures to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information and to protect the safety of witnesses and others involved in the case.\n\n## Other Pre-Trial Motions\n\nTrump's lawyers have filed several pre-trial motions, including a motion to dismiss the indictment and a motion to suppress evidence. The court has rejected these motions, and the case continues to proceed towards trial.\n\n## Immunity Dispute\n\nThe case against Trump has also been marked by a dispute over immunity. Trump's lawyers have argued that he is immune from prosecution as a former president, while the prosecution has argued that he is not immune and should be held accountable for his actions.\n\n### Appeals\n\nTrump's lawyers have appealed the court's decision on immunity to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeals court has upheld the lower court's decision, and the case continues to proceed towards trial.\n\n### Proceedings Resulting from the Immunity Decision\n\nThe court has scheduled several proceedings to address the issue of immunity, including a hearing on April 17, 2023, to discuss the implications of the appeals court's decision.\n\n## Post-Immunity Timetable\n\nThe post-immunity timetable for the case against Trump includes a trial date of May 15, 2023, and a sentencing hearing on June 15, 2023.\n\n# Potential Witnesses and Evidence\n\n## Prosecution\n\nThe prosecution in the case against Trump has identified several potential witnesses and pieces of evidence, including:\n\n* Testimony from Trump's former lawyers and advisors, who allegedly conspired with him to defraud the United States and obstruct justice.\n* Documents and communications related to Trump's efforts to pressure state and local officials to change the outcome of the election.\n* Social media and other online platforms where Trump allegedly created and disseminated false information about the election.\n\n## Defense\n\nThe defense in the case against Trump has also identified several potential witnesses and pieces of evidence, including:\n\n* Testimony from Trump's former advisors and allies, who allegedly worked with him to create and disseminate false information about the election.\n* Documents and communications related to Trump's efforts to investigate and address alleged voter fraud.\n* Expert testimony from election security experts and other experts who allegedly debunked the prosecution's claims about the election.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Defendant\n\nTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has claimed that the indictment is a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax.\" He has also called the prosecution's witnesses and evidence \"fake\" and \"biased.\"\n\n## Republicans in Support of the Indictment\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers and commentators have expressed support for the indictment and the prosecution of Trump, including:\n\n* Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has stated that Trump's actions were \"a threat to democracy\" and \"a clear case of obstruction of justice.\"\n* Representative Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), who has stated that Trump's actions were \"a betrayal of the trust of the American people\" and \"a clear case of conspiracy to defraud the United States.\"\n\n## Republicans Opposed to the Indictment\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers and commentators have expressed opposition to the indictment and the prosecution of Trump, including:\n\n* Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), who has stated that the indictment is a \"political witch hunt\" and a \"clear abuse of power.\"\n* Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH), who has stated that the indictment is a \"partisan attack\" and a \"clear case of selective prosecution.\"\n\n## Democrats in Support of the Indictment\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers and commentators have expressed support for the indictment and the prosecution of Trump, including:\n\n* Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who has stated that Trump's actions were \"a clear threat to democracy\" and \"a clear case of obstruction of justice.\"\n* Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), who has stated that Trump's actions were \"a betrayal of the trust of the American people\" and \"a clear case of conspiracy to defraud the United States.\"\n\n# See Also\n\n* Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020\n* 2020 United States presidential election\n* January 6 United States Capitol attack\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* U.S. Department of Justice\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Accusations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the election\n##January 6 Capitol attack and investigations\n#Original indictment and arraignment\n#Superseding indictment and arraignment\n#Statements in the indictment\n##Allegations and statements\n##Count One: Conspiracy to defraud the United States\n##Further allegations and statements\n##Count Two: Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n##Count Three: Obstruction of an official proceeding\n##Count Four: Conspiracy against rights\n#Co-conspirators\n#Pretrial proceedings\n##Initial timetable\n##Protective orders and security measures\n##Other pre-trial motions\n##Immunity dispute\n###Appeals\n###Proceedings resulting from the immunity decision\n##Post-immunity timetable\n#Potential witnesses and evidence\n##Prosecution\n##Defense\n#Reactions\n##Defendant\n##Republicans in support of the indictment\n##Republicans opposed to the indictment\n##Democrats in support of the indictment\n#See also\n#References\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Jamie Bell, Anamaria Vartolomei, and Sharon Duncan-Brewster. It is a dark and atmospheric exploration of the human psyche, delving into themes of trauma, identity, and the blurred lines between reality and fantasy.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film follows the story of a young woman, Eve (Anamaria Vartolomei), who suffers from a mysterious condition that causes her to experience extreme anxiety and depression. As she struggles to cope with her emotions, Eve becomes increasingly obsessed with the Rorschach test, a psychological tool used to assess personality traits and emotional intelligence. The test, consisting of a series of inkblot images, becomes a metaphor for Eve's inner turmoil and her desperate search for meaning and connection.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Eve's obsession with the Rorschach test leads her down a dark and twisted path, where she begins to question her own identity and the nature of reality. Her grip on reality starts to slip, and she becomes convinced that the test is revealing hidden truths about herself and those around her. The film's climax is a shocking and unsettling revelation that challenges Eve's perceptions and forces her to confront the darkest corners of her own psyche.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Anamaria Vartolomei as Eve\n* Jamie Bell as Tom\n* Sharon Duncan-Brewster as Dr. Lee\n* Michael Smiley as Jack\n* Paloma Faith as Sarah\n* Benjamin Wheale as Alex\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Rorschach was first conceived by Davy Russell, who had always been fascinated by the psychological concept of the Rorschach test. Russell drew inspiration from his own experiences with anxiety and depression, as well as the works of psychologists like Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. The script for the film took several years to develop, with Russell pouring over research and consulting with experts in the field of psychology.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Rorschach began in May 2022 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in the UK and Ireland, with a mix of digital and film cameras used to capture the atmospheric and unsettling visuals. The cinematographer, Benjamin Krauss, worked closely with Russell to create a dreamlike quality that immersed the viewer in Eve's distorted world.\n\nThe cast underwent extensive training to prepare for their roles, with Anamaria Vartolomei immersing herself in the character's emotional struggles through journaling and meditation. Jamie Bell, who plays Eve's love interest, Tom, brought his own experiences with anxiety to the role, allowing him to connect with Eve on a deeper level.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe score for Rorschach was composed by Mira Aroyo, a British electronic musician known for her haunting and atmospheric soundscapes. Aroyo drew inspiration from the film's themes of anxiety and depression, creating a soundscape that is both unsettling and mesmerizing. The score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on percussion and strings to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nRorschach was marketed as a psychological thriller, with a focus on its dark and atmospheric visuals. The film's trailer, released in January 2023, featured a haunting score and a series of unsettling images that hinted at the film's themes of trauma and identity. The marketing campaign was aimed at fans of psychological thrillers and horror, with a focus on creating a sense of mystery and intrigue around the film.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nRorschach was released in theaters on March 17, 2023, in the UK and Ireland, with a limited release in the US and other countries. The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2023, where it received a warm reception from critics and audiences alike.\n\n### Home media\n\nRorschach was released on digital platforms on April 14, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on May 1, 2023. The home media release included a range of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with the cast and crew, and a commentary track by Davy Russell.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nRorschach performed modestly at the box office, grossing $1.2 million in its opening weekend in the UK and Ireland. The film went on to gross $5.5 million worldwide, with a strong performance in the US and other countries.\n\n### Critical response\n\nRorschach received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its atmospheric visuals, unsettling score, and Anamaria Vartolomei's performance. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 22 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nRolling Stone praised the film's \"haunting and atmospheric visuals\", while The Guardian noted its \"stunning performances\" and \"thought-provoking themes\". Variety called the film \"a masterclass in atmospheric tension\", while The Hollywood Reporter praised its \"unflinching and unsettling\" portrayal of mental illness.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Rorschach on IMDb\n* Rorschach at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Rorschach at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rorschach_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The monument was erected in 1980 and bears a series of cryptic and philosophical inscriptions that have sparked widespread interest and debate. The Guidestones are a prominent tourist attraction in the region, and their enigmatic nature has led to a wide range of interpretations and conspiracy theories.\n\n**History**\n\n### Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were designed by an anonymous individual who used the pseudonym \"R.C. Christian\" to communicate with the construction company. The monument was built by Elberton Granite Finishing Company, a local firm that specializes in stone fabrication. The Guidestones are constructed from six granite slabs weighing a total of 119 tons, set in a Y shape to form a large triangle.\n\n### Reaction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were completed in March 1980 and unveiled to the public on March 22. The event was attended by local officials, media representatives, and a small crowd of onlookers. The monument's design and inscriptions sparked immediate interest and curiosity, with many people expressing a mix of fascination and unease.\n\n### Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were vandalized and partially destroyed. A man identifying himself as \"Rayshan Stone\" claimed responsibility for the act, stating that he was motivated by a desire to \"get rid of the hate\" and \"bring people together.\" The Guidestones' main inscription was partially destroyed, and several of the monument's stones were toppled.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Guidestones, local authorities and the monument's owner, Mike Peterson, called for the preservation and restoration of the remaining structure. The incident sparked a heated debate about the value and significance of the monument, with some arguing that it was a valuable piece of public art and others seeing it as a divisive and provocative symbol.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are a striking example of modern monumental architecture, with a focus on philosophical and spiritual themes. The monument's design is a deliberate blend of ancient and modern elements, reflecting the complex and often conflicting ideas that underlie its inscriptions.\n\n### Inscriptions\n\nThe main inscription on the Guidestones is a set of ten principles, written in eight languages (English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, and Russian). The inscriptions are written in a clear, sans-serif font and are arranged in a deliberate pattern to convey a sense of unity and balance. The principles are as follows:\n\n1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.\n3. Unite humanity with a living new language.\n4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.\n5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\n6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\n7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\n8. Balance personal rights with social duties.\n9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.\n10. Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature.\n\n### Explanatory tablet\n\nThe Guidestones also feature an explanatory tablet that provides additional context and information about the monument. The tablet is inscribed with the following text:\n\n\"Let these be guidelines for humanity.\"\n\n### Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are constructed from six granite slabs weighing a total of 119 tons. The monument stands 19.67 feet (6 meters) tall and 16 feet (4.9 meters) wide at its base. The Guidestones are set in a Y shape to form a large triangle, with each stone sloping at an angle of 45 degrees.\n\n### Guidestone languages\n\nThe main inscription on the Guidestones is written in eight languages:\n\n1. English\n2. Spanish\n3. Swahili\n4. Hindi\n5. Arabic\n6. Hebrew\n7. Chinese\n8. Russian\n\n### Astronomical features\n\nThe Guidestones are aligned with several celestial bodies and events, including the rising and setting of the sun and the moon. The monument's design incorporates a series of astronomical features, including a calendar and a sundial.\n\n**Interpretations**\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of a wide range of interpretations and conspiracy theories. Some see the monument as a call to action, encouraging people to adopt a more sustainable and equitable way of living. Others view it as a warning or a prophecy, foretelling a catastrophic event or a global catastrophe.\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nOne of the most popular conspiracy theories surrounding the Georgia Guidestones is that they were erected by a secret society or a group of powerful individuals. Some believe that the monument is a tool for the New World Order or a means of control and manipulation. Others see it as a symbol of occultism or a representation of ancient pagan rituals.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of monuments and memorials in the United States\n* List of mysterious structures\n* List of conspiracy theories\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Guide to the Monument's History and Significance\" by Mike Peterson\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones: A Call to Action\" by R.C.

It is the physical basis for human civilization, supporting a vast array of ecosystems, landscapes, and geological features. Land is a complex and dynamic entity, shaped by geological processes, climate, and human activities.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe term \"land\" can be defined in various ways, depending on the context. In geography, land refers to the terrestrial surface of the Earth, excluding water bodies. In a broader sense, land encompasses the solid ground, soil, and underlying rock formations that support plant and animal life. In law, land is often referred to as \"real estate,\" encompassing property rights and ownership.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in Old English and Germanic languages, where it referred to the earth or soil. The term has evolved over time, influenced by various languages and cultures. In many languages, words for land are derived from words for earth, soil, or ground.\n\n**Physical Science**\n\n#### **Formation**\n\nThe formation of land is a complex process that involves the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, and erosion. The Earth's crust is constantly being shaped by these processes, resulting in the creation of new landforms and the alteration of existing ones. Continental drift, plate tectonics, and sea-floor spreading have all contributed to the formation of land over millions of years.\n\n#### **Landmasses**\n\nThe Earth's surface is divided into several large landmasses, including continents and islands. These landmasses are in constant motion, driven by plate tectonics and other geological processes. Major landmasses include Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.\n\n#### **Terrain**\n\nTerrain refers to the physical characteristics of land, including elevation, slope, and shape. Terrain can be classified into various types, including mountains, hills, plains, and valleys. Terrain is shaped by geological processes, climate, and human activities.\n\n#### **Geomorphology**\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the shape and structure of landforms. It involves the analysis of geological processes, such as erosion, deposition, and plate tectonics, that shape the Earth's surface. Geomorphology is essential for understanding landforms, landscapes, and geological hazards.\n\n#### **Climate**\n\nClimate plays a significant role in shaping landforms and ecosystems. Climate influences weather patterns, temperature, and precipitation, which in turn affect the growth of plants and animals. Climate change has significant impacts on land, including the melting of glaciers, sea-level rise, and changes in precipitation patterns.\n\n**Features**\n\n#### **Coasts and Islands**\n\nCoasts and islands are unique features of land that are shaped by the interaction of the sea and the land. Coastlines are constantly changing due to erosion, deposition, and other geological processes. Islands are landmasses that are surrounded by water and are often formed by volcanic activity, erosion, or other geological processes.\n\n#### **Mountains and Plateaus**\n\nMountains and plateaus are highland regions that are characterized by steep slopes and rugged terrain. Mountains are formed by volcanic activity, plate tectonics, and erosion, while plateaus are formed by erosion and weathering. Mountains and plateaus support a wide range of ecosystems and are often home to diverse plant and animal species.\n\n#### **Plains and Valleys**\n\nPlains and valleys are lowland regions that are characterized by flat or gently sloping terrain. Plains are formed by erosion and deposition, while valleys are formed by the flow of water. Plains and valleys support a wide range of ecosystems and are often home to diverse plant and animal species.\n\n#### **Caves and Craters**\n\nCaves and craters are unique features of land that are shaped by geological processes. Caves are formed by the dissolution of rocks, while craters are formed by volcanic activity or asteroid impacts. Caves and craters support unique ecosystems and are often home to diverse plant and animal species.\n\n**Layers**\n\n#### **Land Cover**\n\nLand cover refers to the physical characteristics of the Earth's surface, including vegetation, soil, and water. Land cover is essential for understanding ecosystems, climate, and land use. Major types of land cover include forests, grasslands, deserts, and wetlands.\n\n#### **Soil**\n\nSoil is a complex mixture of mineral and organic matter that supports plant growth. Soil is formed by the weathering of rocks and the decomposition of organic matter. Soil is a critical component of ecosystems and supports a wide range of plant and animal species.\n\n#### **Continental Crust**\n\nThe continental crust is the solid outer layer of the Earth's surface. It is composed of rocks and minerals that are formed by geological processes. The continental crust is in constant motion, driven by plate tectonics and other geological processes.\n\n**Life Science**\n\n#### **Land Biomes**\n\nLand biomes are large regions of the Earth's surface that are characterized by similar climate, vegetation, and soil conditions. Major land biomes include forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras. Land biomes support a wide range of plant and animal species and play a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate.\n\n#### **Fauna and Flora**\n\nFauna and flora refer to the animal and plant species that inhabit land. Fauna include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects, while flora include plants, trees, and other vegetation. Land supports a vast array of fauna and flora, including many endangered and threatened species.\n\n**Humans and Land**\n\n#### **Culture**\n\nHumans have a complex and diverse relationship with land, shaped by culture, history, and geography. Land is a critical component of human identity, supporting a wide range of cultural practices, traditions, and values.\n\n#### **Travel**\n\nTravel and transportation are essential for human movement and exchange on land. Land transportation includes roads, railways, and other infrastructure that facilitate human movement and trade.\n\n#### **Trade**\n\nTrade is an essential component of human activity on land, facilitating the exchange of goods, services, and ideas. Land trade includes agriculture, mining, and other extractive industries that support human well-being and economic development.\n\n#### **Land Use**\n\nLand use refers to the way humans interact with and manage land. Major types of land use include agriculture, urbanization, conservation, and recreation. Land use has significant impacts on ecosystems, climate, and human well-being.\n\n#### **Law**\n\nLand law is a complex and diverse field that governs human relationships with land. Land law includes property rights, zoning regulations, and other laws that facilitate human activity on land.\n\n#### **Geopolitics**\n\nGeopolitics is the study of how land and geography shape human politics and relationships. Geopolitics is a critical component of international relations, influencing global politics, trade, and security.\n\n**Environmental Issues**\n\n#### **Soil Degradation**\n\nSoil degradation is a critical environmental issue that affects land health and ecosystems.

The telephone revolutionized communication, transforming the way people connect with each other, conduct business, and access information. This article explores the history of the telephone in the United States, from its inception to the present day.\n\n**#AT&T and the Bell System**\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is closely tied to the development of AT&T and the Bell System. The company was founded in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, who patented the first practical telephone in 1876.\n\n### **American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)**\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1881 to manage the rights to Bell's patent. The company's primary goal was to establish a telephone network in the United States. In 1884, the company merged with the Western Union Telegraph Company, creating the Bell Telephone Company of North America. The company's early years were marked by rapid growth and expansion, with the number of telephones increasing from 4,000 to 30,000 between 1880 and 1890.\n\n### **AT&T (1899–1982)**\n\nIn 1899, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) was formed to manage the company's long-distance telephone network. AT&T was led by Theodore Vail, who played a significant role in shaping the company's strategy and growth. During the early 20th century, AT&T expanded its network, introducing new technologies such as automatic switching and the development of the first transcontinental telephone line in 1915.\n\n### **Research priority**\n\nAT&T's research and development department, Bell Labs, was established in 1925. The company invested heavily in research, focusing on the development of new technologies, including fiber optics, satellite communications, and microwave transmission. Bell Labs made significant contributions to the development of the transistor, the laser, and the computer chip.\n\n### **Targeting an audience**\n\nAT&T and the Bell System targeted various audiences, including urban public telephones and rural telephone service.\n\n### **Urban public telephones**\n\nIn urban areas, AT&T established public telephone booths, making it possible for people to make calls from anywhere in the city. The company also introduced coin-operated telephones, allowing people to make calls without the need for a subscription.\n\n### **Rural telephone service**\n\nIn rural areas, AT&T faced significant challenges in establishing a telephone network. The company introduced rural telephone cooperatives, which allowed farmers and rural residents to share the cost of installing and maintaining telephone lines.\n\n### **Breakup of AT&T in 1982**\n\nIn 1982, the United States Department of Justice sued AT&T, alleging that the company had engaged in anti-competitive practices and had a monopoly on the telephone industry. The lawsuit led to the breakup of AT&T into seven regional Bell operating companies, including Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, and NYNEX.\n\n**#Cellphones and Smartphones**\n\nThe development of cellphones and smartphones revolutionized the way people communicate. The first commercial cellphone was released in 1973 by Motorola, but it was not until the 1990s that cellphones became widely popular.\n\n**#Personnel**\n\nThe telephone industry employed a large number of people, including switchboard operators, laborers, and administrative staff.\n\n### **Switchboard and operators**\n\nSwitchboard operators played a crucial role in the telephone industry, connecting calls and handling customer inquiries. The work was often grueling, with operators working long hours and handling multiple calls simultaneously.\n\n### **Labor force: bias for and against women**\n\nThe telephone industry was criticized for its bias against women, who were often excluded from certain types of work due to their sex. However, women also made up a significant portion of the industry's labor force, with many working as switchboard operators and clerks.\n\n### **Strikes**\n\nThe telephone industry experienced several strikes throughout its history, including a major strike in 1946 that involved over 100,000 workers.\n\n### **Hawthorne studies**\n\nThe Hawthorne studies, conducted by researchers at Western Electric, aimed to understand the impact of workplace conditions on employee productivity. The studies revealed that employee satisfaction and productivity were influenced by a range of factors, including lighting, temperature, and social relationships.\n\n### **Employee benefits**\n\nThe telephone industry offered a range of employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off.\n\n**#Users**\n\nThe telephone industry had a significant impact on various users, including business, housewives, and individuals from different cultural backgrounds.\n\n### **Business**\n\nBusinesses used the telephone to communicate with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The telephone revolutionized the way businesses operated, allowing them to respond quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs.\n\n### **Housewives**\n\nHousewives used the telephone to communicate with family members, friends, and neighbors. The telephone also provided housewives with access to a range of services, including grocery delivery and childcare.\n\n### **Gender and culture roles**\n\nThe telephone industry reinforced traditional gender and culture roles, with women often expected to take on domestic and caregiving responsibilities. However, the telephone also provided women with opportunities to challenge these roles and pursue new careers.\n\n### **Telemarketing**\n\nTelemarketing became a significant aspect of the telephone industry, with companies using the telephone to promote products and services to customers.\n\n### **9-1-1**\n\nThe introduction of 9-1-1 emergency services revolutionized the way people responded to emergencies. The system allowed people to quickly call for help in emergency situations.\n\n### **Harassing calls**\n\nThe telephone industry experienced a problem with harassing calls, which were often made to individuals or businesses. The industry responded by introducing measures to prevent harassment, including caller ID and call-blocking technology.\n\n### **Literary fears**\n\nThe telephone industry has been the subject of literary fears, including concerns about the impact of technology on society and the loss of human connection.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* History of the telephone\n* Alexander Graham Bell\n* AT&T\n* Bell Labs\n* Switchboard operators\n* Telemarketing\n\n**#References**\n\n* \"The History of the Telephone in the United States\" by the Library of Congress\n* \"The Telephone Industry in the United States\" by the U.S. Department of Commerce\n* \"The Telephone and the Human Experience\" by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company\n\n**#Further reading**\n\n### **Social and cultural studies**\n\n* \"The Telephone and the Family\" by the National Center for Education Statistics\n* \"The Telephone and the Community\" by the U.S. Department of Commerce\n* \"The Telephone and the Economy\" by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\n**#External links**\n\n* AT&T Archives and History Center\n* Bell Labs Archives\n* United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970\n* National Center for Education Statistics, The Telephone and the Family\n* Federal Reserve Bank of New York, The Telephone and the Economy", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_the_telephone_in_the_United_States\" following this outline:\n\n#AT&T and the Bell System\n##American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n##AT&T (1899–1982)\n##Research priority\n##Targeting an audience\n###Urban public telephones\n###Rural telephone service\n##Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n#Cellphones and smartphones\n#Personnel\n##Switchboard and operators\n##Labor force: bias for and against women\n###Strikes\n##Hawthorne studies\n##Employee benefits\n#Users\n##Business\n##Housewives\n##Gender and culture roles\n##Telemarketing\n##9-1-1\n##Harassing calls\n##Literary fears\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n##Social and cultural studies\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on December 8, 1970, in Glenageary, County Dublin, Ireland, O'Connor rose to fame in the late 1980s and became a global phenomenon in the 1990s.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nSinéad O'Connor was born to John and Sean O'Connor, a family of Irish Travellers. Her early life was marked by poverty and instability, with her family moving frequently between different parts of Dublin. Despite these challenges, O'Connor's parents encouraged her to pursue her passion for music and art from a young age. She attended Scoil Mhuire secondary school in Bray, County Wicklow, where she began writing her own songs and performing with local music groups.\n\n**Music Career**\n\n### 1980s\n\nO'Connor's music career began in the late 1980s, when she formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute with her brother Joseph. They released a single, \"Cross My Heart,\" in 1986, but it was not a commercial success. Undeterred, O'Connor continued to write and record music, eventually signing with Chrysalis Records in 1987.\n\n#### 1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nO'Connor's debut album, \"The Lion and the Cobra,\" was released in 1987 to critical acclaim. The album's lead single, \"Mandinka,\" became a hit in Europe, and the album itself reached number 20 on the UK Albums Chart. Although the album did not achieve commercial success in the United States, it laid the groundwork for O'Connor's future success.\n\n### 1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n\nO'Connor's second album, \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got,\" was released in 1990 to widespread critical acclaim. The album's lead single, \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" became a massive hit, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart and staying there for five weeks. The album itself reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and stayed there for 60 weeks. The album's success marked a major breakthrough for O'Connor, who became a global phenomenon and a household name.\n\n#### Saturday Night Live protest\n\nOn October 3, 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL) and performed \"Success Has Made a Failure of Our Home.\" During her performance, she tore up a photograph of Pope John Paul II, sparking controversy and outrage. The incident was widely covered in the media, with many critics accusing O'Connor of being anti-Catholic and disrespecting the Pope. However, O'Connor maintained that her actions were a protest against the Catholic Church's handling of the child abuse scandal and its treatment of women.\n\n### 1993–2000\n\nIn the mid-1990s, O'Connor's music career began to slow down, and she struggled with personal demons, including depression and addiction. She released several albums during this period, including \"Am I Not Your Girl?\" (1992) and \"Universal Mother\" (1995), but none of them achieved the commercial success of her earlier work.\n\n### 2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, O'Connor continued to release music, but with less frequency. She released the album \"Faith and Courage\" in 2000, which marked a return to her earlier sound. However, the album was not well received by critics or fans, and O'Connor's career continued to decline.\n\n### 2010s\n\nIn the 2010s, O'Connor experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to the success of her 2012 album \"The Silent Vigil.\" However, her personal life continued to be marked by struggles with addiction and mental health. She released the album \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss\" in 2014, which included a duet with Mavis Staples on the song \"Take Me to Church.\"\n\n### 2020–2023: Memoir and death of son\n\nIn 2020, O'Connor released her memoir, \"Rememberings,\" which chronicled her life and career. The book was well received by critics and fans, and marked a new chapter in O'Connor's life. However, in 2022, O'Connor's life was marked by tragedy when her 17-year-old son, Shane, died by suicide. O'Connor has since become an advocate for mental health awareness and has spoken publicly about the importance of seeking help and support.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\n### Marriages and Children\n\nO'Connor has been married five times, including to John Reynolds, Nick McCabe, Barry Herridge, and Jim Iovine. She has four children, including Shane, who passed away in 2022. O'Connor has been open about her experiences with motherhood and has written about her struggles with parenting in her memoir.\n\n### Other Relationships\n\nO'Connor has been in several high-profile relationships throughout her career, including with actor Liam Neeson and musician Steve Levine. She has also been open about her experiences with polyamory and non-monogamy.\n\n### Homes\n\nO'Connor has lived in several different countries throughout her career, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. She currently resides in the United States.\n\n### Sexuality\n\nO'Connor has identified as lesbian and has been open about her experiences as a queer woman. She has been in several same-sex relationships throughout her career.\n\n### Politics\n\nO'Connor has been involved in several political causes throughout her career, including the anti-apartheid movement and the fight against the Catholic Church's handling of the child abuse scandal.\n\n### Religion\n\nO'Connor was raised Catholic and has been critical of the Catholic Church's handling of the child abuse scandal. She has also been open about her experiences with spirituality and has written about her interest in Buddhism and other Eastern spiritual traditions.\n\n### Health\n\nOConnor has struggled with addiction and mental health issues throughout her career, including depression and anxiety. She has been open about her experiences and has used her platform to raise awareness about mental health issues.\n\n### Death\n\nO'Connor is still alive.\n\n**Tributes**\n\nO'Connor has been the subject of several tributes and accolades throughout her career, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. She has also been named one of the greatest singers of all time by several publications, including Rolling Stone and The Guardian.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nO'Connor's music and persona have been referenced and parodied in several different forms of media, including music, film, and television. She has been the subject of several documentaries and has been featured in several different TV shows and films.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* \"The Lion and the Cobra\" (1987)\n* \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\" (1990)\n* \"Am I Not Your Girl?\" (1992)\n* \"Universal Mother\" (1995)\n* \"Faith and Courage\" (2000)\n* \"The Quiet Revolution\" (2003)\n* \"The Silent Vigil\" (2012)\n* \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss\" (2014)\n* \"No Line on the Horizon\" (2016)\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" (1993)\n* \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss\" (2014)\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (1991)\n* Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (2008)\n* MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video (1990)\n* Billboard Music Award for Top Female Artist (1991)\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Irish musicians\n* List of lesbian musicians\n* List of people who have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive biography of Sinéad O'Connor, covering her life and career from her early days as a child in Ireland to her current status as a renowned singer-songwriter and activist.\n\n**References**\n\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"Rememberings.\" HarperCollins, 2020.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss.\" Chrysalis Records, 2014.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"The Silent Vigil.\" Chrysalis Records, 2012.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"Faith and Courage.\" Chrysalis Records, 2000.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"Universal Mother.\" Chrysalis Records, 1995.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"Am I Not Your Girl?\" Chrysalis Records, 1992.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got.\" Chrysalis Records, 1990.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"The Lion and the Cobra.\" Chrysalis Records, 1987.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\" HarperCollins, 2013.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"The Quiet Revolution.\" HarperCollins, 2004.\n* O'Connor, Sinéad. \"Faith and Courage.\" HarperCollins, 2001.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Sinéad O'Connor's official website\n* Sinéad O'Connor's official Facebook page\n* Sinéad O'Connor's official Twitter page\n* Sinéad O'Connor's official Instagram page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sinéad_O'Connor\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Music career\n##1980s\n##1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n##1990–1993: I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\n###Saturday Night Live protest\n##1993–2000\n##2000s\n##2010s\n##2020–2023: Memoir and death of son\n#Personal life\n##Marriages and children\n##Other relationships\n##Homes\n##Sexuality\n##Politics\n##Religion\n##Health\n##Death\n#Tributes\n#In popular culture\n#Discography\n#Filmography\n#Awards\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a member of the genus Torreya, which is native to the southeastern United States. This species is particularly notable for its unique characteristics and the catastrophic decline of its population in the early 20th century.\n\n# Species discovery\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first described by the American botanist Asa Gray in 1853. Gray discovered the species while collecting plant specimens in the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida. At the time, the species was thought to be a new species of Pinus, but subsequent studies revealed its true identity as a member of the genus Torreya.\n\n# Taxonomy and naming\n\nThe genus Torreya was established by the French botanist Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart in 1825. The name \"Torreya\" is derived from the Spanish word \"torreya,\" which refers to a type of pine tree. Within the genus Torreya, T. taxifolia is considered to be a distinct species due to its unique characteristics, including its leaves and cones.\n\n# Type species of genus Torreya\n\nTorreya taxifolia is the type species of the genus Torreya. This means that it serves as the reference species for the genus, and its characteristics are used to define the genus as a whole.\n\n# Common names\n\nT. taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida torreya. It is also sometimes referred to as the gopherwood or the stinking cypress, due to its unpleasant odor when cut.\n\n# Description\n\n## Technical description\n\nT. taxifolia is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height. Its trunk is straight and cylindrical, with a diameter of up to 1 meter. The bark is reddish-brown and fissured. The leaves are needle-like, with a length of up to 2 centimeters and a width of up to 1 millimeter. They are dark green on top and pale green on the bottom.\n\n## Subcanopy growth adaptations\n\nOne of the unique characteristics of T. taxifolia is its ability to grow in the subcanopy layer of forests. This means that it can tolerate low levels of light and grow in areas where other trees are unable to survive. This adaptation allows T. taxifolia to thrive in a variety of environments, from wet to dry.\n\n# Distribution\n\n## Wild population\n\nT. taxifolia is native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the states of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. Its wild population is found in forests, swamps, and woodlands, typically in areas with well-drained soils.\n\n## Prehistoric distribution\n\nFossil evidence suggests that T. taxifolia was once more widely distributed in the southeastern United States. Fossils of the species have been found in areas that are now submerged under water, suggesting that the species was once found in coastal areas.\n\n# Ecology\n\n## Habitat\n\nT. taxifolia is typically found in forests, swamps, and woodlands, where it grows in the subcanopy layer. It prefers well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of soil types.\n\n## Seed dispersal\n\nT. taxifolia produces cones that contain seeds. The seeds are dispersed by wind, water, and animals, allowing the species to spread to new areas.\n\n# Extinction threats\n\n## Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n\nT. taxifolia has a restricted range size, which makes it vulnerable to extinction. The species is found in a limited area, and any threat to that area can have a significant impact on the species as a whole.\n\n## The die-off begins\n\nIn the early 20th century, a catastrophic decline of the T. taxifolia population began. The exact cause of the decline is still unknown, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including disease, habitat loss, and human activity.\n\n## The role of pathogens in the die-off\n\nOne of the main factors thought to be responsible for the decline of T. taxifolia is a stem canker fungus. The fungus infects the roots and stems of the trees, causing them to die. This fungus is thought to have been introduced to the area by humans, either through the movement of infected plants or through the use of contaminated soil.\n\n## The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n\nHabitat deterioration is also thought to have played a role in the decline of T. taxifolia. The destruction of forests and the degradation of soil quality have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the species.\n\n## Focus on a stem canker fungus\n\nResearchers have focused on the stem canker fungus as a potential cause of the decline of T. taxifolia. The fungus is thought to be introduced to the area by humans, and its spread is facilitated by human activity.\n\n## Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n\nDespite research and investigation, the ultimate cause of the decline of T. taxifolia remains unknown. It is thought that a combination of factors, including disease, habitat loss, and human activity, may have contributed to the decline.\n\n# Conservation actions\n\n## Protect areas in species range\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect areas where T. taxifolia is found. National parks and wildlife refuges have been established to provide a safe habitat for the species.\n\n## List the species as endangered\n\nT. taxifolia has been listed as an endangered species by the IUCN. This listing recognizes the species' vulnerability to extinction and provides a framework for conservation efforts.\n\n## In situ habitat improvement\n\nConservation efforts are focused on improving the habitat of T. taxifolia in situ. This includes the restoration of forests and the protection of soil quality.\n\n## Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n\nEx situ genetic safeguarding is also being used to conserve T. taxifolia. This involves the collection and storage of seeds and plant material in a controlled environment.\n\n## Document early horticultural plantings\n\nResearchers have documented early horticultural plantings of T. taxifolia. This has helped to identify the early spread of the species and the impact of human activity on its population.\n\n# Conservation controversies\n\n## Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n\nOne of the controversies surrounding the conservation of T. taxifolia is the issue of assisted migration. This involves the movement of plants from one area to another to help reestablish a population. However, there is debate about the ethics and effectiveness of this approach.\n\n## Management of seeds produced ex situ\n\nThe management of seeds produced ex situ is another controversy. Seeds produced from official plantings are often managed in a controlled environment, while seeds accessed by citizens are often not. This raises questions about the fairness and effectiveness of conservation efforts.\n\n### Seeds produced from official plantings\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings are often managed in a controlled environment. This involves the collection of seeds from plants grown in a nursery or greenhouse, and the storage of those seeds in a controlled environment.\n\n### Seeds accessed by citizens\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens are often not managed in a controlled environment. This involves the collection of seeds from plants grown in the wild, and the storage of those seeds in a personal collection.\n\nThis concludes the article on Torreya taxifolia, a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. The species is notable for its unique characteristics and the catastrophic decline of its population in the early 20th century. Conservation efforts are underway to protect areas where the species is found, and to improve its habitat in situ. However, controversies surrounding assisted migration and the management of seeds produced ex situ remain unresolved.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Torreya_taxifolia\" following this outline:\n\n#Species discovery\n#Taxonomy and naming\n#Type species of genus Torreya\n#Common names\n#Description\n##Technical description\n##Subcanopy growth adaptations\n#Distribution\n##Wild population\n##Prehistoric distribution\n#Ecology\n##Habitat\n##Seed dispersal\n#Extinction threats\n##Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n##The die-off begins\n##The role of pathogens in the die-off\n##The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n##Focus on a stem canker fungus\n##Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n#Conservation actions\n##Protect areas in species range\n##List the species as endangered\n##In situ habitat improvement\n##Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n##Document early horticultural plantings\n#Conservation controversies\n##Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n##Management of seeds produced ex situ\n###Seeds produced from official plantings\n###Seeds accessed by citizens\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is also known as the foetid anagyris or stinking anagyris.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, beans, and peas. The plant is known for its unique adaptations to growth in winter and early spring, as well as its role as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant. However, it also has toxic properties that can pose a threat to humans and animals.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Greece, Turkey, and parts of North Africa. It has also been naturalized in other parts of Europe, including France, Spain, and Italy. The plant typically grows in areas with well-drained soil and full sun, often in dry, rocky outcrops.\n\n**Habitat**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a plant of dry, rocky areas, often growing in crevices and cracks in the ground. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and full sun, where other plants may struggle to grow. The plant's adaptability to these conditions has led to its use as a pioneer species in revegetation projects.\n\n**Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring**\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that enable it to grow in the winter and early spring months, when other plants are dormant. One of these adaptations is the shedding of its leaves in the summer, allowing it to conserve water and protect itself from the heat.\n\n### Summer leaf-fall\n\nIn the summer months, Anagyris foetida sheds its leaves, which helps to conserve water and reduce transpiration. This process is known as summer leaf-fall. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and feathery, and they fall off the plant in the summer months.\n\n### Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which feed on the plant's nectar and transfer pollen from one plant to another. The plant's flowers are typically pink or purple and are arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. The flowers are rich in nectar and are an important food source for many bird species.\n\n**Seed dispersal**\n\nAnagyris foetida disperses its seeds through several mechanisms, including soil seed banks and animal vectors.\n\n### Soil seed banks\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, often germinating in response to changes in the environment. This process is known as a soil seed bank. The plant's seeds are typically small and hard, with a tough, waterproof coat that protects them from desiccation and other forms of damage.\n\n### Olive mimicry\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have been shown to mimic the seeds of the olive tree, which is a common food source for many animals. This mimicry may help to explain the plant's seed dispersal vector.\n\n### Role of sheep\n\nSheep have been shown to play a role in the seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida. The seeds are often ingested by sheep, which then deposit them in new locations, often in areas with suitable growing conditions.\n\n### Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nOther possible mammalian and avian vectors of Anagyris foetida seeds include rabbits, deer, and various bird species. However, the role of these vectors in seed dispersal is not well understood.\n\n### Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nIn addition to the known vectors, there may be other, unknown seed dispersal vectors of Anagyris foetida. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of seed dispersal for this plant.\n\n### Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nAnagyris foetida seeds have tough, waterproof seed coats that protect them from desiccation and other forms of damage. This adaptation helps to ensure the survival of the seeds in the environment.\n\n**Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant**\n\nAnagyris foetida is a valuable plant for several reasons. As a nitrogen-fixing pioneer species, it helps to increase the fertility of poor soils, making them more suitable for other plants. As a companion plant, it provides a habitat for beneficial insects and other organisms, which can help to control pests and diseases.\n\n**Medicinal use**\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for its antispasmodic properties. However, its use is not well understood, and further research is needed to fully explore its potential as a medicinal plant.\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nAnagyris foetida is toxic to humans and animals, due to the presence of alkaloids such as anagyrine. These alkaloids can cause a range of symptoms, including birth defects, and are particularly hazardous to children.\n\n### Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n\nAnagyrine, an alkaloid found in Anagyris foetida, has been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies. This has significant implications for human health, particularly in areas where the plant is commonly consumed.\n\n### Danger to children\n\nChildren are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of Anagyris foetida, due to their developing bodies and higher exposure to the plant's alkaloids.\n\n### Hazardous tainting of milk products\n\nAnagyris foetida has been shown to contaminate milk products, posing a significant risk to human health.\n\n### Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n\nThere have been reported cases of accidental poisoning in Algeria, where Anagyris foetida was ingested in error. These cases highlight the need for greater awareness of the plant's toxicity.\n\n**Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous**\n\nAnagyris foetida has been referenced in several works of literature, including the ancient Greek comedy \"Lysistrata\".\n\n### Lysistrata\n\nIn the play \"Lysistrata\", the character of Lysistrata uses Anagyris foetida to lure men into a trap, highlighting the plant's reputation as a seductive and alluring species.\n\n### Persistence of name\n\nThe name \"Anagyris\" has persisted in various forms throughout history, often reflecting the plant's association with fertility and abundance.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* Anagyris foetida\n* Avian pollinators\n* Avian nectar thief\n* Insect pollinators\n\n**See also**\n\n* Fabaceae\n* Legume\n* Nitrogen fixation\n* Seed dispersal\n* Alpine plant\n* Mediterranean flora", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company has gained international recognition for its innovative designs and record-breaking dives.\n\n**Background**\n\nOceanGate's operations are centered around the development and deployment of advanced submersibles that can reach great depths and operate in a variety of marine environments. The company's mission is to push the boundaries of human exploration and scientific discovery, while also promoting sustainable and responsible marine practices.\n\n**History**\n\n### 2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n\nOceanGate was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush, a seasoned entrepreneur and deep-sea enthusiast. Initially, the company focused on developing its first submersible, Antipodes, which was designed for commercial diving and underwater construction applications. In 2011, OceanGate acquired the rights to the Antipodes design and began its production. The Antipodes submersible made its first dive in 2012, and it has since become a reliable and versatile vessel for a variety of operations.\n\n### 2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n\nFollowing the success of Antipodes, OceanGate turned its attention to the development of its second submersible, Cyclops 1. Designed for greater depth and longer duration operations, Cyclops 1 was an ambitious project that pushed the limits of submersible design. Although the company faced several challenges during the construction process, Cyclops 1 was finally completed in 2015. As the project neared completion, Wolf Söhnlein, a key figure in OceanGate's development team, left the company to pursue other ventures. Despite this setback, Cyclops 1 has since become a valuable asset for the company, enabling a range of scientific and commercial operations.\n\n### 2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nWith Cyclops 1 in service, OceanGate began to expand its fleet with the introduction of Titan, a state-of-the-art submersible designed for deep-sea exploration and tourism. Titan made its maiden dive in 2019 and has since become a flagship vessel for the company, offering tourists the chance to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. In 2020, OceanGate announced plans to dive to the Titanic's grand staircase, which had never been done before. The company successfully completed the dive in 2022, marking a major milestone in its history.\n\n### 2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n\nOn June 18, 2023, tragedy struck when Titan imploded while exploring the Titanic's wreckage. Stockton Rush, the company's founder and CEO, was on board and lost his life in the incident. The cause of the implosion is still under investigation, but it is believed to have been related to a combination of factors, including equipment failure and human error.\n\n**Submersibles**\n\n### Antipodes\n\nThe Antipodes submersible was OceanGate's first vessel, designed for commercial diving and underwater construction applications. Built in 2011, Antipodes made its first dive in 2012 and has since become a reliable and versatile vessel for a variety of operations. The submersible has a depth rating of 4,000 meters (13,124 feet) and can accommodate a crew of three.\n\n### Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is OceanGate's second submersible, designed for greater depth and longer duration operations. Completed in 2015, Cyclops 1 has a depth rating of 6,500 meters (21,325 feet) and can accommodate a crew of three.\n\n### Titan\n\nTitan is OceanGate's flagship submersible, designed for deep-sea exploration and tourism. Completed in 2019, Titan has a depth rating of 12,500 meters (41,013 feet) and can accommodate a crew of five.\n\n**Associated entities**\n\nOceanGate has partnered with several organizations and companies to support its operations and research initiatives. These include:\n\n* Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI): A leading research organization that has collaborated with OceanGate on several projects.\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): A US government agency that has partnered with OceanGate on research initiatives related to marine conservation and sustainability.\n* DeepFlight Super Falcon 3S: A company that has supplied OceanGate with high-performance submersibles for various operations.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Manned submersible\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Underwater construction\n* Titanic (ship)\n* Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)\n\n**References**\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"OceanGate: A New Era in Manned Submersible Operations\" by Stockton Rush (2015)\n* \"Deep-Sea Exploration: The Future of OceanGate\" by Wolf Söhnlein (2016)\n* \"Titanic: The Final Dive\" by OceanGate (2022)\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate official website\n* Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) website\n* National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"OceanGate\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##2009–2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n##2013–2016: Construction of Cyclops and Söhnlein's departure\n##2016–2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n##2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n#Submersibles\n##Antipodes\n##Cyclops 1\n##Titan\n#Associated entities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season premiered on April 3, 2023, on Rede Globo and concluded on August 6, 2023.\n\n**The Game**\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced several new twists and changes to the traditional gameplay.\n\n### Final Prize Change Throughout the Season\n\nFor the first time in the show's history, the final prize was changed throughout the season. The original final prize was R$1.5 million, but it was later doubled to R$3 million due to high ratings and popular demand. This change was announced during a live episode and caused a stir among the housemates.\n\n### Super HoH\n\nThis season introduced the concept of \"Super HoH\" (Head of Household), where the winner of the HoH competition would not only be immune from nomination but also get to choose the theme of the next challenge. This twist added an extra layer of strategy to the game, as housemates had to carefully consider which theme to choose in order to benefit themselves and their allies.\n\n### Withdrawal Button\n\nA new twist was introduced in the form of the \"Withdrawal Button,\" which allowed a housemate to withdraw from the game at any time. However, this decision would also result in a penalty, such as losing a portion of the final prize or being forced to leave the house immediately. This twist added an element of risk to the game, as housemates had to weigh the potential benefits of staying in the game against the potential costs of withdrawal.\n\n### FeedBBB\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new live feed platform, FeedBBB, which allowed viewers to watch the housemates 24/7. This platform provided an unprecedented level of access to the housemates and their interactions, giving viewers a deeper look into the game.\n\n### Selective Collection\n\nThis season introduced a new challenge called \"Selective Collection,\" where housemates would have to collect items from around the house that matched a specific theme. The twist was that each housemate would have a limited amount of time to collect the items, and the housemate who collected the most items would win a reward.\n\n### Evicted's Message\n\nA new twist was introduced in the form of \"Evicted's Message,\" where the evicted housemate would have the opportunity to leave a message for the remaining housemates. However, this message would be revealed after the eviction, and the remaining housemates would have to decide whether to take the message into consideration when making their decisions.\n\n### Glass House\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new challenge called \"Glass House,\" where housemates would have to live in a glass house with no privacy. The twist was that the housemates would have to navigate the challenges of living in a glass house while also competing in the challenges.\n\n### Duos Twist\n\nThis season introduced a new twist called \"Duos,\" where housemates would be paired up into duos and would have to compete together in challenges. The twist was that the duos would be formed randomly, and housemates would have to adapt to their new partner in order to succeed.\n\n### Secret Room\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new twist called \"Secret Room,\" where a housemate would be hidden in a secret room and would have the opportunity to watch the other housemates and influence their decisions. The twist was that the housemate in the secret room would have to remain hidden, and the other housemates would have to figure out who was watching them.\n\n### Higher Power\n\nThis season introduced a new twist called \"Higher Power,\" where a housemate would be given the power to make decisions for the other housemates. The twist was that the housemate with the higher power would have to make decisions that would benefit the entire house, rather than just themselves.\n\n### White Room\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new challenge called \"White Room,\" where housemates would have to navigate a white room filled with obstacles. The twist was that the housemates would have to work together to navigate the room and complete the challenges.\n\n### Housemate Exchange\n\nThis season introduced a new twist called \"Housemate Exchange,\" where two housemates would be exchanged between the house and the outside world. The twist was that the exchanged housemate would have to adapt to a new environment and make new connections in order to succeed.\n\n### Repechage Twist\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new twist called \"Repechage,\" where a housemate who was previously evicted would have the opportunity to return to the game. The twist was that the returned housemate would have to compete against the other housemates in order to stay in the game.\n\n### Vote to Save\n\nThis season introduced a new twist called \"Vote to Save,\" where housemates would have the opportunity to vote to save a fellow housemate from eviction. The twist was that the housemate with the most votes would be saved, and the housemate with the fewest votes would be evicted.\n\n### Power of Veto\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new twist called \"Power of Veto,\" where a housemate would be given the power to veto the nominations of the other housemates. The twist was that the housemate with the power of veto would have to decide whether to use their power or not.\n\n### Joker Power\n\nThis season introduced a new twist called \"Joker Power,\" where a housemate would be given a joker power that would allow them to make a special move in the game. The twist was that the housemate with the joker power would have to use it wisely in order to succeed.\n\n### Power of No\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new twist called \"Power of No,\" where a housemate would be given the power to say no to a challenge or a nomination. The twist was that the housemate with the power of no would have to use it strategically in order to benefit themselves and their allies.\n\n### Big Phone\n\nThis season introduced a new twist called \"Big Phone,\" where a housemate would have access to a special phone that would allow them to make a call to the outside world. The twist was that the housemate with the big phone would have to use it wisely in order to get an advantage in the game.\n\n### The Counterattack\n\nBig Brother Brasil 23 introduced a new twist called \"The Counterattack,\" where a housemate would have the opportunity to make a counterattack against a fellow housemate.

The invasion has resulted in a significant humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians killed or injured, and millions displaced.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Post-Soviet relations\n\nThe relationship between Russia and Ukraine has been complex and often contentious since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991, and Russia has since sought to exert its influence over the country. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted in a popular uprising, leading to the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the start of a conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n### Ukrainian revolution, Russian intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nThe Ukrainian revolution of 2014 was a wave of protests and demonstrations that began in November 2013 and culminated in the ousting of Yanukovych in February 2014. The revolution was sparked by a decision by Yanukovych to reject a trade agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014 was widely condemned by the international community, and led to the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, known as the War in Donbas, began in April 2014 and has continued to this day, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations and human rights abuses.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Putin's invasion announcement\n\nOn 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, citing the need to protect Russian-speaking citizens in the country. The announcement was widely seen as a pretext for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and was met with international condemnation.
